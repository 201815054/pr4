The e-commerce giant's announcement on Thursday could cause other brands, manufacturers, retailers, and logistics companies to have to invest more aggressively to compete with Amazon and its delivery, analysts said.
Retailers in recent years have poured billions into ecommerce and faster shipping options and are trying to close the gap with Amazon.
""This is about making it more expensive to catch up and affirms our world view that only the largest and smartest will survive,"" Bernstein analyst Brandon Fletcher said.
The move is expected to heighten consumer expectations on e-commerce delivery just like Amazon did with its two-day shipping option for members of its loyalty club Prime, noted analysts.
""The faster you ship, the more people buy,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.
The challenge for non-Amazon players was that very few of the existing logistics and parcel delivery players now have the ability to do nationwide one-day delivery,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak said. 
""And even fewer can do it at the vast scale and reasonable cost that AMZN would need for Prime delivery,"" Nowak said in a note.
Walmart Inc's shares fell about 3 percent, while Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) dropped about 5 percent in morning trade.

Shares of Kohl's Corp, Macy's Inc and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) fell about 1 percent. Grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co was nearly 3 percent lower, while consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Inc dropped 2.1 percent.

4,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>","Ferrexpo Plunges as Auditor, Directors Resign Amid Charity Probe","(Bloomberg) -- Ukrainian iron-ore producer Ferrexpo Plc plunged the most in three years as its auditor and two directors resigned amid a money laundering investigation at a charity supported by the company.
Ferrexpo announced on Friday morning that Deloitte LLP had resigned without providing any details about the reason. Three days ago, the company disclosed a disagreement between the auditor and Ferrexpo’s board over the role of majority shareholder and Chief Executive Officer Kostyantin Zhevago at the charity, called Blooming Land.
The shares fell 28 percent, the most since 2015, to 192.60 pence in London, wiping out more than $500 million in market value.
For Ferrexpo, the investigation into the charity is fueling worries about governance and financial controls at the company. Ukrainian authorities are probing whether the charitable foundation was used to launder money and evade taxes. There are indications that some funds may have been “misappropriated,” Ferrexpo said on Tuesday.
The company announced late on Friday that two directors, Mary Reilly and Bert Nacken, who had both been part of the audit committee, will resign from the board.
“Any further potential problems with corporate governance are able to trigger the stock’s selloff, even if they do not significantly undermine the current sound fundamentals of the company,” said Alexander Martynenko, the head of corporate research at Investment Capital Ukraine LLC in Kiev.
On Tuesday, Ferrexpo said its board had a ""unanimous view"" that Zhevago didn’t have influence over the charity. That clashed with Deloitte’s assessment. The auditors have been ""unable to conclude"" whether the CEO has significant control, according to Ferrexpo’s statement.
If Ferrexpo board members start changing their opinion, or if the U.K. or Swiss regulators start questioning the links between Blooming Land and Zhevago, the company could face further trouble, wrote Dmytro Khoroshun, an analyst at Concorde Capital in Kiev.
“If Zhevago was able to prove he was not related to Blooming Land, he could have done so already at the stage of Deloitte’s inquiry, preventing the auditor from resigning,” he said in a note.
Accounting Irregularities
The problems at Blooming Land came to light earlier this year after Ferrexpo’s auditors received bank statements from the foundation containing “irregularities.” Ferrexpo has set up an independent review committee to investigate discrepancies in payments to the charitable foundation, established primarily to coordinate the company’s philanthropic activities.
A spokeswoman for Deloitte and a spokesman for Ferrexpo declined to comment. Under U.K. rules, the auditor is likely to make its resignation letter public in the next two weeks.
Through donations to Blooming Land, Ferrexpo says it supports charitable activities in Ukraine. A unit of the iron-ore miner gave the foundation about $110 million over the past six years to fund causes such as diabetes awareness and care of the elderly.
The resignation of Deloitte also comes as the so-called big four accounting firms face increased scrutiny. Last week, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority renewed its demand for the firms to split their operations into separate business units.
Stung into action by a series of high-profile corporate failures, the regulator said in its final report that a fragile auditing market could only be fixed with government action. The accounting industry has been under fire in the wake of corporate collapses such as those of building contractor Carillion Plc and bakery chain Patisserie Valerie Holdings Ltd.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's emissions certification process in the United States, the automaker disclosed on Friday, saying it was cooperating fully with the probe and still conducting its own internal review.
Ford said in a statement the Justice Department had notified it earlier this month of the criminal investigation, which made the automaker the latest to come under scrutiny for adherence to emissions standards by U.S. officials.
""Ford is fully cooperating with the government, and we’ll keep them posted on what we’re finding through our investigation and technical review,"" the company said.
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The Environmental Protection Agency also declined comment.
Ford has held meetings with the California Air Resources Board and EPA officials and turned over documents related to its review, a person briefed on the matter said. The No. 2 U.S. automaker has also submitted a testing plan that has been approved by regulators, the person said. The first vehicle Ford is evaluating is the 2019 Ranger pickup truck.
Ford potentially faces significant financial penalties as regulators have taken a tough line on emissions issues.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said earlier this month the agency had other enforcement actions against other automakers ""in the works."" 
""When people are not playing by the rules and they are creating more pollution ... we will catch them, we will hold them accountable,"" Wheeler said.
Ford disclosed an issue with emissions to the EPA and the California in February, and hired outside law firm Sidley Austin and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process.
Ford said previously it did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers. But the company reiterated in a regulatory filing Friday that the emissions issue does not involve the use of so-called defeat devices. (https:// U.S. and California regulators have been cracking down on automakers for emissions cheating following revelations in 2015 that German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG had used defeat devices to make models equipped with diesel engines appear to comply with emissions standards when they emitted far more pollution than allowed in real-world driving. Ford said it had been looking into concerns raised by employees since last fall that incorrect calculations were used to translate test results into vehicle mileage and emissions data submitted to regulators. Ford is evaluating changes to the process it uses to develop fuel economy and emissions figures ""including engineering, technical and governance components,"" the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said. In January, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. A Justice Department criminal investigation is pending. U.S. regulators are also investigating  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and EPA have declined to comment on the status of the probe. Daimler has declined to comment, but has previously acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States over the diesel emissions scandal, for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and it offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. 
Ford has been embarrassed in the past by errors in fuel economy claims. In 2013, the automaker cut by seven miles (11 km) per gallon the claimed fuel economy for its C-Max hybrid model following complaints that real-world mileage did not match the claimed fuel economy. In 2014, Ford lowered fuel economy ratings for six other models and offered compensation to customers.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo taps headhunter Spencer Stuart to find new CEO - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's board has retained executive search firm Spencer Stuart to hunt for a new chief executive, ideally a woman who can tackle its regulatory and public perception issues, two people familiar with the matter said.
Wells Fargo's ambition to become the only major U.S. bank with a female CEO underscores the need to restore its image with a wide range of constituents, including customers, shareholders, regulators and politicians, after it became mired in a scandal in 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.
Former CEO Tim Sloan left abruptly last month, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the scandal's fallout. 
The board plans to approach  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's Latin America chief Jane Fraser, one of the sources said. During Fraser's 15-year tenure at Citigroup, she has gained experience running consumer and commercial businesses as well as its private bank. 
Fraser could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The board also discussed approaching JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Marianne Lake, but after the bank named her to run JPMorgan's consumer lending business last week, that option became less viable, the source added. The board wants someone who can convince regulators, employees, investors and customers that the bank has fixed problems underpinning the sales scandal, the sources said.
The bank's board feels that choosing a woman might please lawmakers in Washington who have been critical not only of Wells Fargo’s misbehavior, but of the broader banking industry for a lack of diversity and gender equality, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
It also believes that such a move could bolster Wells Fargo’s image with the households of customers where women play a leading role in managing finances, one of the sources added. 
The new CEO will also have to resolve litigation and regulatory matters. There are 14 outstanding consent orders with government entities, as well as probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice.
To be sure, Spencer Stuart will approach and consider several male candidates for the CEO job as well, one of the sources said. The top priority is to find an external candidate who can navigate the bank’s regulatory issues, the source added.
Finding an outsider who meets all those qualifications and wants the job will be difficult, the sources said. There are few people with the necessary experience, even fewer of those who are women, and it is not clear if any of the obvious candidates would be open to taking the role.
The sources asked not to be identified because Wells Fargo’s board deliberations are confidential.
Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and Spencer Stuart declined to comment. 
Wells Fargo’s board has not made any public statements about its requirements for a new CEO, beyond Chair Betsy Duke saying the job should attract the “top talent in banking.”
The board wants to complete the search within the next three to six months, one of the sources said.
STALLED SHARES
After Sloan's ouster, Wells Fargo’s board appointed Allen Parker, who had been general counsel, as interim CEO. The board has said it is looking for an external candidate as a permanent replacement. It is not clear whether Parker will stay at the bank. 
Others whose names have been mentioned by analysts, recruiters and industry sources as perspective CEO candidates include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc finance chief Ruth Porat and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's chief technology officer Cathy Bessant. 
Wells Fargo shares have stalled since Sloan's departure on March 29th, while the KBW Bank index has rallied more than 7 percent.
Wells Fargo would be ""the best stock on earth to buy"" if it had the right CEO, said Greg Donaldson, chairman of Donaldson Capital Management in Indiana.
Donaldson held about 50,000 Wells Fargo shares, but sold the stake last year as problems mounted. The CEO change could convince him to re-invest, depending on who it is, he told Reuters.

""It would be very smart for them to get a woman,"" he said.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 11:35AM ET</span>",'Anemic' traffic raises doubts over Starbucks sales gains,"(Reuters) - Initial optimism over first-quarter results from  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) was waning fast on Wall Street on Friday, as analysts questioned the longer-term prospects of its new sales push given subdued overall customer traffic numbers especially in China.
The company on Thursday beat brokerage estimates for quarterly same-store sales on the back of demand for its new Cloud Macchiato, Matcha tea and cold brews in the United States.
However, BTIG's Peter Saleh was one of a number of sector analysts who said while customers forking out for higher-priced new drinks had helped drive growth in same-store sales, ""anemic"" traffic at cafes remained a concern.
He and others pointed to a 1 percent decline in footfall at cafes in the Chinese market, viewed as crucial to the chain's growth for the foreseeable future. 
More broadly, transaction numbers, the substitute analysts use for customer traffic, were unchanged in all three of the company's global regions.
Shares in the company, which hit a record high after the results on Thursday, fell 1 percent in morning trade.
""We remain cautious given near-term headwinds surrounding China, including cannibalization, increasing competition (and) a slowing economy,"" Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said. 
Starbucks has also poured money into beefing up its delivery network in China as it battles with local startup Luckin Coffee, whose speedy growth led it to file for an IPO in the United States earlier this week.
New menu items and partnerships with delivery services, the heart of the company's strategy to win back customers lost to artisanal coffee shops and cheaper fast-food rivals, did help Starbucks' sales in its home market.
However, analysts said growth in China may continue to be subdued. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expects store expansion in China to take priority over comparable sales growth. 
She downgraded her rating on Starbucks' to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"", arguing that the company facing tough sales comparisons later on in 2019 from last year and the current rich valuation of shares meant the stock had limited room to rise.
""Investors will be hesitant to invest new money in a stock with a topline that, while still strong, is unlikely to meaningfully accelerate,"" Herzog said. 
Still, the company's solid same-store growth in the United States, improving profit margins and a lower tax rate for the rest of the year led at least 6 Wall Street brokerages to raise their price targets on the stock to as high as $81.

11 of 29 brokerages rate Starbucks ""buy"" or higher, 17 ""hold"" and 1 ""sell"" or lower. Their median price target is $75.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank focused on solo destiny after Commerzbank deal demise,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Within hours of the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Christian Sewing scrambled to convince investors and employees that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) can stand on its own two feet.
The Deutsche Bank chief executive told staff, many of whom opposed a merger because of significant job losses, that while he had not been ""skeptical"" about the Commerzbank talks, he was cautious about the chances of success from the start.
And another top Deutsche Bank executive said on Friday that it had been Commerzbank that initiated the talks, suggesting there was no desperation on their part for a deal.
Commerzbank denied that version of events, ending the apparent truce between the normally highly competitive cross-town Frankfurt rivals over the past six weeks.
German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were finally dashed on Thursday when Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank ended their talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
For Sewing, the failure to clinch a deal has left the 49-year-old chief executive of Germany's largest bank, who took over just over a year ago, with his back to the wall.
Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which downgraded Deutsche Bank last year, said on Friday that Deutsche Bank ""will remain under strain"", adding that it ""seems to have acknowledged the need to adjust its strategy"". 
Under Sewing, a new leadership has tried to revive Deutsche Bank's fortunes, but it has faced money laundering allegations and failed stress tests, as well as ratings downgrades.
At the heart of the debate over its future is whether it should focus its business on Germany and draw a line under its costly global ambitions to take on Wall Street's big guns.
""MARKET PLAY""
Without a deal, Deutsche Bank now finds itself back at the mercy of equity and debt markets, with UBS analysts warning that in a ""stress scenario"" it could again ""be forced into a 'debt-driven capital increase' even with solid capital ratios"".
""Deutsche remains a levered market play vulnerable to external events,"" the UBS analysts said in a note.
Sewing, along with many analysts, believes Deutsche Bank can go it alone in the short-term, but will be counting on a turnaround in market conditions to do so in the long-run given its dependence on volatile investment bank earnings.
""To reach our return objective, we also need to see a revenue recovery in our more market-sensitive business,"" Sewing said on Friday after reporting results.
""These revenues are available to us in better market conditions given our leading positions in many of these businesses, but we need to capture them,"" he added.
Revenue at Deutsche Bank's bond trading division fell 19 percent in the first quarter, it said on Friday, underscoring weakness at its investment bank. 
If those earnings do not improve, Berlin's desire to keep its biggest bank out of foreign hands may start to wane. 

""Germany's globally active companies need competitive financial institutions that can support them around the world,"" German finance minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Corp's first-quarter profit fell 27 percent from a year earlier due to lower crude oil prices and weaker margins in its refining and chemicals businesses, but topped forecasts and signalled it is committed to buying smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The No. 2 U.S. oil and natural gas producer this week found itself in a takeover duel for Anadarko, a smaller oil and gas producer, when Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) made a $38 billion offer that topped Chevron's $33 billion bid. [nL3N226349] 
Chevron's oil and gas production rose during the quarter, and profits in its U.S. exploration business jumped 15 percent from a year earlier. But weakness in refining and international exploration knocked overall profit down 27 percent on a 6.8 percent decline in revenue. 
""Earnings declined from a year ago largely due to lower crude oil prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins,"" Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said. 
Wirth signalled that Chevron considers itself on track to make a deal for Anadarko. He said combining the shale, deepwater and liquefied natural gas businesses of the two companies ""will unlock significant value to shareholders."" 
Although earnings topped Wall Street's consensus, investors are focused on the takeover battle for Anadarko, wrote analysts at Edward Jones. The brokerage firm rates Chevron a buy.
""We would not be surprised to see Chevron raise its offer,"" they said in a research note on Friday, saying the company's bid will ""ultimately be the successful one."" 
Chevron's daily production of oil and gas rose to 3.04 billion of barrels, from 2.85 billions of barrels in the year-ago period. But the price for each barrel of U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids fell to $48 from $56 a year earlier. Chevron's take from international output, slipped to $58 per barrel from $61 a year earlier. 
The lower prices and weakness in gasoline margins knocked first-quarter net income to $2.65 billion, or $1.39 per share, from $3.64 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street consensus was $1.30 per share.
Revenue fell nearly 7 percent to $35.2 billion from $37.64 billion a year ago. 
Shares of San Ramona, California-based Chevron slipped less than 1 percent to $117.18 in morning trading. 
Rival  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Friday reported its earnings were well below analysts' estimates, citing the effects of weaker crude prices, heavier maintenance and weaker margins in its refining and chemicals businesses.
Exxon shares were off 2.4 percent at $80.25 in morning trading.

14,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",Goldman-Backed Firm May Be First Russian IPO in U.S. Since 2013,"(Bloomberg) -- HeadHunter Group PLC plans to raise as much as $253 million in what would be the first initial public offering of a Russian company in the U.S. since Washington began imposing sanctions in 2014 to punish the Kremlin for its role in the Ukrainian crisis.
HeadHunter, Russia’s largest online-recruitment firm, plans to offer up to 18.75 million American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq at between $11 and $13.50 a share, the company said in a statement Thursday. The shares will be sold by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Elbrus Capital, which acquired the company from Mail.ru Group Ltd. in 2016.
If it goes through, this will be the first time a Russian company tests the American market since 2013, when fintech firm Qiwi Plc and software developer Luxoft Holding Inc. sold shares. Geopolitical tensions following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and later charges of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election have led to escalating sanctions against Moscow and dampened investor appetite.
Goldman, which is managing the HeadHunter listing along with five other banks including  Morgan Stanley  & Co (NYSE:MS)., VTB Capital Plc and Sberbank CIB, may be seeking to take advantage of investor enthusiasm for the technology sector after offerings by  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., according to Alina Sychova, head of capital markets at Sova Capital in Moscow.
HeadHunter postponed plans for a U.S. offering last April following a new wave of sanctions that pummeled Russian markets, Kommersant reported at the time.
The market for Russian equity sales remains frail. Not a single Russian company held an initial public offering last year and Globaltruck Management was the last firm to list shares on the Moscow Exchange, in November 2017. Earlier this month, Russian railroad carrier Rustranscom PLC dropped plans for a London offering. Cherkizovo Group PJSC, which delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2017, shelved a potential share sale because it said the situation on capital markets wasn’t favorable.
“The banks managing the HeadHunter IPO also participated in marketing Rustranscom and Cherkizovo deals and understand the level of investor demand for Russia,” Sychova said. “It seems they are hoping U.S. demand for the technology sector will take this deal over the finish line.”"
15,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>","American to take $350 million hit from 737 MAX, sees ungrounding this summer","By Sanjana Shivdas and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc cut its 2019 profit forecast on Friday, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes, but said it was confident that the jets would start flying again before mid-August.
American, with 24 of the 737 MAX jetliners that were grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes on other airlines, has removed the aircraft from its fleet until Aug. 19, leading to about 115 daily cancellations.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is developing a software fix and new pilot training to be approved by regulators globally, and American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he had 95 percent certainty that passengers would actually be able to use tickets the airline sells on MAX flights past Aug. 19. 
While American's daily summer cancellations over the MAX only represent about 2 percent of its flight capacity, it said, the financial impact is disproportionate as revenue during its busy summer travel season is lost while the vast majority of costs remain in place.
As a result, Fort Worth, Texas-based American said it now expects its 2019 adjusted profit of $4.00 per share to $6.00 per share, from a previous forecast of between $5.50 per share and $7.50 per share.
Analysts on average expect 2019 earnings of $5.63 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares were down 2.3 percent at $32.64 in early trading.
American, the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, also said it expects fuel expenses for the year to be about $650 million higher than its earlier forecast, citing a recent run-up in oil prices.
The airline reported first-quarter net income of $185 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $159 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the airline earned 52 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 51 cents per share.
Between the MAX and American's grounding of another 14 aircraft of a different model for now-completed work on faulty overhead bins, American said, first quarter pre-tax income suffered about an $80 million hit. 
Total operating revenue rose 1.8 percent to $10.58 billion, marginally missing estimates of $10.60 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Still, Parker said demand remained strong heading into the summer. American expects unit revenue, a closely watched performance measure that compares sales with flight capacity, to rise between 1 percent and 3 percent in the second quarter.

OSLO/COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - SAS pilots in Norway, Sweden and Denmark went on strike on Friday as wage talks broke down, threatening the travel plans of some 170,000 passengers over the weekend.
The airline canceled around 70 percent of its flights on Friday and Saturday.
SAS is in the midst of renewing an aging fleet after spending years cutting costs in the face of competition from budget carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
At airports across Scandinavia stranded passengers were queuing at SAS counters to get help.
At Copenhagen Airport, Spanish teachers Juan Manuel Gonzalez and Miguel Angel, on a trip with 23 students to Chicago, had been re-booked on a flight on Saturday, but the delay was proving costly for their students.
""The kids had tickets for basketball and theaters tonight, so they won't be able to get a refund. It is a nightmare for them and they're in a very bad mood,"" Gonzalez said. 
On her way from the Faroe Islands to her home in Frankfurt, Astrid Melbert did not know when she would be able to leave Copenhagen.
""The last two times I've been traveling, I was hit by strikes, so I thought I would book with SAS this time. See how that went,"" she said.
Many flights at regional rival Norwegian Air were sold out on Friday with some ticket prices on its website soaring. A flight between Oslo and Stockholm cost 9,000 Swedish crowns ($948), several thousand more than might normally be expected.
TALKS ON HOLD
SAS, whose shares traded 5.3 percent lower in Stockholm on Friday, said it hoped to resume negotiations and reach an agreement with its pilots as soon as possible.
""As a consequence of the strike, domestic, European and long-haul flights have been canceled, and thousands of travelers will be affected,"" it said in a statement.
SAS said it was prepared to continue to negotiate, but that if the pilots' requirements were met, it would have ""very negative consequences"" for the company.
Analysts at Sydbank expect the strike to cost SAS 60-80 million Swedish crowns ($6.3-$8.4 million) per day, wiping out an expected net profit for the year if it lasts for two weeks.
""The SAS pilots' strike...makes it clear that SAS is more vulnerable than we previously expected,"" Sydbank analysts said.
In total, 1,409 pilots from a total of around 1,500 across the three countries went on strike on Friday. Flights operated by SAS partners, which make up approximately 30 percent of all departures, were not affected, the airline said.
""The strike could have been avoided, if SAS had shown a real willingness to meet us halfway,"" said Rene Arpe, chairman of the Danish pilot union.
The aviation industry's employer body in Sweden said pilots held onto their ""extreme wage claims"", demanding a 13 percent wage increase despite what it called already high average wages of 93,000 Swedish crowns ($9,759.89) a month.
The unions dispute the figure, saying salaries start at 34,000 SEK, increasing over 25 years to 98,000 for a captain. 
LABOR TENSION 
The SAS Pilot Group, a federation representing 95 percent of the airline's pilots in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, said in a statement it had tried to gain greater transparency about working hours. 
Most pilots don't have fixed schedules and in some situations risk working seven weekends in a row, the group said, adding that pilots were prepared for a ""prolonged"" strike.
Close to bankruptcy in 2012, SAS was forced to sell assets and cut wages and thousands of jobs in return for a life-saving credit facility. It has posted a net profit in each of the last four years.
But fuel costs are rising in line with crude prices and European airlines face continued overcapacity and currency volatility, factors that have toppled several smaller players in the past year.
Labor tensions have also risen in the past two years as the industry faces a global pilot shortage.

That has bolstered pilots' bargaining power, as seen at other airlines including Ryanair, Lufthansa and Air France.

Robert Carr, who founded Heartland, did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which was filed this week with the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut.
The SEC accused Carr of repeatedly discussing merger talks with his partner Katherine Hanratty and writing a check so Hanratty, who had expressed worries about her finances, could buy $900,000 of Heartland stock before the merger was announced.
Hanratty sold her stock for a $250,628 profit in April 2016, four months after Atlanta-based Global Payments agreed to buy its smaller rival, the SEC said.
The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill. He also will decide whether to ban Carr, who is in his mid-70s, from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
A lawyer for Carr did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Hanratty agreed last October to pay $528,608, including a $250,628 civil fine, to settle related SEC charges.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Shareholders approved Credit Suisse's 2018 compensation report with an 82 percent majority on Friday, overriding frustrations expressed at its annual general meeting over jumps in executive pay during a year its share price plummeted. 
Three shareholder advisers had recommended investors vote against the remuneration report at Switzerland's second-biggest bank, while a fourth backed the report but expressed reservations about whether management pay matched performance. 
""The divide between the compensation proposed today and the roughly 40 percent share price loss your bank recorded last year is untenable for these long-term investors,"" Vincent Kaufmann, head of proxy adviser Ethos, told board directors and executives.
Just out of a three-year restructuring,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said a 30 percent pay rise awarded executives in 2018 reflected a job well done, with the bank last year having turned its first annual profit since 2014, slashed costs and focused growth on managing wealth for private clients.
The 12-member executive board got a combined 93.5 million Swiss francs ($91.7 million) in 2018 fixed pay and incentives. Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam's compensation rose to 12.7 million francs.
Unrest over pay packets had moved senior management to take a voluntary 40 percent bonus cut two years ago after a 2.7 billion Swiss franc loss.
""We can be anything but satisfied with the development of our share price,"" Chairman Urs Rohner told investors. 
""That said, it needs to be borne in mind that our share price is not just influenced by our performance...At the heart of this problem lies the persistently low interest rate environment in Europe, which also makes European banking stocks less attractive than their U.S. counterparts.""
Credit Suisse shares have rebounded 27 percent in 2019 as the bank has pulled in fresh money and grown profitability during challenging quarters but -- at around 13.7 francs -- still trade at roughly half the level they did when Thiam took charge in 2015.
""Let's be clear: we all bought into Credit Suisse because we want to make money,"" one shareholder said. ""I was dumb enough to buy the stock when it was at 80 (francs),"" he said, adding he intended to sell it after the meeting's end.
Approval of group compensation has steadily increased over the last three years from 57.98 percent in 2017 and 80.8 percent in 2018.

At 9:48 AM ET (13:48 GMT), the Dow Jones fell 33 points, or 0.1%, at 26,429.40 points, the S&P 500 dropped 4 points, or 0.1%, to 2,922.27 points, while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 43 points, or 0.5%, to 8,075.66 points.
Putting pressure on the Dow, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged more than 8% after the company slashed its forecasts for the rest of the year on Thursday and reported its first quarterly drop in sales of data-center chips in seven years. It said sales had slowed “dramatically” in China against the backdrop of its trade dispute with the U.S.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) stock sank 2% after the oil major reported first-quarter earnings that missed estimates.
Rival  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) also saw shares drop 0.5% after reporting a 27% decline in first-quarter profit.
The string of disappointing earnings from Dow components on Friday follows a similar pattern seen a day earlier when industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) dampened bullish sentiment.
But the earnings season is not as dismal as these results from blue-chip companies may imply.
The reporting season is nearing the halfway mark, with 228 of the S&P 500 companies having released their first-quarter numbers. So far, 78% of those reporting have beaten profit estimates on growth of 6.9%, while 61% have topped consensus on sales thanks to 4% growth.
“Estimate cuts this earnings season are not nearly as bad as they were last quarter,” analysts from The Earnings Scout pointed out.
On the economic front, gross domestic product jumped 3.2% in the first quarter, according to government data released on Friday, defying expectations for what would have been the slowest expansion in two years.
Analysts remained cautious, however, pointing to temporary factors for the jump in growth.
“Taking out the over-sized boosts from net trade, inventories and highways investment, which will all be reversed in the coming quarters, growth was only around 1.0%,” Capital Economics analyst Paul Ashworth said.
Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM US, insisted that the numbers were not a game changer for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.
“Fed policymakers are going to look right past that 3.2% top-line number and focus on composition of growth, which will reaffirm its prudent pause. No rate hikes or cuts until after the 2020 election,” he said.
A Bloomberg poll of economists released ahead of the GDP release showed that consensus is in agreement with Brusuelas, with no moves expected in interest rates through 2020."

AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc has sued four Indian farmers for cultivating a potato variety that the snack food and drinks maker claims infringes its patent, the company and the growers said on Friday.
Pepsi has sued the farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, exclusively grown for its popular Lay's potato chips. The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips. 
PepsiCo is seeking more than 10 million rupees ($142,840.82) each for alleged patent infringement.
The farmers grow potatoes in the western state of Gujarat, a leading producer of India's most consumed vegetable.
""We have been growing potatoes for a long time and we didn't face this problem ever, as we've mostly been using the seeds saved from one harvest to plant the next year's crop,"" said Bipin Patel, one of the four farmers sued by Pepsi.
Patel did not say how he came by the PepsiCo variety.
A court in Ahmedabad, the business hub of Gujarat, on Friday agreed to hear the case on June 12, said Anand Yagnik, the lawyer for the farmers.
""In this instance, we took judicial recourse against people who were illegally dealing in our registered variety,"" A PepsiCo India spokesman said. ""This was done to protect our rights and safeguard the larger interest of farmers that are engaged with us and who are using and benefiting from seeds of our registered variety.""
PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 potato variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to the company at a fixed price. 
The All India Kisan Sabha, or All India Farmers' Forum, has asked the Indian government to protect the farmers.
The farmers' forum has also called for a boycott of PepsiCo's Lay's chips and the company's other products.
The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
PepsiCo is the second major U.S. company in India to face issues over patent infringement.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>",Activist investor Bramson may get bloody nose at Barclays AGM,"By Simon Jessop and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Edward Bramson is likely to fail in his attempt to get a board seat at Barclays' annual meeting next week, even though shareholders are dissatisfied with performance of the group's investment bank. 
New York-based Bramson's Sherborne Investors and the board of the British bank have been sparring for months over Barclays' strategy.
Bramson wants to scale back Barclays' investment bank to reduce risk and boost shareholder returns.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley remains staunchly committed to growing the business out of trouble. 
After failing to persuade Staley to change course since he began building a 5.5 percent stake in the bank in March last year, Bramson hopes a board seat will rachet up the pressure. 
Both sides have written to shareholders pitching their case and Bramson has courted investors in one-on-one meetings, although none have publicly backed him yet. 
Interviews by Reuters with five institutional investors in Barclays suggest Bramson has failed to persuade them. 
Sherborne declined to comment. 
Mirza Baig, head of investment stewardship at top-40 shareholder  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, said Bramson was welcome on the bank's register but the boardroom was a step too far.
""He has created a lot of value at other businesses, but, generally, when he has come in as executive chair and taken full control. This would be a different case where he would just be one lone voice on the board,"" he said. 
A second Barclays shareholder said he backed Bramson's goal of improving returns but via an ""evolutionary"" approach. 
""If you look at banks that have tried to restructure their operations in investment banking - you look at Natwest Markets,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) - I struggle to think of an example where a roughshod restructuring has been accretive to shareholder value."" 
A third, top-30 investor said he had been impressed by incoming Chairman Nigel Higgins' grasp of the challenge in hand, and felt investors would give him time.
""Management know they have to execute and deliver improved returns... [Higgins] will continue to re-shape the board but obviously he didn't feel that having someone with a diametrically opposed view on it would be helpful.""
A fourth, top-30 investor agreed: ""We voted for the chairman to come in and it would be crazy to allow an activist to join the board (at this time).""
Jupiter Fund Management, the 24th largest investor, said it also planned to vote against Bramson.
Barclays has nearly 500 institutional shareholders, Refinitiv data showed.
Since Staley joined Barclays in 2015, the investment bank returns relative to capital invested have increased but are still underperforming the overall business. 
Barclays' first-quarter figures showed the investment bank posted a 6 percent drop in income from its markets business and a 17 percent fall in banking advisory fees.
Returns in the investment bank fell to 9.5 percent from 13.2 percent a year ago.
Famed for successful campaigns against smaller British companies in sectors from chemicals to advertising, Bramson's board seat pitch has been rebuffed by shareholder advisory firms.
Institutional Shareholder Services, the world's biggest, said Bramson's proposal ""falls short of what can reasonably be expected from a shareholder trying to address issues at a 28 billion pounds, systemically important bank"".
Glass Lewis also flagged concern about Bramson's lack of banking experience and ""questionable"" shareholding structure, referring to Sherborne's use of derivative contracts to hedge losses should its strategy fail.
Critics said the arrangement meant his interests are not truly aligned with those of other long-term shareholders. 

British advisory firm Pirc, however, said it recommended that investors abstain in the vote on Bramson's proposal as a challenge to the board to do better in the year ahead - or face a similar contest in 2020.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Britain must get to the bottom of the leak of confidential discussions during a top-level security meeting about the role of China's Huawei Technologies in 5G network supply chains, British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday.
News that Britain's National Security Council, attended by senior ministers and spy chiefs, had agreed on Tuesday to bar Huawei from all core parts of the country's 5G network and restrict its access to non-core elements was leaked to a national newspaper.
The leak of secret discussions has sparked anger in parliament and amongst Britain's intelligence community. Britain's most senior civil servant Mark Sedwill has launched an inquiry and written to ministers who were at the meeting.
""My understanding from London (is) that an investigation has been announced into apparent leaks from the NSC meeting earlier this week,"" said Hammond, speaking on the sidelines of a summit on China's Belt and Road initiative in Beijing. 
""To my knowledge there has never been a leak from a National Security Council meeting before and therefore I think it is very important that we get to the bottom of what happened here,"" he told Reuters in a pooled interview. 
British culture minister Jeremy Wright said on Thursday he could not rule out a criminal investigation. The majority of the ministers at the NSC meeting have said they were not involved, according to media reports.
Hammond said he was unaware of any previous leak from a meeting of the NSC. 
""It’s not about the substance of what was apparently leaked. It's not earth-shattering information. But it is important that we protect the principle that nothing that goes on in national security council meetings must ever be repeated outside the room.""
Allowing Huawei a reduced role in building its 5G network puts Britain at odds with the United States which has told allies not to use its technology at all because of fears it could be a vehicle for Chinese spying. Huawei has categorically denied this.
There have been concerns that the NSC's conclusion, which sources confirmed to Reuters, could upset other allies in the world's leading intelligence-sharing network - the Five Eyes alliance of the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
However, British ministers and intelligence officials have said any final decision on 5G would not put critical national infrastructure at risk. Ciaran Martin, head of the cyber center of Britain's main eavesdropping agency, GCHQ, played down any threat of a rift in the Five Eyes alliance.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",Renault to propose joint holding company with Nissan: Nikkei,"TOKYO (Reuters) -  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) will propose to Nissan Motor Co a plan to create a joint holding company which would give both firms equal footing as the French automaker seeks further integration with its Japanese partner, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.
Under the proposal, both firms would nominate a nearly equal number of directors to the new company in which ordinary shares in both Nissan and Renault would be transferred on a balanced basis, the newspaper said, without citing sources. 
This would effectively dilute the stake held by the French government in Renault to around 7-8 percent, from its current 15 percent, it added. The new company would be headquartered in a third country, such as Singapore.
Renault plans to make the proposal to Nissan soon, the Nikkei said, having modified an earlier merger idea which Nissan rejected on April 12.
Nissan declined to comment on the issue. The Financial Times newspaper reported that both Nissan and the Japanese government have refused to engage in merger talks with Renault. 
The report of the proposal comes as the outlook for the alliance - one of the world's top automaking partnerships - has clouded since the arrest in November of its main architect, Carlos Ghosn, for suspected financial misconduct.
It also comes as Nissan's financial performance struggles following years of focusing on volume sales over building its brand, particularly in the United States, its biggest market. 
FORECAST SLASHED
This week, the Japanese automaker slashed its profit forecast for the year just ended to its lowest in nearly a decade, citing weakness in its U.S. operations.
Renault for years has been vying for a closer merger with Nissan, which it rescued from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago. Ghosn had been working to achieve a deeper integration before his arrest on financial misconduct charges in November last year. 
While the automakers have been consolidating many of their operations over the past decade, including procurement and production, many executives at Nissan have opposed an all-out merger with Renault.
Instead, Nissan has argued for a more equal footing with Renault, which holds a 43 percent stake in its bigger partner. Nissan holds a 15 percent stake in Renault.
It was unclear whether Renault would hold the casting vote in major decisions at the new company, as it did in Renault-Nissan B.V., a strategic management company jointly held by both companies which oversaw operations for the partnership. 
That company was disbanded last month after an internal investigation by Nissan following Ghosn's arrest indicated that the company may have been involved with financial misconduct by the former chairman.

Nissan's partnership with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, in which it holds a 34 percent stake, would remain unchanged under the new proposal, the Nikkei said.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>","Dollar off two-year highs ahead of U.S. GDP, shares subdued","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slipped from 23-month highs on Friday ahead of keenly awaited U.S. gross domestic product data for the first quarter, while global shares were on track for a fifth successive weekly gain despite subdued trade.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was down 0.06 percent on the day, off a nearly two-year high hit on the previous day. 
The U.S. currency has gained strongly over the past few days as investors expect the U.S. economy to outperform the rest of the developed world. The dollar index is set to end the week 0.7 percent higher. 
The other big mover in currencies was the Japanese yen, which gained as speculators cut short positions ahead of holidays which will see most Japanese markets shut for six whole trading days.
Global stocks were largely flat on the day after subdued trading in Asia. MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat but set for its fifth weekly gain on the trot.
Most major European bourses opened lower, but turned around by midday trade in London. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE was down 0.2 percent. Futures markets indicated a lower open on Wall Street.
All eyes were on the U.S. GDP release which will be closely watched after a string of largely resilient data from an economy in its 10th year of expansion. The data will be out at 1230 GMT.
A string of solid numbers has led analysts to revise up their forecasts for growth and the latest median polled by Reuters is for an annualized 2.0 percent.
The closely-watched estimate of GDP from the Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting an outcome of 2.7 percent, a huge turnaround from a few weeks ago when it was at 0.5 percent.
""Today's GDP print in the U.S. has become even more important given the recent move higher in the dollar,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP. 
""The dollar’s strength is beginning to gain investor attention and has led to vulnerable emerging markets such as Argentina and Turkey appearing exposed once again, whilst it also seems to be a headwind for U.S. risk markets in which momentum is stalling, despite decent Q1 earnings thus far.""
TIGHTENING AT AN END?
The GDP release also sets the stage for a Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, where investors will try to anticipate how the U.S. central bank will react to mostly resilient indicators of late. 
Yet the rebound has not been mirrored in inflation, which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish.
Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada have backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year. 
European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos on Thursday opened the door to more money-printing if needed to boost inflation in the euro zone.
Rate cuts look much likelier in Australia and New Zealand after recent disappointingly weak inflation reports.
The Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting next week and is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts published on Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether. 
Major depreciate when the global economy improves and also when global investors become more risk-averse,"" said UBS strategists in central banks are done tightening policy, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters, with the growth outlook wilting across developed and emerging economies along with scant prospects for a surge in inflation.
""We think the dollar is likely to a research note, in a break with what they said was the dollar's traditional outperformance when the U.S. economy outperforms its peers or when global risk aversion drives investors to the safety of U.S. assets.
Reasons they cited were the Fed having more room to cut rates than its global peers and an acceleration in global growth that might allow those peers to tighten policy, thereby closing the interest rate gap.
""Only a benign environment where global central banks tread water and yield differentials remain static (i.e. the status quo) would be U.S. dollar-supportive."" 
Elsewhere in currencies, the euro was off 1 percent for the week as euro zone economic figures continued to disappoint, though it was 0.04 percent higher on the day at $1.1135.
In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.3 percent firmer at $1,280.48 per ounce.

Oil prices fell on Friday as the market retreated slightly from its strongest bull run in at least a year amid efforts to resume Russian oil flows that were interrupted by contamination.

(Reuters) - Debenhams plans to close 22 stores next year, putting about 1,200 jobs at risk, under a scheme designed to put the ailing British retailer on a stable financial footing.
Debenhams' lenders took control of the retailer earlier this month in an effort to keep stores open, a deal which wiped out the company's shareholders, including  Sports Direct  (LON:SPD) boss Mike Ashley, who had tried to take control of the business.
The retailer on Friday gave details of two proposed company voluntary arrangements which would keep all stores open during 2019, but with 22 closures planned for next year. 
Once the country's biggest department store chain, Debenhams has been hit by a sharp slowdown in sales, high rents and ballooning debt, plus a power struggle with billionaire shareholder Ashley's Sports Direct.
Administrators were appointed after Ashley's last-ditch bid to rescue the company failed. They sold the group to its creditors including British banks and U.S. hedge funds.
CVAs allow retailers to avoid insolvency by offloading unwanted stores and securing lower rents on others and reach a compromise with creditors. They have been adopted by other British retailers including fashion chain New Look.
""In order for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the group's store portfolio and its balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today's much changed retail environment,"" Debenhams Executive Chairman Terry Duddy said.
""Our priority is to save as many stores and as many jobs as we can, while making the business fit for the future.""
Debenhams said some of its financial creditors recently provided 200 million pounds ($258.06 million) of fresh liquidity and have committed to converting 100 million pounds of debt to equity.
Debenhams net debt stood at 417.4 million pounds as at March 2. 
The CVAs ultimately aim to reduce Debenhams' current 166 UK store portfolio by closing about 50 stores, the first stage of which proposes 22 closures in 2020.
The retailer separately reported a 36.3 percent fall in core earnings before exceptional items to 65.9 million pounds for the 26 weeks to March 2, hurt by a dip in sales and falling margins.
In business since 1778, Debenhams has been battling for survival after a consumer shift online and to cheaper outlets left it with too much retail space on struggling high streets.
The company could close more stores over five years, the final number being dependent on its performance, the retailer said. Debenhams said it would try to redeploy as many affected staff as possible.
Creditors will vote on the CVAs on May 9.

(Reuters) - Deloitte quit as Ferrexpo's auditor on Friday, knocking its shares by more than 20 percent, days after saying it was unable to conclude whether the iron ore miner's CEO controlled a charity being investigated over its use of company donations.
Blooming Land, which coordinates Ferrexpo's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, came under scrutiny after auditors found holes in the charity's statements.
Ferrexpo on Tuesday said findings of an ongoing independent investigation launched in February indicated some Blooming Land funds could have been ""misappropriated"". It did not provide any details or publish its findings.
Shares in Ferrexpo, the third largest exporter of pellets to the global steel industry, were 23.4 percent lower at 206.1 pence at 1022 GMT following news of Deloitte's resignation.
""Ferrexpo's shares are deeply discounted vs peers ... following the resignation of Deloitte, we expect downside risks to dominate Ferrexpo's shares near term."" JP Morgan analyst Dominic O'Kane said in a note on Friday.
Swiss-headquartered Ferrexpo did not provide a reason for the resignation of Deloitte, which declined to comment, while Blooming Land did not respond to a request for comment.
Funding for Blooming Land's CSR activities is provided by one of Ferrexpo's units in Ukraine and Khimreaktiv LLC, an entity ultimately controlled by Ferrexpo's CEO and majority owner Kostyantin Zhevago, Ferrexpo said on Tuesday.
Ferrexpo's board has found that Zhevago did not have significant influence or control over the charity, but Deloitte said it was unable reach a conclusion on this.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact Zhevago. 
In a qualified opinion, a statement addressing an incomplete audit, Deloitte said it had been unable to conclude whether $33.5 million of CSR donations to Blooming Land between 2017 and 2018 was used for ""legitimate business payments for charitable purposes"".
Deloitte said on Tuesday that total CSR payments made to Blooming Land by Ferrexpo since 2013 total about $110 million.
Ferrexpo, whose major mines are in Ukraine, has said that the investigation was ongoing and new evidence pointed to potential discrepancies.

Zhevago, 45, who ranked 1,511 on Forbes magazine's list of billionaires for 2019 with a net worth of $1.4 billion, owns the FC Vorskla soccer club and has been a member of Ukraine's parliament since 1998.

38,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>",Stocks - Futures Mixed Ahead of 1Q GDP Report; Crude Oil Dips,"Investing.com -- Wall Street is set for a cautious opening on Friday ahead of the release of first-quarter data on economic growth that could push the market in either direction.
Consensus forecasts suggest an annualized growth rate of 2.0%, down from 2.2% in the final quarter of 2018 and the slowest rate in two years. However, the risks seem to the upside after a spate of relatively strong economic data in recent weeks, notably from the retail and construction sectors.
“Figures don’t lie,” said Mark Dowding, co-head of developed markets at BlueBay Asset Management. “The U.S. economy looks rosy, while Europe is showing weak growth and emerging markets are being shaken by problems in Turkey and Argentina.”
At 6:30 AM ET (10:30 GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures was down 23.5 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures was off 1.3 points, effectively unchanged, while the Nasdaq 100 futures was up 14 points, or 0.2%.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was at 97.877, hovering just below the two-year high it hit on Thursday.
Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) seemed set for the strongest opening, rising 8.7% in premarket trade after a stellar first-quarter report on Thursday that stood in stark contrast to the gloom coming out of much of the auto industry overnight, including from Germany's Daimler (OTC:DMLRY) and France's Renault (OTC:RNLSY).
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was poised to open higher after reporting a new record profit in the first quarter  after the bell on Thursday – albeit gains seemed likely to be modest, given that revenue growth slowed further and the company forecast higher operating costs in the second half as it rolls out one-day shopping globally.
By contrast, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares were indicated down over 7% after the company slashed its forecasts for the rest of the year on Thursday and reported a first quarterly drop in sales of data-center chips in seven years. It said sales had slowed “dramatically” in China against the backdrop of its trade dispute with the U.S.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures fell after spiking on Thursday due to problems with Russian oil supplies to Europe. The country’s largest pipeline had to be closed, cutting around 1 million barrels a day from supplies to Poland and Germany, after the operator Transneft discovered chemical contamination in the oil.
The benchmark WTI futures contract was down 1.6% at $64.14 a barrel – a drop of more than two dollars from the 2019 high it hit on Wednesday. Brent futures were down 1.9% at $72.95 a barrel.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc beat first-quarter sales and earnings expectations on Friday as the British drugmaker benefited from a push into cancer drugs and emerging markets including China.
Newer treatments such as lung cancer drug Tagrisso, now the company's top selling medicine, have helped the drugmaker's return to growth after years of crumbling sales due to patent losses on older drugs. 
Sales in China have shown explosive growth, more than doubling since 2012, but AstraZeneca executives on Friday said that may not be sustained. 
""The enormous growth you currently see in China, 28 percent, probably is not sustainable, but we feel very bullish that the growth will continue to be at a pace of between 15 percent and 20 percent,"" Ruud Dobber, executive vice president, BioPharma, told Reuters. 
Shares of the company were down 0.2 percent at 5,878 pence at 1031 GMT. 
The turnaround in AstraZeneca's fortunes has been powered by a push into cancer treatments led by Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who saw off a 2014 takeover bid from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in part by promising annual sales of $45 billion by 2023. 
In the first quarter, sales from its oncology unit rose 59 percent to $1.89 billion, accounting for 35 percent of total product sales. 
The company has moved deeper into cancer therapy market through wide-ranging deals, including those for immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Last month, it agreed a multi-billion dollar oncology deal with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd.

""We're reaching that point where after years of having to keep faith, we have actually got something tangible to believe in,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said. 
AstraZeneca also backed its annual sales and earnings forecast and said it has extensively prepared for UK's anticipated exit from the European Union, even in the event of a no-deal exit. 
The company has already spent more than 40 million pounds ($52 million) on Brexit preparations, including stockpiling six weeks' worth of drugs in the UK and four weeks in continental Europe to guard against shortages.
AstraZeneca said product sales rose 14 percent at constant currency to $5.47 billion in the quarter, led by its lung cancer drug Tagrisso and respiratory treatment Pulmicort.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 06:28AM ET</span>",Ad group WPP hit by client losses in North America,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest advertising company WPP (LON:WPP) suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter underlying sales in North America as the loss of work from clients such as Ford took a toll on its most important market. 
WPP, led by company veteran Mark Read following last year's departure of founder Martin Sorrell, said its U.S. performance was disappointing but in line with expectations. 
The company's shares, which fell by more than 50 percent between a peak in March 2017 and the end of 2018 before stabilizing this year, rose 3 percent in mid-morning trading after it reiterated its full-year forecasts. 
WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and the turmoil linked to Sorrell's abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.
With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.
First-quarter results showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018. 
Read has said the group failed to invest enough in recent years in the United States, where its business was also hit by big account losses from AT&T (NYSE:T) and VW in 2016. 
Its U.S. sales fell by 4.2 percent in 2018 and were down 8.5 percent in the first quarter of 2019. 
The weak performance in the world's biggest advertising market has meant WPP has fallen behind its nearest rivals in terms of growth, with U.S. groups Omnicom and IPG performing more strongly. 
NO QUICK ANSWERS
Read said around three quarters of its businesses in North America has a different leadership from six months ago. 
""It's not going to be quick,"" he told Reuters. ""It takes time for people to have an impact on the business and on clients. (But) we've dealt with the losses. There is much less business under review than there was this time last year.""
Overall, WPP reported a drop in its main sales measurement of organic revenue less pass through costs of 2.8 percent. It reiterated its full-year forecast of a fall of 1.5 to 2 percent.
Read, a softly spoken executive who had worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to steer the company back to growth.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>","European shares weak as banks, Glencore weigh; U.S. GDP in focus","By Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh
(Reuters) - European shares slipped on Friday after losses in heavyweight banks and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) outweighed gains in healthcare and auto stocks, while investors remained on the sidelines ahead of U.S. economic data for the first quarter.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0935 GMT, eyeing a modest loss at the end of a holiday-shortened week. Banks-heavy Italian and Spanish indices were laggards.
The banking index fell for a fourth day, at the end of a heavy earnings week for lenders. 
Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) tumbled after posting lower first quarter profit, hurt by intensifying competition and Brexit uncertainty, while its investment bank also registered poor returns.
Weakness in investment banking also dented Deutsche Bank's quarterly trading revenue and sent its shares lower a day after the German bank abandoned merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""The current interest rate environment makes it challenging for banks to make proper earnings because of their intermediary function,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist eurozone, at Rabobank.
Since the start of April, all country indexes were on pace to rise between 1.8 percent and 3.4 percent, their fourth month of gains, while Germany was strongly outperforming with 6 percent growth.
""For now the current sentiment is very cautious as markets wait for the first estimates of the U.S. GDP growth which could see a surprise,"" Mevissen said.
U.S. economic data for the first-quarter is due at 1230 GMT. Growth worries outside the United States resurfaced this week after South Korea's economy unexpectedly contracted at the start of the year and weak German business sentiment data for April also disappointed.
Among the biggest drags on the benchmark index in Europe were the basic resources sector and the oil and gas sector, weighed down by Britain's Glencore and France's Total, respectively.
Glencore dropped after reports that U.S authorities were investigating whether the company and its subsidiaries violated certain provisions of the commodity exchange act.
Energy major Total said its net profit for the first three months of the year fell compared with a year ago due to volatile oil prices and debt costs.
Chip stocks in the region including Siltronic, Ams and STMicroelectronics lost more than 1 percent after  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) reduced its full-year revenue forecast, adding to concerns that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019.
Meanwhile, healthcare, which is also seen as a defensive sector, was a bright spot. It was helped by French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) after it returned to growth with higher profits and revenues for the first-quarter.
Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES led media stocks higher after it maintained its full-year outlook on the back of the company's Networks division.
Automakers in the region rose 0.4 percent, led by Valeo's 6 percent jump as the French parts maker said its performance would improve in the second half of the year. 
 Continental AG  (DE:CONG) advanced after it backed its outlook for the year despite reporting a fall in first-quarter earnings.

 Renault  (PA:RENA) rose more than 3 percent as it clung to full-year targets and pursues merger talks with its Japanese partner Nissan.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese equities sucked in their biggest inflows of cash this week since March 2018 ahead of the Bank of Japan's pledge to keep interest rates at super-low levels for longer - the latest central bank to commit to ultra-loose policy.
Investors plowed $5.4 billion into Japanese equity funds in the week to April 24, BAML strategists said on Friday, citing data from EPFR.
That came before the Japanese central bank on Thursday put a time frame on its forward guidance for the first time, telling investors that it would keep interest rates at super-low levels for at least one more year.
""Flows continue to reflect rising investor conviction that central banks will never raise rates again,"" strategists at the U.S. bank said in the note.
A rally across European and U.S. stocks this year has in part been fueled by big about-turns by the increasingly dovish European Central Bank and Federal Reserve on interest rates.
The big move into Japanese stocks also came as the Nikkei hit one-year highs ahead of an unprecedented holiday in Japan, with markets shut for six trading days from April 29 to celebrate its new emperor taking the throne.
Global bond funds received inflows of $9.9 billion in the week to April 24, with $4.4 billion leaving global equities, the sixth week of outflows, BAML said.
Cash continued to leave U.S. and European equities, with $6.4 billion flowing out of the United States and another $1.9 billion out of Europe. Emerging markets saw $900 million in outflows.
Investors were seeking to capture growth through $1.3 billion of investments in the technology sector and $800 million in healthcare. That move was at the expense of ""value"" sectors like financial services and energy, the bank added.
Elsewhere, government bonds saw the largest inflows in three months with $1.9 billion invested in the asset class, while high yield and emerging markets debt funds had their first outflows since Jan. 2.

Debt and currency positions in emerging markets were very crowded, with $250 billion flowing into emerging market debt and equity since February 2016, it said, adding that the current financial problems in Argentina and Turkey were the first signs of U.S. dollar pressures raising the risk of contagion in emerging markets.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The grounding of India's Jet Airways is turning into a quick windfall and long-term opportunity for international airlines keen to scoop up nearly a million outbound passengers from what was once the nation's biggest airline.
Jet, which previously had a fleet of around 120 largely Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co planes, was forced to indefinitely halt all flight operations on April 17 after its banks rejected the carrier's plea for emergency funds. 
The carrier's descent into crisis has benefited international airlines in the form of rising fares and demand, data showed.
Fares from India to cities such as Dubai, London, New York, Singapore and Bali in the first quarter of 2019 rose between 4 percent and 32 percent from a year ago, according to Indian travel portal MakeMyTrip Ltd.
In the peak travel months of May and June, fares to London have spiked as much as 36 percent and tickets to San Francisco are up nearly 20 percent from a year ago, according to data from travel portal Yatra.com. 
""For the next three months it's actually bonanza time for international players,"" said Ashish Nainan, a research analyst at CARE Ratings. ""At least until the middle of June, the fares are not going to come down.""
Due to rising demand, even before Jet's lessors grounded planes, carriers such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd and United Airlines saw an up to a 27 percent increase in passenger numbers from India in the last quarter of 2018, data from India's aviation regulator showed. That is the latest period for which the data is available.
India is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, clocking 15-20 percent domestic growth in recent years. It has long had only two full-service long-haul carriers, state-run Air India and Jet.
Jet is now hoping to be bailed out by a new investor, with final bids due on May 10. 
INCREASING CAPACITY
Before its grounding, Jet had the biggest share of India's outbound international air traffic, carrying 12 percent of the 7.8 million passengers headed overseas in the Oct-Dec quarter, down from 14 percent a year earlier, data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation showed. The total number of passengers traveling overseas with Jet fell 10 percent during the last quarter of 2018 even as the outbound travel market grew about 5 percent. 
Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines posted a 27 percent increase in passengers from India, Cathay registered 17 percent growth and British Airways saw a 10 percent rise in the same period.
Cathay said the events at Jet combined with increasing demand for travel had led it to deploy larger aircraft with more seats on some Indian routes.
""In the long term we would certainly like to be able to offer more capacity into India, not just on our existing routes but by establishing new services to secondary cities,"" Cathay said in a statement.
Singapore Airlines, in an email to Reuters, said the Indian market is ""very promising"" but declined to give details of airfare levels or demand patterns in the wake of Jet's exit, citing a quiet period before the release of its annual results.
DOMESTIC GAINS 
Jet's grounding has also had a big impact on the domestic market, with inter-city air fares to major cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata soaring more than 20 percent in May and June, according to Yatra.com. 
The spike in fares is expected to underpin strong earnings for IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd, which are set to report results for the quarter ended March 31 in the coming weeks.
""Domestic Indian carriers are the main benefactors, but I suspect if Jet fails to be revived by May 10 then Vistara and other airlines that ply international routes, particularly the lucrative Gulf market, are the main winners,"" said Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. Vistara is a joint venture of India's Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines.
Inadequate bilateral traffic rights between India and other countries, however, could be an impediment to foreign carriers' hopes of winning business lost by Jet, some analysts said.
""Even before Jet's operational shutdown, international capacity was significantly constrained,"" said Kapil Kaul, CEO for South Asia of consultancy CAPA. ""We have now more serious capacity challenge ... this is unlikely to be stabilized in the near term.""
A new national government likely to be in place sometime after elections end in May is expected to address the international capacity constraints, and once bilateral agreements are eased airlines including Emirates, Turkish and Qatar would immediately benefit, said Kaul. 

""We would love to add more flights but we are at the limit of the allocation granted to us for traffic rights,"" Emirates Chief Commercial Officer Thierry Antinori told reporters in Dubai on Wednesday.

Oh Lord, won’t somebody buy a Mercedes-Benz?
The troubles affecting Europe’s automakers are on full display Friday, as both Mercedes parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and France’s  Renault  (PA:RENA) reported falling sales in the first quarter.
The German company sold 7% fewer vehicles in the first quarter than it did a year earlier, with declines in all three of its most important regions – China (3%), Europe (4%) and the U.S. (9%). Earnings before interest and tax slid 16% although, at 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion), they still beat consensus forecasts by nearly 10%.
Even though outgoing Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche reaffirmed the company’s full-year outlook, the company’s shares were still down 0.3% on the news. That was lagging the local Dax index, which was broadly unchanged.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was also flat, losing 0.12 points – less than 0.1% to 390.02. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.
Daimler is facing a steep rise in investment obligations as it migrates to electric vehicles, along with its German peers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG). The three are all facing the prospect of fines from the European Commission for colluding to keep sub-optimal diesel engines on the road when they had better technology available to deploy.
Renault has problems of a slightly different nature, most obviously in the enormous distraction created by the criminal charges against its long-time CEO Carlos Ghosn. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Friday that the French company is preparing to propose a merger with Nissan, its Japanese partner, hoping to restore a relationship that has been badly strained by the Ghosn affair.
Renault's greater exposure to emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina has hurt it in recent months, and like its European rivals it has had to abandon hopes of making money in Iran in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to tighten sanctions on the country.
Renault’s sales were down 5.6%, although it eked out a 2% gain in Europe, its most important market. As a result, its shares outperformed the local CAC 40 index, rising 1.7%.
Europe’s other carmakers such as Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) have also reported weak first quarters."

Shares of the FTSE 100 company, which have lagged other mining heavyweights this year, fell as much as 4.2 percent in early trading, and were down 3.6 percent at 309.85 pence by 0807 GMT.
After the markets shut on Thursday, Glencore said the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating whether the company and its units have violated some provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and/or CFTC Regulations.
Glencore added that the investigations had a similar scope in terms of subject matter as the ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Last July, U.S. authorities demanded Glencore hand over documents about its business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria as part of a corruption probe.
""The CFTC investigation just reminds the market of the outstanding investigation once more and to have two sets of eyes on you must be uncomfortable,"" Grant Sporre, an associate director at Macquarie said.
Sporre, however, noted it was unlikely to be a double penalty in terms of a sanction.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said the CFTC fine could be ""in the $10 millions"".
""Until the impact of regulatory risks on potential liabilities, plus Glencore's business model, can be quantified, it remains difficult to assess Glencore's investment proposition,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote, maintaining its ""Neutral"" rating.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",Bayer shareholders vent ire over Monsanto-linked stock rout,"By Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger
BONN (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) shareholders vented their anger over its stock price slump on Friday as litigation risks mount from the German drugmaker's $63 billion takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
Several large investors said they will not support aspirin investor Bayer's management in a key vote scheduled for the end of its annual general meeting.
Bayer's management, led by chief executive Werner Baumann, could see an embarrassing plunge in approval ratings, down from 97 percent at last year's AGM, which was held shortly before the Monsanto takeover closed in June.
A vote to ratify the board's actions features prominently at every German AGM. Although it has no bearing on management's liability, it is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment.
""Due to the continued negative development at Bayer, high legal risks and a massive share price slump, we refuse to ratify the management board and supervisory board's actions during the business year,"" Janne Werning, representing Germany's Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder, said in prepared remarks.
About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found the pesticide and drugs group liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup.
Bayer suffered a similar defeat last month and more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.
Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the verdicts.
Deutsche Bank's asset managing arm DWS said shareholders should have been consulted before the takeover, which was agreed in 2016 and closed in June last year.
""You are pointing out that the lawsuits have not been lost yet. We and our customers, however, have already lost something - money and trust,"" Nicolas Huber, head of corporate governance at DWS, said in prepared remarks for the AGM.
He said DWS would abstain from the shareholder vote of confidence in the executive and non-executive boards.
Two people familiar with the situation told Reuters this week that Bayer's largest shareholder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board's actions.
Asset management firm Deka, among Bayer's largest German investors, has also said it would cast a no vote. 
Baumann said Bayer's true value was not reflected in the current share price.
""There's no way to make this look good. The lawsuits and the first verdicts weigh heavily on our company and it's a concern for many people,"" he said, adding it was the right decision to buy Monsanto and that Bayer was vigorously defending itself.

This month, shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 02:58AM ET</span>",Battle for Hong Kong Airlines pulls complex HNA holdings into daylight,"By Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shareholders summoned by Hong Kong Airlines this month for a meeting were greeted with some shocking news: the airline needed at least HK$2 billion in fresh funds or it would lose its operating license.
The carrier had lost HK$3 billion ($382.54 million) in 2018, they were told, and an infusion was crucial, according to people present. 
Dialed in, but silent for the hour-long meeting on April 1, were executives for Hainan-based HNA Group,, which holds 29 percent of the airline's shares.
Investors were blunt about HNA's role in the company's troubles, according to people at the meeting - including accusations that it was siphoning off cash, which the conglomerate denies. 
""There's no point raising fresh capital if we cannot solve the problem of (a) major shareholder pumping out HKA's assets,"" said Zhong Guosong, who holds 27 percent of the shares and is vying for chairmanship of the company.
Another shareholder echoed his views: ""This is Hong Kong, not Hainan.""
In the last week, drama from the call has spilled into the open as HNA and a rival group battled for control of Hong Kong Airlines' chairmanship. The airline declined to comment on shareholders' activities and said its operations ""remain normal.""
The infighting illustrates the convoluted nature of HNA's holdings around the world, which range from real estate to banks and are often divided among opaque, related entities. 
On paper, HNA gave up control of Hong Kong Airlines two years ago just as it began selling off assets collected in a $50 billion worldwide acquisition spree.
But the carrier has close ties with several HNA affiliates.
""HNA's shareholding structure and how they structure investments has always been very complicated, and the HKA case isn't any different,"" said David Yu, adjunct professor of finance at New York University, Shanghai. ""The issue now is that there is some distress at the parent group, and this is obviously having implications on the underlying companies, including HKA.""
HNA TANGLE
Since Beijing in 2017 began cracking down on Chinese conglomerates' rapid debt-fuelled global expansions, HNA has sold about $26 billion in assets, according to Dealogic data and Reuters calculations. 
Disposals include control of the Radisson hotel group; a quarter stake in Hilton Hotels; prime property in New York, Sydney, Shanghai, San Francisco and Hong Kong; regional Chinese airlines; a stake in aircraft lessor Avolon; and half of its stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
But the prices HNA has sought and the complex structures, loans and other business links that bind its holdings have made unwinding its investments difficult. 
HNA's wider Hong Kong interests are a case in point. This week, HNA-controlled CWT International said lenders had seized assets, including U.S. property and its Singapore-based commodity trading and logistics unit, because it failed to repay a HK$1.4 billion ($178 million) loan. 
HNA said that it was monitoring the situation, but that it was a matter for CWT and its creditors. Yet HNA units own 51 percent of CWT's shares, and each of CWT's executive directors has ties to other HNA businesses. CWT's co-chairman, Mung Kin Keung, is a shareholder in Hong Kong Airlines. 
HNA's involvement with the airline is just as complicated. The conglomerate took control of CR Airways in 2006 and renamed it Hong Kong Airlines. In July 2017 it cut its stake, according to filings, by selling 34 percent to Chinese private equity group Frontier Investment Partners.
According to Hong Kong Airlines' 2017 accounts, seen by Reuters, the airline held shares in four unlisted HNA affiliates, worth $367 million at the end of 2017, and had loaned $300 million to two other HNA firms.
That year, the airline's trade receivables - money owed to it but not collected - jumped 50 percent even as revenue rose only 11 percent. Of those payments due, the amount HNA companies owed the airline more than doubled to HK$1.3 billion, or 73 percent of receivables.
Zhong is closely linked with HNA as well, having been a director of the airline for almost four years until August 2018. Since 2017, he has also been chairman of Hong Kong Express, Hong Kong Airlines' low-cost sister, which HNA recently agreed to sell to Cathay Pacific for HK$4.93 billion.
Cathay's announcement of the deal contained a warning that an HK Express shareholder planned to contest it. That shareholder is Zhong, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the issue. They declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
In a further sign that the relationship between Zhong and HNA had soured, court papers show that HNA in December sued the company through which Zhong holds his 27 percent stake in the airline, seeking repayment of a HK$854 million debt from 2010.
A representative for Zhong did not provide comment.
CONTROL DISPUTES 
Since the April 1 meeting, Frontier has aligned itself with Zhong, working to appoint him chairman of the airline as part of efforts to seize control and investigate its financial ties with HNA.
Late last week they won an injunction that blocked directors and executives from removing or destroying the airline's documents. 
That followed a week in which both Zhong and airline executive Hou Wei - still listed on its website as chairman - claimed control and fought over who had access to the company's headquarters. 
Adding to the confusion, a group called Grand City Investment Capital Limited this week said it owned the Frontier stake after a transfer dated April 11. 
A spokesman for Grand City declined to discuss his company's ownership. Frontier disputes Grand City's claim to the stake.
Frontier and Zhong have also accused HNA of ""embezzlement of HKA assets and serious financial misappropriation by HNA Group parties"" - accusations that HNA has denied. 
They and other shareholders are still demanding access to the airline's 2018 accounts and details of how it lost so much money before they address its HK$2 billion capital shortfall. 
Amid the court orders and competing statements uncertainty remains over who is in charge - although both sides have gone to lengths to ensure the airline keeps operating normally. 
""There are so many moving parts that corporate control is under dispute because the changes are happening too rapidly for the company to organize coherently,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, which focuses on China. He described HNA as ""a poster child for overexpansion of China's worst conglomerates.""
He added: ""Because there is always a lack of transparency at HNA, this makes it twice as hard to figure out what the nature of the dispute is.""

51,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>",Uber to kick off investor road show with IPO terms on Friday,"By Joshua Franklin and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc will unveil terms for its initial public offering on Friday, telling investors it will seek to be valued at between $80 billion and $90 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The valuation sought is less than the $120 billion valuation that investment bankers told Uber last year it could fetch, and closer to the $76 billion valuation it attained in its last private fundraising round last year.
Uber's moderation of valuation expectations reflects the poor stock performance of its smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) following its IPO last month. Lyft shares ended trading on Thursday down 22 percent from their IPO price amid investor skepticism over its path to profitability.
Uber will unveil on Friday an IPO price range of between $44 and $50 per share, based on which it would raise between $8 billion and $9 billion, the sources said. This would rank it as the largest IPO since that of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014.
In addition, some Uber insiders will also sell their own shares in the IPO, the sources said. Reuters reported earlier this month that the combined value of Uber shares sold in the IPO could be around $10 billion.
Uber also plans to unveil on Friday its last sale of stock as a private company.  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) plans to invest $500 million in a concurrent private placement at Uber's IPO price, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The deal includes a partnership to expand PayPal as a payment option for Uber rides to most of the 70-plus countries where Uber operates.
The PayPal investment was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
In addition, Uber and PayPal will collaborate on digital payment solutions, including the expansion of Uber's digital wallet such that customers could, for instance, use it for purchases other of an Uber ride, the person said. 
The development of a more robust digital payments service could accelerate Uber's ambitions to become a ""superapp"" for a variety of logistics and transportation services, and give the company more opportunities in underbanked regions such as Latin America.
Southeast Asia's ride-hailing company Grab, for example, has built out a line of financial services, including loans and insurance, to accelerate its growth in the region.
PayPal's investment and collaboration are contingent upon Uber completing its IPO.
The investor roadshow will kick off in earnest on Monday, setting the stage for Uber to debut on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.
For the roadshow, Uber's top executives will travel the Unites States and make a stop in London to drum up investor interest in the IPO, sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Uber declined to comment. The price range was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Two other IPOs this month, those of online scrapbook company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc and video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc, have performed much better than Lyft. Uber, however, has chosen to still value itself conservatively.
""People are more cautious than they were 4 weeks ago,"" said Duncan Davidson, general partner at Bullpen Capital, an early-stage venture capital investment firm. 
In addition to ride hailing, Uber's business includes bike and scooter rentals, freight hauling, food delivery and an expensive self-driving car division.
The ride-hailing company has disclosed it has 91 million users, but growth is slowing and it may never make a profit. Uber in 2018 had $11.3 billion in revenue, up around 42 percent over 2017, but below the 106 percent growth the prior year.
During the IPO roadshow, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.
Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.
Uber is reserving some shares in the IPO for some of its most active and best-performing drivers, including those who have completed at least 2,500 trips.
SCALING THE BUSINESS
Last week, Uber's autonomous vehicle unit raised $1 billion privately from a consortium of investors, including top Uber shareholder SoftBank Group Corp, allowing it to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors and appease some Wall Street concerns over spending.
One advantage Uber will likely seek to play up to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it operates. Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber's business model to become profitable.
Lyft, which was valued at $24.3 billion in its IPO, has focused only in the U.S. and Canadian markets. 

""Investors are now asking for more clarity on how ride-sharing companies will monetize data they are collecting and if this is a scalable business,"" said Jordan Stuart, a client portfolio manager for Federated Kaufmann funds who often purchases stock in IPOs.

(NYSE:BRKa) might increase already-sizable stakes in the banking sector, Barclays’s Jay Gelb and Jason Goldberg write in a note.
The Fed proposal would allow up to 25 percent ownership of a bank, compared with about 10 percent currently, without triggering oversight of the investor, if other qualitative factors are met, they said. Berkshire Hathaway currently has close to 10 percent ownership of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., BNY Mellon Corp., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), they noted, as bank investments accounted for more than 40 percent of the firm’s $173 billion equity investment portfolio as of the end of 2018.
“Buffett has intentionally kept its ownership below the 10 percent threshold to avoid Fed oversight of Berkshire,” they said. Gelb and Goldberg noted that Berkshire also owns 18 percent of  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)., based on a special Fed oversight exemption.
It’s unclear whether Berkshire would materially increase ownership stakes in banks in which it holds about 10 percent. However, a rule shift would at least mean it would “have the option of doing so, or not being required to sell shares due to share buybacks pushing its ownership stake above 10 percent,” they wrote. Buffett might also consider increasing stakes in other banks Berkshire owns at smaller scales, such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB)., Synchrony Financial, PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., they added.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",Lloyd's of London plots new course as storm clouds gather,"By Carolyn Cohn and Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurer of seafaring vessels, is facing its own perfect storm. Old-fashioned business practices, exposure to natural disasters, competition from rival centers and Brexit are all threatening Lloyd's reputation as the place to insure anything from ships to sculptures to soccer stars' legs. Stung by combined losses of 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) over the last two years, John Neal, the new chief executive of an insurance market founded in a London coffee house in 1688, is under growing pressure to drag Lloyd's into the 21st century. Following a six-month review, Neal will unveil a new strategy next week expected to include a push to automate arcane processes, a shift away from risky catastrophe insurance, a hard look at the middlemen who drive up the cost of doing business at Lloyd's and ways to attract new sources of capital.
It is also looking to improve inclusion at a time when the culture at Lloyd's is in the spotlight following a report by Bloomberg News about sexual harassment and day-time drinking.
But in a market where shipwrecks are still recorded by some insurers with a quill and paperwork is lugged around Lloyd's futuristic 14-storey building in slipcases, some brokers and underwriters are resisting innovation. ""Lloyd's has to change, it's like an old man dancing - a bit awkward and embarrassing,"" said one insurance company chief executive, who declined to be named. ""We do not have a great track record in modernization."" All of Lloyd's brokers are meant to shift to an electronic platform by June, but many are complaining about the cost and increased transparency - which risks hurting their fees. Underwriters are meant to move 50 percent of their business to the platform by the middle of the year but several are behind, and much of their business has been deemed outside the scope of the automation drive. ""Recent performance has not been acceptable and the work we began last year has placed the market on a much firmer footing,"" Neal, who joined as CEO in October, told Reuters.
""The focus now turns to the changes we must make to ensure Lloyd's succeeds in the future – by supercharging innovation, simplifying the process for capital to access Lloyd's, automating claims processes, lowering costs by making an electronic exchange, and creating a culture of inclusivity.""
'DEFINITELY A THREAT' Lloyd's is not an insurance company in itself but a group of 99 syndicates, or members, who price and underwrite policies and spread the risk among themselves. More than 150 brokers act as middlemen with clients, along with another group of intermediaries known as managing general agents.
Once mostly wealthy individuals, members now include small underwriters and listed firms such as Beazley and Hiscox, as well as global insurers specializing in business lines such as shipping, aviation and property. The problem for Lloyd's is that while it still has global cachet and a strong A credit rating, investors from hedge funds to private equity firms looking for higher yields are piling into rival centers such as Bermuda, New York and Singapore. While Lloyd's reputation for specialization and innovation has pushed it to the forefront of new areas such as insurance against hacking, cheaper centers are muscling in on its turf. Bermuda, for example, has developed a specialism in catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities.
""It definitely is a threat and it will happen in a number of areas,"" said industry veteran Andrew Bathurst, director of PWS Gulf, an insurance broker in London and Dubai. ""Lloyd's is aware that overseas underwriters are looking at those classes of business and weighing up whether to underwrite them."" 
""If we should see some more losses, particularly on the older accounts, then Lloyd's will come under pressure and then there will be more incentive to look outside,"" said Bathurst, who has been a Lloyd's underwriter and CEO of a Lloyd's broker. SLOW TECH Automating claims processes to cut costs in a market where most business is still done face-to-face is one of the areas highlighted in a Lloyd's leaflet hinting at its new strategy. Lloyd's has an expense ratio - costs divided by net premiums - of 40 percent, according to ratings agency AM Best. Sources say this is some 10 points higher than commercial insurers like Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) or AIG (NYSE:AIG) in the United States. ""The market needs to modernize. It does not make sense to have business placed by paper when we have the technology,"" said Ian Fantozzi, chief operating officer at Beazley, which manages seven Lloyd's syndicates.
Hiscox has also embraced technological change but Lloyd's has struggled to persuade some underwriters and brokers to adopt an electronic processing platform launched in July 2016. While some say the system is easy to use, others complain it is unwieldy and creates, rather than reduces, workload. Former Lloyd's CEO Inga Beale made it compulsory last year for syndicates to shift their business to the platform because underwriters had moved only 10 percent voluntarily.
Underwriters who miss the targets face charges while brokers could be deregistered - a rare event in the market. For smaller brokers and underwriters, however, the upfront costs of adapting to the system are high. Persuading them to change is like ""herding cats"", according to one market source. One senior broker said the system was not ideal because different syndicates work and use it in different ways. The system is suited to simple, commoditized policies, rather than the complex business with lots of conditions and clauses for which Lloyd's is known, the insurance CEO said.
Smaller brokers are also wary of the increased transparency provided by the system, which would expose their charging structures and could put pressure on their fees, said one City of London source familiar with Lloyd's. Charles Manchester, chairman of the Managing General Agents' Association, also said there was no great demand from brokers. POWER SHIFT? Despite the inertia, Lloyd's will be reluctant to push too hard by imposing sanctions for non-compliance at such a sensitive time for the industry, which is grappling with lower premiums globally, City of London sources said. ""There is a growing worry that this could compel many brokers to leave,"" said a second City source familiar with Lloyd's. ""In the past, British banks would insist on using Lloyd's of London to write insurance. That balance of power is shifting and other centers could emerge, such as New York."" The risk to Lloyd's and other insurance companies in London was highlighted in a 2017 report by Boston Consulting Group and industry association London Market Group. It said the market faced competition from emerging markets and Bermuda, Singapore and Switzerland, helped by lower costs of capital and expense.
London's share of global reinsurance premiums fell to 12.3 percent in 2015, from 13.4 percent in 2013, and 15 percent in 2010. Premiums from emerging markets fell to $9.3 billion in 2015 from $10.5 billion in 2013, the report said. London is still the largest center for commercial insurance and reinsurance, but Singapore, Bermuda and Switzerland grew by 4 percent, 1 percent and 0.6 percent respectively each year from 2013 to 2015, while London shrank 0.3 percent, the report said.

Lloyd's is also facing a threat from European competition due to Britain's impending departure from the European Union. Lloyd's has opened a subsidiary in Brussels to cope with Brexit but it operates under a complex structure which some market sources worry will not prove popular. ""Lloyd's of London is beginning to fracture. With the fallout from Brexit, more companies have started to look around the world and ask whether they need to be in London,"" the second City of London source said. ""Underwriters in France and Germany are now starting to look at writing their business locally,"" the source said.

56,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>","Nintendo's Guidance Seen as a `Mockery,' Sending Shares Lower","(Bloomberg) -- Nintendo Co (T:7974).’s muted forecast for its financial performance in the current fiscal year stunned investors and analysts, sending shares sliding.
The company’s stock tumbled as much as 5.1 percent after it forecast operating profit of 260 billion yen ($2.3 billion) this year, well short of the 350.2 billion yen average of estimates. Analysts were particularly befuddled by the forecast that it will sell 125 million new software titles, significantly below market expectations for 161 million and lower than all but one of 10 projections tracked by Bloomberg.
“The way they guided software growth, it’s a mockery of the whole guidance word and the process,” Atul Goyal, a senior analyst at Jefferies Group, said on Bloomberg TV. “The way they’re guiding overall software sales to grow only 5 percent after having 85 percent growth last year is unreal. It’s a joke.”
Goyal said Japanese companies including Nintendo are known for making conservative estimates at the start of each fiscal period. But even by those standards, President Shuntaro Furukawa’s projection stands out amid a blockbuster games lineup this year and expectations for stronger hardware growth, which drives software sales. The company could be wary of repeating last year’s mishap, when it issued bullish guidance but cut it later, which sent the stock plunging.
Shares have rebounded this year on optimism that a cheaper version of the Switch, a stronger pipeline of games and a potential entry into China will help overcome last year’s missteps and broaden Nintendo’s customer base beyond dedicated fans. But Furukawa tamped down those expectations after the results, saying the China launch is far off and there’s no plan to unveil a new Switch at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in the U.S. in June.
“As a general rule, we’re always working on new hardware and we will announce it when we are able to sell it,” Furukawa told reporters in Osaka. “But we have no plans to announce that at this year’s E3 in June.”
Analysts downplayed the comments, saying the company wouldn’t announce new hardware as it would cannibalize sales of the existing Switch. But they pointed to a drop in the company’s inventory as signs it could be clearing out existing stock to prepare for a new model.
Operating profit was 29.7 billion yen in the three months ended March, below the 36 billion yen expected by analysts. The company shipped 17 million Switch consoles last fiscal year and forecast 18 million for the current period, compared with analyst projections for 18.5 million. It sold 119 million software units last fiscal year, slightly below analyst projections for 121 million.
The Switch sports a stronger software lineup this fiscal year, with two new mainline Pokemon games slated by the end of 2019. New entries in the Animal Crossing and Luigi’s Mansion series are also scheduled for this year, as well as a remake of an older Zelda title. On Friday, Furukawa told analysts that software sales momentum was robust, raising more questions about why the company’s official guidance wasn’t in line with management’s comments.
“The forecast is quite conservative and leaves a negative impression,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, an analyst at Matsui Securities in Tokyo.
Shares of Nintendo had risen 32 percent this year prior to the results, compared with an 8.4 percent rise in the Topix index. The company announced it would pay a full-year dividend of 810 yen, higher than last year’s 590 yen.
Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo is working with Tencent Holdings Ltd. to sell the Switch in China, but said there’s no timeline for a launch. Shares jumped 15 percent last Friday after Tencent received the first of several regulatory approvals necessary for sales to begin.
“Our current applications are just for the hardware, but we’ll also need inspections of our software,” Furukawa said regarding the Chinese business. “We will need many more applications to the government and others, so from that perspective the launch period is still unknown.”
While demand for console gaming remains limited on the mainland, analysts say closer ties with the social media giant could lead to Nintendo releasing mobile titles in China, the world’s biggest gaming market.
Smartphone game revenue grew 24 percent in the latest quarter from a year ago to 12.7 billion yen. Nintendo plans to release two mobile games this summer: Dr. Mario World and Mario Kart Tour. Analysts have speculated that Mario Kart could become a billion-dollar grossing app if executed properly, but the company has delayed the title once and has yet to provide a single screenshot of the game. On Thursday, Nintendo confirmed it will begin a closed beta test of the app from May 22.
With no new 3DS titles scheduled for the coming year, the company is signaling the end for the eight-year-old handheld device. Revenue from the 3DS business was 63 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March, down 67 percent from the prior period.
Paid accounts for its online service exceeded 9.8 million, Nintendo said Friday. Digital sales which include online subscriptions jumped 95 percent to 119 billion yen.
The company could benefit from the highly anticipated Detective Pikachu movie, which launches in Japan May 3 and globally on May 10. Nintendo owns a significant stake in Pokemon Co. and recorded 6.9 billion yen of operating profit from that investment in the latest fiscal year -- most of it likely from Pokemon Go.
“We view results themselves as neutral but think the share price will continue trending upward for now,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts Masahiro Ono and Yui Yasumoto wrote in a report. They maintained their positive outlook due to the “potential to overshoot guidance based on the possibility of sales to China being added in over the course of the year.”

57,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 11:01PM ET</span>",SAS cancels many flights as pilots in Sweden go on strike,"STOCKHOLM/COPENHAGEN/OSLO (Reuters) - SAS said on Friday many of its domestic, European and long-haul flights have been canceled as Swedish pilots at the airline went on a strike after rejecting mediators' bid, affecting thousands of travelers.
The Swedish pilots' union in SAS Scandinavia has called a strike after it rejected a bid tabled by mediators to reach a deal, SAS said on Friday.
In addition to the 205 departures canceled on Thursday, another 110 flights will be canceled on Friday, affecting tens of thousands of passengers, the airline said.
""SAS is prepared to continue to negotiate, but if the requirements were to be met, they would have very negative consequences for the company,"" the airline said.
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish pilot unions had earlier this month called for 1,500 pilots to go on strike on April 26 if no agreement was reached on wages and other issues after an earlier round of talks failed to bear results.
Flights operated by SAS Ireland and airlines that are subcontractors of SAS will not be affected by the strike, SAS said, adding that negotiations are still ongoing in Denmark and Norway.
Torbjörn Granevärn, head of negotiations at the Swedish Confederation of Transport Enterprises' airlines section, had earlier said Swedish pilots had rejected the proposal despite provisions that provided greater scheduling predictability.
""We think that is very unfortunate,"" he said in an emailed statement late on Thursday.
SAS, which normally flies around 800 flights per day, had said earlier on Thursday it would cancel 205 flights from midnight until noon on Friday as a precautionary measure as the negotiations between SAS and four pilot unions had dragged on.
Norwegian state mediator Mats Ruland told public broadcaster NRK that the breakdown of Swedish mediation did not directly affect negotiations with pilots in Norway.
As a midnight deadline passed, Norsk Pilotforbund, one of two Norwegian unions, said their talks were still ongoing. The Danish union was not immediately reachable for comment. 
A strike by all the unions would affect 70 percent of SAS flights, with the remaining 30 percent operated by partners left unaffected. Around 170,000 travelers could be impacted if the strike lasted through the weekend, according to Annamatz. 
Earlier this week, the airline offered travelers concerned about a possible strike the chance to reschedule flights for the April 26-29 period to another date free of charge.
SAS is in the midst of renewing an elderly and fuel-intensive fleet after spending years cutting costs in the face of cut-price competition from budget carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.

The airline reported a bigger-than-expected loss for its fiscal first quarter in February, but said it still expected to record a profit for the full year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nintendo Co (T:7974) Ltd's shares fell as much as 5 percent in early Tokyo trading, a day after the gaming company offered conservative earnings guidance and urged caution on the roll-out of its Switch console in China.
Nintendo's shares were down 2 percent at 1106 local time (0206 GMT), underperforming the benchmark index which was down 0.8 percent.
The Kyoto-based gaming company said on Thursday it expected to shift 18 million Switch hardware units this financial year, which would give the console a total install base of 53 million units.
Despite this, Nintendo is forecasting a meager 5.4 percent rise in Switch software sales on a year earlier to 125 million units.
That is seen as conservative by many analysts, with the Switch's games pipeline this year including two full Pokemon titles and the latest in the popular Luigi's Mansion and Animal Crossing series.
""Whether it would reach its targets became a big theme last year so Nintendo has released figures it can be confident of hitting,"" said analyst Hideki Yasuda at Ace Securities.
The guidance creates ""a very low bar for the rest of the year,"" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note.

61,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 09:54PM ET</span>",Judge gives U.S. six months to identify separated migrant children,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday he would order the Trump administration to comb through the records of 47,000 immigrant children and within six months identify those separated from their parents after crossing the Mexican border.
While a government official said at Thursday's hearing he hoped to meet the deadline, the government said earlier this month it might take two years to identify the separated children. 
""I am going to issue an order to do this in six months, subject to good cause,"" said U.S. Judge Dana Sabraw at a hearing in San Diego. ""It is important for all government actors to have a time frame and I intend to stand on it.""
The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of parents separated from their children, pressed Sabraw to give the government a firm deadline. 
Last year, Sabraw ordered the government to reunite around 2,700 children who were separated under the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy of criminally prosecuting illegal border crossers, even if they had children.
The ACLU said the reunifications were generally successful because the government scrambled to comply with Sabraw's order to complete the task in 30 days.
The administration abandoned the zero tolerance policy last year in the wake of widespread outcry.
In January, an internal government watchdog said there were potentially thousands more separated migrant children, although the exact number is unclear due to informal record keeping. 
Sabraw expanded the class action case in March to include the parents of this newly identified group of children.
The government needs to review records for 47,000 immigrant children to determine which ones might be covered by the expanded class action, Jonathan White testified at the Thursday's court hearing.
White, an official with the Department of Health and Human Services, said his team had already identified between 500 and 1,000 children who might have been separated from their parents. 

The watchdog report said prior to the official zero-tolerance policy, the government began ramping up separations in 2017 for other reasons related to a child’s safety and well-being, including separating parents with criminal records or lack of proper documents.

About two-thirds of the 50 mostly large-cap Kospi index firms that have announced first-quarter earnings since early this week have missed analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts have lowered estimates for the index’s first-quarter earnings by 3.7 percentage points in April, according to KB Securities in Seoul.
Meanwhile, estimated earnings per share has fallen to the lowest level since the end of 2016. Valuations of Kospi companies are also a burden -- shares are trading at more than 11 times of their 12-month forward earnings, the highest since 2016.
One need look no further than tech stocks, which have the biggest weighting at almost 30 percent of the Kospi. An earnings disappointment from LG Display Co., a LCD panel maker, soured investor sentiment for the entire tech sector on Wednesday, including the likes of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. Peer SK Hynix Inc. added to the concerns by posting operating profit less than half its level from a year earlier.
“All of the market participants had been worried about first-quarter earnings for firms in both the U.S. and South Korea,” said Seo Sang-young, strategist at Kiwoom Securities. “They were wrong for the U.S., but correct for South Korea.”
The Kospi has still managed a 7.3 percent rally this year, though it falls well short of the MSCI All-Country World Index’s 15 percent advance.
The trouble on the earnings front comes as South Korea’s economy shows increasing signs of strain, posting the weakest growth for the first quarter in more than a decade. The nation posted first-quarter growth of 1.8 percent year-over-year, well short of economist estimates of 2.4 percent. Quarter-over-quarter growth meanwhile contracted 0.3 percent, while economists had expected an expansion. Exports contracted 2.6 percent from the previous quarter.

While the first-quarter GDP data was somewhat expected, what surprised investors more were “shocking earnings” of some large-cap stocks, according to Park So-yeon, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. Among them was Samsung Biologics Co., the biotechnology arm of Samsung Group that posted an unexpected loss, disappointing many retail investors who poured money into a darling of the nation’s stock market amid the South Korea government’s push to nurture the industry.
Even with the recent headwinds, foreign investors see some upside potential in South Korea. They have added net 6.8 trillion won ($5.8 billion) of Kospi shares this year, mostly in Samsung and SK Hynix. The inflow into Korean equities has come mainly thanks to the Federal Reserve’s dovish stance, optimism about an end to the U.S.-China trade war and China’s stimulus measures, according to KB Securities.
“Worries over the trade war are already being priced in,” Heo Pil-Seok, chief executive officer at Midas International Asset Management, said.. “Some people start to say that it is time to buy the dip before a turnaround in the second half for some sectors.”
Commodity Prices
But the challenges can’t be ignored. Another one: The rise in commodity prices including oil is also a negative for many exporters in Korea. Posco, South Korea’s largest steel producer, posted a drop in profit and warned weakening demand and higher input costs with soaring iron ore prices. Refiners like SK also said the U.S. decision on ending the waivers on Iranian crude will lead costs to surge.
OCI Co., a chemical firm, reported greater-than-expected losses as the solar power industry struggled due to delayed stimulus measures of the Chinese government, according to Shinhan Investment Corp. China, the biggest trading partner for South Korea, also weighed on Korean exporters amid the ongoing trade conflict with the U.S.
“The U.S.-China trade war is hitting Korean traditional industries,” said Heo. “Especially, chips, refinery and chemical, which are heavily dependent on Chinese demand, are being affected.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER), Didi Chuxing and other ride-hailing firms on Thursday criticized a host of new regulations of the sector in Mexico's capital city, which include a ban on cash fares that could exclude many potential customers who lack bank accounts. 
Mexico City's government on Wednesday issued rules that prohibit cash payments for ride-hailing services, require drivers to register with the city, and ban the use of cheaper cars, among other measures.
The regulations mark a setback for San Francisco-based Uber in one of its largest markets ahead of a planned initial public offering. The company has fought hard for the right to accept cash fares in Mexico, arguing that it is a critical tool to reach the millions of Mexicans who do not use credit or debit cards.
In a joint statement, Uber, China's Didi, Spain's Cabify and Greece's Beat said Mexico City's government agreed in February to work with the sector as it updated regulation. But the new rules were issued ""unilaterally and without prior dialogue,"" the firms said.
""We are concerned that, as it stands, this reform creates a series of barriers to entry,"" the companies said in a joint statement, which was also signed by Estonia's Bolt and Mexico's Laudrive. They said drivers could see a hit to their earnings.
Mexico City's transport ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Minister Andres Lajous told a news conference that the rules were aimed at rooting out corruption and leveling the playing field for ride-hailing firms and taxi drivers. 
The regulations also prohibit pre-paid cards, which are frequently used by tech companies in Mexico to reach customers who do not have credit or debit cards.
Uber began accepting cash in Mexico City last year after Mexico's Supreme Court struck down a ban on cash fares in the western state of Colima. 
Uber said in a separate statement on Wednesday that the Mexico City regulation contradicts the Supreme Court's decision, which it has argued should be used as a precedent nationwide. 

Didi said in a statement on Thursday that banning cash payments would affect the unbanked population and potentially worsen mobility throughout Mexico City.

The deal related to the Tartaruga Verde field and Module 3 of the Espadarte field. 
The deal is part of Petrobras' divestment program, which seeks to reduce indebtedness. In its statement, the company also announced it had nearly completed the full sale of its TAG pipeline unit to France's Engie for $8.6 billion.
""Continuous portfolio management contributes to improving the allocation of capital, thereby increasing the generation of value for our shareholders, in addition to enabling the reduction of indebtedness and cost of the company's capital,"" the company's chief executive, Roberto Castello Branco, said in a statement.
Petrobras said that the total amount of asset divestments so far this year already amounts to $11.3 billion. 
Petrobras said the value of the transaction with Petronas will be paid in two installments: $258.7 million on Thursday and $1.03 billion at the close of the transaction. 
Petrobras will maintain a 50 percent stake and the operation of the fields, while Petronas will get a bigger toehold in oil production in Brazil, where it already operates in the lubricants segment.
The Tartaruga Verde field began operations on June 22 and currently produces about 103,000 barrels per day of oil and 1.2 million cubic meters per day of gas.
Module 3 is an area of ​​the Espadarte field to be developed in an integrated way with the Tartaruga Verde and is expected to begin producing oil in 2021.
Petrobras also announced the assignment of its total participation in 34 onshore production fields to the company Potiguar E & P S.A., a subsidiary of Petrorecôncavo.
The total value of the transaction is $384.2 million to be paid in three installments.

Petrorecôncavo, which presented the second best offer of the tender process, was selected after the disqualification of the company 3R Petroleum.

The SEC in February sought to have Musk found in contempt of a fraud settlement last year after the CEO tweeted details about Tesla production numbers that were not vetted by the electric vehicle company's attorneys.
Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan ordered Musk and the SEC to try to resolve the dispute on their own. The parties have already requested one extension.

The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The parties later settled and Musk agreed to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company. Musk's lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club Prime in just one day, instead of two days, part of a spending ramp-up that may curb near-term profits and will up the ante for retail rivals such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
Shares rose as much as 2 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday as Amazon said faster shipping will come to customers around the world and said its profit more than doubled in the first quarter, trouncing estimates thanks to soaring demand for its cloud and ad services.
The news marks a costly challenge for competitors that will have to pour money into a logistics problem that even the king of e-commerce has yet to solve. Amazon expects to spend $800 million toward the shipping goal in the second quarter alone.
""There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side,"" Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a conference call. ""We (are) again, trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity, especially with third-party partners, that we have.""
While Olsavsky did not provide a concrete timeline for the program's rollout, he said, ""We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year.""
U.S. rivals Walmart and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) have steadily rolled out two-day shipping, albeit on far fewer items than Amazon Prime customers can get at that speed for $119 a year in the United States. Olsavsky said the ""vast majority"" of Amazon's selection is available in two days, and the company has already expanded the number of goods eligible for same-day and two-hour delivery.
""Amazon is cranking it up a notch, trying to set themselves apart,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, a former UPS analyst who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights.
She estimated that roughly 20 percent to 25 percent of Amazon's shipping is currently within one day, noting that speedy service was easy in large U.S. metro areas where it already had built out its delivery network. However, costs can be prohibitive elsewhere.
""I don’t know how they are going to do it in ‘Little Town USA,'"" she said.
MORE PROFIT TO SPEND
Shifts in the nature of Amazon's business have afforded the company windfalls that it now can apply toward its ambitious delivery program.
The company's loyal customer base has drawn merchants to sell and increasingly advertise through its site in exchange for fees. In the first quarter, revenue from seller services jumped 20 percent to $11.1 billion, while ad and other sales surged 34 percent to $2.7 billion, the company said.
Meanwhile, Amazon's cash cow, its cloud unit known as AWS that sells data storage and computing services to enterprises, saw operating income grow 59 percent to $2.2 billion.
The numbers reflect Amazon's transformation from a low-margin retail business to a more lucrative marketplace and technology behemoth. While revenue growth slowed, profit surged to $3.6 billion in the first quarter, beating analysts' expectations of $2.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company forecast net sales of between $59.5 billion and $63.5 billion for the second quarter, the midpoint of which was below analysts' average estimate of $62.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
""Amazon delivered slower growth in all key segments – AWS, advertising and e-commerce – but margins skyrocketed, seemingly driven by less aggressive investment,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.
Olsavsky, Amazon's CFO, said the company was still reaping rewards from prior years of hiring and investments in warehouses and other infrastructure. The company had managed and complied with regulatory changes in India, which only months earlier had caused Amazon some uncertainty. But investment would soon ramp up, he said.
Amazon estimated that second-quarter operating income would be as much as $3.6 billion, short of the $4.2 billion analysts were expecting, according to FactSet.
The company plans to spend more to roll out benefits to international Prime members. Hiring would also pick up from the 12 percent increase Amazon posted in the past 12 months, according to Olsavsky.
The company is delving into even less familiar terrain, too. It recently announced investments in self-driving and electric car companies, teasing how it thinks these high-tech, capital-intensive businesses could pay dividends potentially in the form of autonomous deliveries in the long run. Amazon has not described in detail its thinking behind the bets.
The initiatives reflect how the world's largest online retailer has long invested in still-untested technology and programs, like its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market to bolster home grocery deliveries.
The marches into new industries has been lucrative to shareholders, including its founder Jeff Bezos, who is the richest man in the world.

It shares surged 8.2 percent to $75.47.
Grubhub, which is battling startups ranging from DoorDash and Uber Eats to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Amazon Restaurants, has swept up more than a half-dozen companies since its April 2014 initial public offering and has been spending aggressively to fend off competition.
During the first quarter, Grubhub had an increase in diners, improved quality and stable costs, the company's chief financial officer, Adam DeWitt, said.
""There's been a lot of investor fear around Grubhub losing its edge as a leader in the digital takeout market,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Ygal Arounian.
The latest report showed that Grubhub has a differentiated offering and ""will remain a leader,"" Arounian said.
Active diners grew 28 percent to 19.3 million during the quarter, bolstered by partner Taco Bell's national campaign promoting delivery from the fast-food chain.
Grubhub's first-quarter net income fell 78 percent to $6.9 million, or 7 cents per share. Excluding items, it earned 30 cents per share, beating analysts average estimate of 25 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company, which also has projects with Dunkin' Donuts and Pizza Hut, hinted at more to come.
""I would love to announce the multiple deals that I'm aware are already signed, but we can't because the brands would prefer to announce when they are preparing to announce,"" Chief Executive Matthew Maloney said on a conference call.
Revenue jumped 39 percent to $323.8 million during the quarter, topping analysts' estimate of $323 million.
Total costs and expenses climbed 57 percent to $314.9 million during the quarter, when sales and marketing outlays expanded almost 61 percent to $78.5 million.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc earlier this month said Uber Eats had $1.5 billion in 2018 revenue, but that payments to its Uber Eats drivers ""historically have exceeded the cumulative delivery fees paid by consumers.""
Beyond that, the fast-growing service charges its largest chain restaurant partners - which include McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) - lower service fees to compete in the crowded field.
Those pressures have caused Uber Eats' ""take rate"" - or the percentage of revenue it keeps from each restaurant order - to decline and could ""at times"" push then into losses, Uber said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Greenhill & Co. has hired former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker Alfredo Porretti to build up the investment bank's business of defending companies against activist investors, a source said on Thursday.
Porretti will join Greenhill as a managing director, heading the New York-based firm's shareholder advisory practice. At Morgan Stanley, where he worked for nearly three years, he was an executive director. Previously he worked in the shareholder advisory group at Lazard and before that as a lawyer. 
Representatives for Greenhill and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Like rivals Moelis & Company, Evercore, Lazard and Centerview Partners, Greenhill concentrates on defending companies from investors who are pushing management to perform better and calling for strategic reviews, spin-offs and returning capital to investors by buying back shares.
Activism defense has evolved into a must-have business for most Wall Street banks even as the work can be time consuming and not terribly lucrative. It is seen as a conduit to better paying mergers and acquisitions work.
Greenhill, which was founded more than two decades ago by veteran Morgan Stanley dealmaker Robert Greenhill, is run by Scott Bok, who trained under Greenhill at Morgan Stanley.
Among its recent work, Greenhill is currently advising Gannett, the newspaper company that owns USA Today, as it seeks to fight off MNG Enterprises Inc., the hedge fund-owned media company that tried to buy it and says it could run it more efficiently. MNG scaled back its request for board seats on Thursday and no longer wants control of the board.
Greenhill has clients in the United States and Europe. Porretti speaks Italian and French and has previously worked to defend European companies against activists. 
The bank has hit some rough spots over the last years as deals slowed and its stock has dropped 45 percent in the last four years. In 2017, Greenhill and Bok helped engineer a partial leveraged buyout when they injected $20 million into the firm.
Morgan Stanley was ranked as the top adviser to companies targeted by activist investors publicly for the third straight year in 2018, according to Refinitiv data.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 07:12PM ET</span>",Ford more confident of stronger 2019 despite 'volatile environment',"By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Thursday posted a better-than-expected first quarter largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market and said it was more confident in its forecast 2019 would bring better results than last year.
The first-quarter results sent Ford's shares up as much as 8 percent in after-market trading.
Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters at company headquarters in suburban Detroit that Ford has more confidence its 2019 results will be better than last year's, but said it is in a ""volatile environment with very strong competition.""
Shanks added the first quarter would likely be Ford's best for the year.
Ford is restructuring its business, which includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets, including China and Europe.
Virtually all of the No. 2 U.S. automaker's profit in the quarter was generated in the U.S. market, thanks to a strong performance by its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks and its new Ranger midsize pickup. The company lost money in most other markets, but less than it had expected.
Two of every five full-size pickups sold in the United States in the first quarter were Ford F-series, with segment-leading transaction prices averaging just under $48,000, according to Jim Farley, president of New Businesses, Technology & Strategy.
The company's decision to kill off most of its unprofitable passenger cars in the U.S. market meant that its revenue rose 2 percent despite a 14 percent drop in wholesale unit sales.
Shanks said that move was worth ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and helped drive pretax margins in North America to 8.7 percent, up nearly a point from a year ago.
Ford also made a small profit in Europe and the profit at its financing arm also grew. But the automaker's global market share fell to 5.9 percent from 6.5 percent as it lost ground in every major market except North America.
""The business is now turning in a positive direction,"" Shanks said. But ""it's the beginning of the game, it's not game over,"" he added.
The automaker is struggling in China, where earlier this month, Ford said it planned to launch more than 30 new models over the next three years.
China unit sales fell 48 percent in the quarter, but Ford said higher-priced products helped deliver a smaller loss than in the same quarter in 2018.
In March, German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Ford signed a deal to develop mid-size pickup trucks and are continuing discussions about extending the alliance to include electric and autonomous vehicles and mobility services.
The two automakers have yet to reach agreement on a potential VW investment in Ford's Argo AI self-driving unit.
Shanks said those talks were ""going very well.""
Ford said this week that it would invest $500 million in U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC, joining e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc in backing the potential rival to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
Ford posted a quarterly net profit of $1.15 billion or 29 cents per share, down 34 percent from $1.74 billion or 43 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 44 cents per share, above analyst estimates of 27 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Ford reported revenue of $40.3 billion for the quarter, down 4 percent from $42 billion a year earlier.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",Intel cuts forecast as China data center sales remain weak,"By Sayanti Chakraborty and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) on Thursday cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed analysts' estimates for first-quarter sales for the data center business that has driven growth as PC sales declined in recent years, sending its shares down as much as 7.5%.
Intel said China's economy was consuming fewer microchips than it had expected, adding to concerns that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019. Intel's outlook follows a similar warning earlier this week from chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc, whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the industry chip industry.
Intel marginally beat Wall Street targets for revenue and profit in the fiscal first quarter, but sales in the data center group unit fell 6.3% to $4.9 billion, hit by weakness in China as customers worked through stockpile of chips purchased last year. Analysts had expected revenue of $5.1 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm Fact Set.
""The data center rebound the company was banking on for back-half (of 2019) improvements doesn't look like it's going to happen,"" said Patrick Moor head of Moor Insights & Strategy.
Intel's chief executive, Bob Swan, said in an interview that customers in China had ""absolutely"" bought extra data center chips last year due to fears of a tariff or supply constraints owing to the U.S.-China trade dispute.
""The belief at the time was that they were ordering well ahead of what their real needs were, but the expectation was that they would consume that over the course of Q4 and Q1,"" Swan said. ""But today we think ... it's not being consumed quite at that level; there's going to be another quarter.""
While Intel highlighted problems in China, ""there was weakness, in terms of orders, across almost every single end-market for them,"" said Christopher Roll and, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. ""It's really across the board.""
The chipmaker cut its 2019 revenue forecast to $69 billion, from the $71.5 billion it told investors to expect when it last reported earnings in January. 
A year-long U.S.-China trade war and weakening smartphone sales have taken a toll on the global semiconductor industry. Investors are banking on the launch of 5G telecom networks and demand for chips used in self-driving vehicles to reignite growth. Swan said a 30% boost in so-called programmable chips that go into 5G networking equipment showed early gains for Intel.
Shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc rose 1.5% in extended trade after Intel's report, while graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp fell 2.5%. Intel also suffered a decline in its memory chip business, affected by the same pricing declines that have hurt rivals such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) .
Intel's business unit that sells modem chips to connect Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones to wireless data networks was a growth spot, despite Intel's announcement last week that it would exit the market for 5G modem chips. That news came the same day that Apple resolved a long-standing dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and the companies signed a chip supply agreement.
Swan said Intel expects to continue shipping 4G modems, though, as is customary for Intel, he did not mention Apple by name.
""Our expectation is we will continue to deliver on the 4G modem throughout the course of this year, including the second iteration of that product coming in the fall back-to-school season,"" Swan said.
The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker estimated profit of 89 cents per share on revenue of $15.6 billion for its second quarter that ends in June, compared with analysts' expectation of $1.01 per share on $16.85 billion.
For the first quarter, net income fell to $3.97 billion, or 87 cents per share, from $4.45 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 89 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 87 cents.
Revenue in Intel's client computing business, which caters to PC makers and still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 4.45% to $8.59 billion, beating Fact Set estimates of $8.38 billion.

Intel shares were trading down 7.5% at $57.61 after the bell.

Shares of the world's largest coffee chain, which have surged about 20 percent this year, pared gains after rising as much as 2 percent. They were still on track to hit a record high on Friday.
Its new drinks and a refreshed lunch menu focused on improving customer traffic during the lean afternoon hours boosted same-store sales by 4 percent at established U.S. cafes. Analysts were expecting sales growth of 3.58 percent.
Starbucks also added 13 percent more active members to its loyalty program in the United States as it expanded its delivery services to almost 1,600 stores in seven markets along with UberEats, and improved the speed of its ordering and payment processes on its app and at cafes. 
The coffee chain has also been beefing up its delivery network in its second biggest market, China, to more than 2,100 stores in 35 cities by teaming up with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
This comes as it competes with local startup Luckin Coffee, whose speedy growth led it to file for an IPO in the United States earlier this week. 
Same-store sales rose 2 percent in China/Asia Pacific region, helped by a 2 percent rise in average ticket. Analysts were expecting it to rise 1.5 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Starbucks also raised its adjusted profit forecast for the year to between $2.75 and $2.79 per share from its previous outlook of between $2.68 and $2.73 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $2.71 per share.
The company said operating margins in the Americas would now be ""up slightly"" instead of a drop expected earlier due to higher prices, restructuring efforts aimed at reducing costs and lower investments compared with last year. 
Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $663.2 million, or 53 cents per share, in the second-quarter ended March 31, from $660.1 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, the company earned 60 cents, 4 cents more than the estimate.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - International private companies have increased their investment in Brazil's power sector over the last three years even as the country's cash-strapped state-controlled companies have cut back, a Reuters survey of power companies shows.
Eight out of 11 large foreign private firms operating in Brazil boosted investments in the power sector from 2016 to 2018, some of them by more than 200 percent, the poll showed. Meanwhile, the three largest state-controlled firms - Eletrobras, Cemig and Copel - cut their annual spending by around 45 percent over the same period.
Expenditures by Eletrobras, or Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, fell by almost half over the period, leading the company to lose its historical position as investment-leader in the sector.
France's Engie topped the list of investors in Brazil's power sector in 2017 with 5.5 billion reais ($1.39 billion). China's State Grid topped the list in 2018 with 7.1 billion reais. 
Investments by U.S. AES Corp, Isa Cteep and Taesa all increased in the same period.
""The private companies are well capitalized and have large competitive advantages. State companies, on the other hand, are going through a very different moment,"" said power sector analyst Erico de Brito, from Excelência Energética consultancy.
    Private companies are also taking advantage of a regular schedule of auctions for licenses to build everything from power plants to transmission lines, with long-term contracts at fixed return rates. 
The new regulatory system means governments no longer need to inject public money to spur growth, said Nivalde de Castro, a power sector expert from Rio de Janeiro Federal University.
The current poor fiscal condition of state-owned companies is due to the local and federal government's lack of cash but also the fact that past investments that did not always pay off. 
Eletrobras and Cemig are going through robust divestment programs to get rid of projects they were unable to complete.
Both companies could soon be privatized. Minas Gerais' state government said it wants to sell Cemig, while the federal government plans to dilute its controlling stake in Eletrobras through a capital increase plan.

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Buffett had said in his February annual letter to shareholders that over time Berkshire would likely be a ""significant"" buyer of its own stock, when it traded below the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's estimate of its intrinsic value.
Berkshire repurchased $1.3 billion of its stock last year, after Buffett loosened the company's buyback criteria.
The buybacks began in part because of Buffett's inability to make a major acquisition, a significant reason Berkshire ended 2018 with $111.9 billion of cash and equivalents.
In the interview, Buffett ""waved off"" the idea of paying a shareholder dividend.
He also lamented the prospect of a time when Berkshire's stock traded at a fair price, and other companies and stocks also looked expensive. ""That's my nightmare,"" he said.
Berkshire's market value is more than $520 billion, based on reported shares outstanding.
Buffett, 88, has run Berkshire since 1965, and has not publicly signaled any intention to stop.

""I have more fun here than I think any 88-year-old is having, virtually, in the world,"" he said in the interview from Berkshire's headquarters.

76,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 05:29PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Intel’s Guidance Will Hamper Stocks
The Nasdaq and the Dow will face some headwinds from chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after its shares plunged after hours following weak guidance.
Intel topped first-quarter estimates, but for the second quarter it said it expects to earn 89 cents a share on revenue of $15.6 billion. The projection compares with an estimate of $1.02 from S&P Capital IQ and a revenue estimate of $16.88 billion.
Fellow semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) also fell postmarket.
Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a quarterly profit the blew away forecasts, with sales in line.
But cautious guidance kept the stock from really rallying in after-hours trading.
2. First Glimpse at Q1 GDP
Amid all the intrigue about earnings, there’s a big economic report out before the bell tomorrow.
The government will release its first measure of first-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect that GDP rose at an annual rate of 2% in the first three months of the year, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would be down from the final measure of fourth-quarter economic growth, which came in at 2.2%, but would indicate momentum in the latter part of the first quarter following the partial government shutdown.
Looking to inflation, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices, which exclude food and energy, are forecast to have risen 1.3%, down from 1.8% in the fourth quarter.
3. Big Reports From Big Oil
Friday gives investors a break. They don’t have to think much about bank or tech earnings.
What they do get to think about is Big Oil with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) both reporting before the open in an environment of sharply higher oil prices.
ExxonMobil is expected to report 72 cents a share in earnings, down from $1.09 a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Revenue is projected at $69.47 billion, up 1.86%.
Exxon is making a big investment push this year, with spending in the Permian Basin of West Texas and in Guyana in South America and an expansion in Beaumont, Tex. to make its refinery the nation’s largest. It’s also building a petrochemical complex near Corpus Christi. The stock is up about 21% this year after falling 18.5% in 2018.
Chevron is expected to earn $1.28 a share, down from $1.90 a year ago. Revenue is expected to be flat at $37.84 billion. Shares are up 8.4%.
Chevron has offered to buy oil-and-gas producer Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) for $33 billion in cash and stock, but the bid was topped this week by Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which offered $38 billion.
Consumer products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) also reports before the open.
Analysts estimate the maker of Colgate toothpaste, Ajax cleaners, Murphy’s Oil Soap and related products will report earnings of 66 cents a share, down 11% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.87 billion would be down 3.3% from a year ago.
Companies like Colgate-Palmolive and archrival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) face pricing pressures. A rising U.S. dollar doesn’t help either. The shares, however, are up more than 15% this year.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is expected to report earnings of 52 cents a share, down from 75 cents a share last year. Revenue is projected at $10.61 billion, up 1.9% from a year ago.
Watch for how the company discusses the impact of higher fuel prices on results. As important is how much the grounding of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jetliners will affect results going forward.
Among companies also reporting on Friday are  Weyerhaeuser  (NYSE:WY), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM),  Goodyear Tire  & Rubber (NASDAQ:GT) and  Sony  (NYSE:SNE).
Tech comes back next week with Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reporting after Monday’s close and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after Tuesday’s finish."

The S&P 500 slipped 0.04%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.21%. But the Dow fell 0.51%, with manufacturing giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) accounting for the bulk of the losses.
3M reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and downgraded guidance for full-year earnings as weakness in automotive and electronics markets as well as China hurt performance. Its shares slumped 13%, dragging the broader industrials sector lower.
 United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) also delivered a blow, closing 8% lower, after missing estimates from Investing.com on both the top and bottom lines. Rival shipping company FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell 4%.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), meanwhile, surged 3%, taking its market cap above $1 trillion, as the tech giant reported blowout first-quarter results that also beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed 4% lower after it reported an adjusted loss of $2.90 a share for the first quarter, wider than the 69 cents a share loss expected, with revenue also missing estimates.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, ended the day roughly unchanged as U.S. oil prices fell 1% a day after the Energy Information Administration reported a larger-than-expected build in domestic crude supplies.
Homebuilders were also pressured. DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) fell after its better-than-expected quarterly results were offset by its gloomy outlook on revenue.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) also closed lower.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed just barely lower on Thursday, as a dive in industrial stocks and concerns about slowing global growth eclipsed gains in Facebook and Microsoft.
The industrials sector fell 1.99% with hefty drags from 3M (NYSE:MMM),  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co after they reported disappointing results. Fedex Corp also slumped after UPS's profit miss.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares were up 1.7% after the market closed after the company reported a first-quarter profit that topped estimates, although its second-quarter revenue forecast was largely below expectations.  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) shares fell 7% after the chip maker forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates. But shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) both jumped, rising 5.8% and 3.3%, respectively, after they reported better-than-expected results.
""Sentiment is fluctuating as a result of mixed messages from earnings and data. We're going to continue to see fluctuations because we're likely to continue to see mixed messages,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. She also cited high U.S. jobless claims and an unexpected shrinking of the South Korean economy.
While expectations for aggregate S&P first-quarter earnings improved, investors kept a wary eye on future reports, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
""Second-quarter estimates continue to be reduced. That's telling you there's a lot of caution. That's coming from corporate management teams as they provide guidance and the market is following their lead,"" Bell said. ""We're still in a wait-and-see mode regarding the direction of the economy so nobody's willing to go all out in the market right now especially with valuations at a premium."" 
The S&P 500 has rallied 17% so far this year, rebounding from a late-2018 slump, on hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal, the Federal Reserve's move to pause interest rate hikes and some better-than-expected earnings reports.
The index ended the day 0.5% below its late September record high. It has struggled to break above that level as investors await more positive catalysts.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 134.97 points, or 0.51%, to 26,462.08, the S&P 500 lost 1.08 points, or 0.04%, to 2,926.17, and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.67 points, or 0.21%, to 8,118.68.
Refinitiv data through Thursday morning showed that Wall Street now expects S&P 500 first-quarter earnings to be level with the year-ago quarter, a sharp improvement from the 1.1% decline expected just on Wednesday, and better than the 2% fall expected at the start of April. Excluding energy, the growth rate would climb to 1.4%. 
Gains in social media company Facebook lifted the communication services index 1%, making it the second biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors. Healthcare stocks rose 1.1%. 
But 3M fell almost 13% in its biggest one-day percentage drop in more than three decades, after it cut its 2019 earnings view and announced plans to lay off 2,000 workers. It was the biggest decline since Oct. 19, 1987, when it dropped 20.3% in a broad market crash. 
 Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) was the S&P's biggest percentage decliner, falling 17.1% after the chipmaker's quarterly gross margins fell short of estimates. The Philadelphia chip index dropped 1.8%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 56 new highs and 58 new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges 6.64 billion shares changed hands, in line with the 6.64 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will pay $150 million to settle charges it misled two large California public pension funds about the risks of mortgage-backed securities they bought in the years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The settlement announced on Thursday by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra resolves an April 2016 lawsuit filed by his predecessor Kamala Harris, who is now a U.S. senator.
Becerra said the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) will receive $122 million from the settlement, while the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) will receive $8 million. The other $20 million will cover costs and help fund other investigations.
Morgan Stanley denied wrongdoing. A spokesman said the accord is the New York-based bank's last regulatory settlement related to the financial crisis.
California said Morgan Stanley overstated the quality of subprime loans from lenders such as New Century Financial, which went bankrupt in 2007, that it bundled into seemingly safe securities that CalPERS and CalSTRS bought from 2003 to 2007.
The bank was also accused of failing to remove poor-quality loans from those securities, and hiding the risks because disclosure could become a ""relationship killer"" prompting lenders to send future business elsewhere.
""Morgan Stanley lied about the risks of its products and put profits over teachers and public employees who relied on its advice,"" Becerra said.

The lawsuit was one of hundreds accusing banks of misleading investors in the marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities. Morgan Stanley agreed in February 2016 to pay $3.2 billion to resolve federal and state claims over those securities.

In a Tuesday television address, Maduro referred to a ""$1.3 billion robbery and embezzlement,"" without specifying which deal he was referring to.
In its statement, Citgo - now controlled by a board named by opposition leader Juan Guaido - said a $1.2 billion term loan issued on March 28 was ""marketed through an open and competitive process"" and was also in compliance with ""U.S. Government sanctions."" 
Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, invoked the country's constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. He has been recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by most Western countries, including the United States.

GM has been taking political heat from the likes of President Donald Trump and Democratic candidates to challenge him, including former Vice President Joe Biden, over plans to stop production at four U.S. plants by early next year. GM’s Chevrolet Cruze factory in Lordstown, Ohio, which is about 500 miles from the Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, stopped operating in March.
All 3,000 workers who will be displaced from their current jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio due to the restructuring will be offered transfers to other GM plants, Morrissey said. The Corvette plant probably will be able to fill all 400 jobs with transferring workers, he said.
UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who has publicly criticized GM for not adding new products to Lordstown and three other plants, commended the automaker for adding work at the Corvette plant.
“We hope to see more of this in the future from GM, which is good for our members, their families, the community, and all of America,” Dittes said.
The new Corvette will be the eighth generation of the famed sports car, which began in 1953.

The probe comes after the London-listed company was subpoenaed last year by the U.S. Justice department for documents relating to its dealings in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela since 2007.
Glencore said Thursday that the CFTC had notified it of investigations into whether the company and its subsidiaries ""may have violated certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and/or CFTC Regulations through corrupt practices in connection with commodities.""
The company said it believes the CFTC’s investigations ""have a similar scope in terms of subject matter"" to the DOJ probe, which became public last July.
The commodity trading industry is facing a multitude of bribery and corruption investigations in jurisdictions ranging from Brazil to the U.S., drawing comparisons with the early 1980s when Glencore’s founder Marc Rich was prosecuted for tax evasion.
The director of enforcement at the CFTC said last month in a speech that the agency was investigating overseas fraud and manipulation under the Commodities Exchange Act.
""Companies and individuals engaging in foreign corrupt practices should recognize that this sort of misconduct might constitute fraud, manipulation, false reporting, or a number of other types of violations under the CEA, and thus be subject to enforcement actions brought by the CFTC,"" James McDonald said in New Orleans.
Glencore’s shares have declined about 8 percent since the DOJ started is investigation last year, even as most miners gained. Investor sentiment is still negative regarding Glencore, analysts at Jefferies LLC noted last week."

""As a result of the notice of strike from the pilots' union in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, SAS is taking precautionary measures to protect travelers and staff,"" it said in a statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""This means that a number of flights will be canceled to avoid stranded travelers and crews,"" it said.
Swedish, Danish and Norwegian pilot unions earlier this month called a strike if there was no agreement on wages and other terms after an earlier round of talks broke down without the parties finding common ground. 

National mediators in the three countries have been trying to broker a deal since last week between delegations of the two parties. SAS spokeswoman Freja Annamatz said negotiations were still ongoing.

94,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",France's RTE urges policymakers to talk energy mix with EU peers,"By Bate Felix
PARIS (Reuters) - National decisions to shut down power generation capacity without wider co-ordination with other European states could put the continent's electricity system at risk, the president of France's RTE grid operator said on Thursday.
Since 2012, several countries have announced plans to close some coal, nuclear, or oil generators to curb carbon emissions, reduce the share of nuclear in the energy mix like in France, or phase out atomic energy like Germany and Belgium.
Francois Brottes said energy policy decisions made at a national level were having a continent-wide impact as countries increasingly depend on electricity imports from elsewhere in Europe to meet shortfalls, particularly during peak demand periods. 
""Countries are making decisions about their electricity production capacity, such as closing down coal or nuclear, without always talking to one another,"" Brottes told Reuters. 
""We are warning decision-makers that they are making decisions without consulting each other on the evolution of their energy mix,"" he said.
Counting on power interconnectors to import from other countries is no longer enough, Brottes said, citing the example of Belgium, which faced an unprecedented shortfall last winter.
Brottes said 15 European power network operators have signed a joint declaration to alert policymakers and highlight the risks ahead of European elections in May.
""We are in charge of making sure there are no blackouts, but we are not in charge of generation. We do not control production,"" Brottes said.
During a parliamentary hearing on April 9, Brottes told lawmakers that French electricity production has been hurt by its aging power plants, and the closure of around 13 gigawatts (GW) of thermal generation since 2012. 
He said the margin of maneuver for transmission system operators was fast reducing. 
France has 11 GW of interconnection with other European neighbors, but the capacity is never at a hundred percent because neighbors may need to use their generation capacity to meet their own needs during peak demand periods.
The planned closure of France's oldest nuclear plant in Fessenheim and its remaining coal power plants by 2022 mean 18 GW of generation will be gone, Brottes said during the hearing. New generation capacity was not being added at the same pace.
""Our neighbors are facing the same problem,"" he said during the hearing. 
Britain has cut its power generation by 13 GW since 2012, and will close its coal power plants by 2025, while Germany plans to reduce its lignite power generation by 15 GW by 2025.
Italy plans to curb oil-fired generators by 15 GW by 2025, and Spain plans to close all its coal-fired power plants by 2030. The plants generated 13 percent of its electricity in 2018. 
""It is easier to make decisions over capacity shutdown than to start up more generation capacity,"" added Brottes.
France, which plans to cut the share of nuclear generation in the electricity mix to 50 percent by 2035 from 75 percent today, was still lagging its European peers in developing renewables, although it was growing, he said.
Offshore wind projects that were announced in 2012 are still being held back by court appeals against the projects. 
Utility EDF's Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor, currently under construction, could face new delays, while a gas power plant is also facing opposition, he said. 

Brottes said the power system operators were calling for prudence and pragmatism.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 02:11PM ET</span>","U.S. FAA, global aviation regulators to meet May 23 on Boeing 737 MAX","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it is inviting top civil aviation officials from around the world to a May 23 meeting to discuss the now-grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
The aircraft has been involved in two deadly crashes since October. The FAA said the meeting ""is intended to provide participants the FAA’s safety analysis that will inform its decision to return the 737 MAX fleet to service in the U.S. when it is made.""
The FAA, which did not disclose where the meeting will take place, said that at the May 23 meeting it will ""provide safety experts to answer any questions participants have related to their respective decisions to return the fleet to service."" It will not include Boeing at the meeting.
The meeting is separate from a joint governmental review of the Boeing 737 MAX led by the FAA that will begin on April 29 and will include nine other aviation regulators from around the world. The FAA has said a decision on when to unground the plane is separate from that joint review. 
Boeing has announced a planned software update on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system known as MCAS that is under scrutiny following the two disastrous nose-down crashes. It has not yet submitted the software to the FAA for formal approval.
Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said last week the manufacturer is making “steady progress” on the path to certifying a software update to the grounded 737 MAX and has made the final test flight before a certification flight.
The FAA said this month it was forming an international team to review the safety of the aircraft, grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - that killed nearly 350 people.
China, the European Aviation Safety Agency, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates will all take part in the review set to last 90 days, the FAA said.
The review is chaired by former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Chris Hart and is comprised of a team of experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities. The group will conduct a comprehensive review of the certification of the aircraft’s automated flight control system.

American Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co have canceled flights into August as a result of the grounding.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>","After years serving CEOs, Goldman's Ayco also wants other workers","By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is expanding a financial advisory service for top executives to target millions of other affluent employees at some of the biggest U.S. companies, as it seeks to build its retail and wealth management businesses.
Goldman's Ayco unit provides high-end tax and wealth advice to top executives at some 400 companies, including 60 Fortune 100 companies. According to the bank's estimates these firms employ at least 8 million people and Goldman now wants them as clients, too. 
Goldman began rolling out a new Ayco personal finance website for rank-and-file workers in October and has so far signed up 70 companies. By the end of 2019, the bank hopes to have signed up around 100 companies, which employ 2 million employees, Larry Restieri, the unit's chief executive, said in an interview this month. 
In recent weeks, it has also started pitching high-yield savings accounts and personal loans from its online bank Marcus through the Ayco website, Restieri added.
The rollout is the latest effort of the Wall Street trading and advisory firm to reposition itself as a traditional bank. 
Goldman seeks to reach a wider customer base. Its trading business has been shrinking. In the first quarter, the bank's corporate clients helped it grow mergers and acquisitions revenue but overall revenue slumped.
Chief Executive David Solomon must deliver on a target of $5 billion in new annual revenue by 2020 or risk getting squeezed by rival behemoths like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) . [https://tmsnrt.rs/2H81K9a]
The bank took its first step toward that goal with the creation of Marcus in 2016. In March, Goldman announced a co-branded credit card with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which will connect it to hundreds of millions of iPhone users.
Expanding Ayco is the next step into the $9 trillion U.S. mass affluent customer market and offers the bank an opportunity to gain new clients cheaply. 
The primary cost to the bank - developing the online platform - will be offset by fees companies will pay to offer the service to their workers, Goldman executives said. 
Some investors fret Goldman is expanding into an area where it has little experience. They worry the bank is making $40,000 personal loans and extending credit card debt to iPhone users when the economy is showing signs of slowing.
Goldman thinks otherwise. Executives there say the Ayco expansion is part of a bigger plan, culminating with the launch of a retail wealth management offering later this year.
Restieri said it is too early to put numbers on the contribution the expanded Ayco could make toward Goldman's $5 billion goal. 
In November, the bank said that it was halfway toward meeting that target and that Ayco, along with private wealth management and asset management, had so far contributed $400 million. 
ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE
Ayco's website, called Financial Wellness, starts with an online questionnaire. Employees of corporate clients such as Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc answer questions like, ""Do you generally live within your means?"" and ""Do you have an emergency fund?""
After workers answer questions about their savings, credit card debt, student loans and other finances, Ayco offers what it calls solutions such as Marcus savings accounts, personal loans or products from other financial institutions.
Adoption rates are a question. One company that offered a financial incentive got as much as 60 percent of its employees to use Financial Wellness. Others have seen lower pick-up rates.
But as Ayco rolls out its mass-market offering, Restieri thinks it will benefit from brand cachet of having already served the bosses.

""When this offering is presented to employees, the top C-suite of those companies would have already been using us for 10-15 years,"" Restieri said.

Horton fell sharply on Thursday after its better-than-expected quarterly results were offset by pessimistic outlook on revenues.
DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) said it expects revenue between $16.7 billion and $17 billion, below Capital IQ's consensus of $17.2 billion, sending its share price more than 4% lower. The shares had reached a 52-week high of $47.02 on Wednesday before falling back. They're still up 25% year-to-date.
D.R. Horton reported earnings of $0.93 a share for the quarter on revenue of $4.13 billion, beating estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $0.87 on revenue of $4.04 billion.
The above-consensus report was supported by an uptick in the number of homes delivered in the quarter.
The company delivered 13,480 homes for the quarter, up 10% from a year earlier. Net sales for orders rose to 16,805 homes valued at $4.9 billion from 15,828 homes valued at $4.7 billion a year earlier and ahead of expectations for 16,695 homes.
D.R. Horton said it expects to deliver between 55,000 homes and 56,000 homes in 2019, above Wedbush Securities' forecast for 54,000 homes.
Some on Wall Street, however, appear willing to give the homebuilder the benefit of the doubt.
""Unlike more diversified builders, DHI has a strong presence with affordable communities and a large land inventory,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider with a strong buy rating on the stock.
""As a conservative operator, we believe DHI will manage pace and price, and it has ample land to match the higher pace of demand for entry level homes.""
Still, Horton's subdued outlook on full-year revenue triggered a selloff across homebuilders as  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) fell sharply, pressuring the SPDR S&P Homebuilders (NYSE:XHB) ETF 0.9% lower."

(Reuters) - Shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co fell 11 percent on Thursday after the U.S. manufacturing conglomerate cut its 2019 earnings forecast and said it would lay off 2,000 workers, citing worsening performance in high-growth markets such as China.
The stock's worst day in more than three decades dragged down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and added to the gloom across the manufacturing sector following bleak results from  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). 
3M, which makes everything from adhesive tapes to air filters, said the dismal performance in the first three months of 2019 was caused by weak demand in the China automotive and electronics sectors, causing it to cut production.
""We didn't respond aggressively enough to what we were seeing. And so, we're behind the curve,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said on a post earnings call with analysts.
Roman added that the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape was slow to align its spending with reduced output, and this dented margins.
An analyst on the call peppered management with questions on Roman's management style and asked if 3M needed to change its incentives or compensation schemes to get its leaders to adapt faster to the changing macro economy.
""We're going to take stock of what we're doing, how we're doing it, and compensation is an important piece and we look at that as well,"" Roman said.
3M's shares have underperformed peers such as Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) since Roman took the helm in July last year, with the stock rising 11.4 percent, compared with a 24 percent gain for Honeywell. 
""Since the prior CEO stepped down, 3M has really not performed anywhere close to its industrial peers,"" Melius Research analyst Scott Davis told CNBC.
The results come a day after heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc flagged tepid sales in its construction equipment business in the Asia-Pacific region, pointing to subdued growth in China.
After a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter, China's economy unexpectedly grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, but analysts cautioned that it was too early to call a sustainable turnaround.
Sales in Asia-Pacific, 3M's biggest market outside the United States, fell 7.4 percent, while Europe, Middle East and Africa reported declines of 9.4 percent. Sales in the United States rose just 0.1 percent.
""The only positive that may come out today for the stock is that one of the sell-side bulls may downgrade, as even the most disingenuous analyst has to admit a change in thesis,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note.
3M now expects 2019 adjusted earnings between $9.25 and $9.75 per share, versus its prior forecast of $10.45 to $10.90.

The job cuts would result in an estimated annual pre-tax savings range of $225 million to $250 million, with $100 million in the remainder of 2019, the company said in a statement https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190425005428/en/3M-Reports-First-Quarter-2019-Results-Company-Initiates.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",Latest subpoena sours Chipotle's quarterly beat,"(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) said on Thursday it received another subpoena from U.S. federal prosecutors, seeking information related to an outbreak that left hundreds of people sick last year in one of its Ohio restaurant.
Shares of the burrito chain fell 5 percent following the disclosure and after analysts said they see limited valuation even as the company posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit on Wednesday. 
""Its not a new incident but (the subpoena) is enough to shake off some of the more skittish bulls on the story,"" said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson. 
Over the past three years, the company has faced a number of subpoenas regarding sicknesses linked to its restaurants following an E. Coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks at the company's outlets dating back to late 2015 that affected hundreds across several states.
The latest subpoena is the fourth and is part of an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Central District of California.
Last August, a type of bacteria found in meat and pre-cooked food left at unsafe temperatures was responsible for making hundreds of people ill in a Powell, Ohio restaurant.
The subpoena, disclosed https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058090/000105809019000015/cmg-20190331x10q.htm in a regulatory filing on Thursday, sought information related to the incidents of illnesses associated with the Ohio restaurant and restaurants in California, Massachusetts, and Virginia, that were covered under previous subpoenas.
Wednesday's results follow Chipotle's efforts in ramping up promotions, adding new menu items, and extending its delivery options. It also launched a loyalty program to attract customers.
The upbeat results also prompted the company to raise its full-year comparable sales growth forecast to mid-to-high-single-digit, from the prior expectations of mid-single-digit growth.
""While the company upgraded their comp outlook, we believe Chipotle needs to continue to hit double-digit comps to justify the current multiple,"" said Mizuho Securities analyst Jeremy Scott.
Chipotle trades 52.18 times its 12-month forward earnings, while Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) trades at 26.07 times and McDonalds's trades 23.74 times. 
Analysts also highlighted that higher commodity costs, loyalty redemptions, and rising food costs would hurt Chipotle's margins.
Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said Chipotle is well-positioned with its initiatives and believes it is still in the early innings of its transition process. 

""However, valuation keeps us at 'hold'(rating),"" he added.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 12:11PM ET</span>",Floods stall fertilizer shipments in latest blow to U.S. farmers,"By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farm supplier CHS Inc has dozens of loaded barges trapped on the flood-swollen Mississippi River near St. Louis - about 500 miles from the company's two Minnesota distribution hubs.
The barges can't move - or get crucial nutrients to corn farmers for the spring planting season - because river locks on the main U.S. artery for grain and fertilizer have been shuttered for weeks. High water presents a hazard for boats, barges and lock equipment.
Railroads have also been plagued by delays from winter weather and flooding in the western Midwest, further disrupting agricultural supply chains in the nation's bread basket.
The transportation woes are the latest headache for a U.S. agricultural sector reeling from years of slumping profits and the U.S.-China trade war, and they threaten to cut the number of acres of corn and wheat that can be planted this year.
The shipping delays follow months of bad weather in the rural Midwest, including a ""bomb cyclone"" that flooded at least 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) of farmland last month and a record-breaking April snow storm.
""Our barges are a long way from where we need them in the upper Midwest,"" said Gary Halvorson, senior vice president of agronomy at CHS. ""We really don't think that any rail line will be at their preferred service rate until summer."" 
Agricultural retailers rely on barges and trains to resupply distribution warehouses across the farm belt. But river flooding has delayed the seasonal reopening of the northern reaches of the Mississippi River to barge traffic. The latest National Weather Service river forecasts suggest one of the river's southernmost locks could remain closed until at least the first week of May.
FALLING PROFITS, PRODUCTION
Reduced or poorly timed fertilizer applications can hurt yields, potentially denting this year's U.S. farm profits, which are already predicted to be about half of their 2013 peak, according to the latest U.S. government forecast. Delayed shipments can also mean lost sales for farm suppliers and higher demurrage penalties, or late-return charges, on stalled barges and rail cars.
CHS, one of the largest publicly traded U.S. agriculture suppliers, said this month cited poor weather as a key reason for a $8.9 million drop in agricultural profits during its fiscal second quarter.
Agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co said severe weather and flooding would cut its first-quarter profit by $50 million to $60 million while DowDuPont said flooding would slash first-quarter profits in its agriculture division by 25 percent.
Fertilizer producers such as Nutrien Ltd, Mosaic Co and Yara International also lost sales due to bad weather in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year. Mosaic announced last month that it would cut U.S. phosphate fertilizer production by 300,000 tonnes for the spring season due to poor weather and large inventories left over from the fall.
Farm retailers such as CHS and privately held Growmark may see additional losses through the spring season as the tighter planting window limits the application services they provide, according to CoBank analyst Will Secor.
SCRAMBLING TO PROTECT CROP YIELDS
Farmers are not expected to skip nitrogen fertilizer applications entirely, which would cause yields to drop by about half, according to Purdue University agronomist Bob Nielsen. But higher nutrient costs could have growers applying less-than-optimal amounts.
Some farmers could shift from corn to soybeans, which can be planted later and require fewer fertilizer applications. But soybeans will continue to face uncertain demand as long as the U.S. and top buyer China remain locked in a trade war.
""Right now my plan is to plant more corn because the price of beans is so low,"" said Don Batie, a farmer near Lexington, Nebraska. 
The weather problems started last autumn, a period when some farmers treat fields after harvesting in preparation for the following spring. But wet weather prevented fall fertilizer applications, and an exceptionally snowy winter in many areas slowed or halted winter field work. 
More recent storms have threatened to narrow the limited spring window for field treatments.
""When you add to it this re-supply constraint of not being able to move barges up the Mississippi, it puts us in a precarious position,"" said Kreg Ruhl, manager for crop nutrients division at Growmark, the country's third-largest agriculture retailer in terms of revenue.
PRICES RISING
Retail fertilizer prices have started rising in parts of the Midwest and are likely to rise further as local supplies are depleted and retailers scramble to resupply.
In Iowa, the top U.S. corn producing state, the price of the common fertilizer urea was up 20 percent in late April from a year ago, and anhydrous ammonia was up 27 percent. Both hit their highest early spring levels in three years, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
Without timely barge deliveries, CHS will lean on its rail network that brings imported supplies from Galveston, Texas, to any of the 29 rail hubs it owns in places like Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Marshall, Minnesota; and Minot, North Dakota.
Higher U.S. fertilizer prices and strong demand from other countries could help producers such as Nutrien, Mosaic and Yara recover some recent profit weakness in upcoming quarters. 
For farmers and fertilizer retailers, however, uncertain fertilizer deliveries will likely weigh on agricultural markets through the planting season.

""We're doing our very best to make sure that our retail network is supplied,"" said CHS's Halvorson.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>","Southwest Airlines says bookings strong, may not always be 737-only carrier","By Tracy Rucinski and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co forecast better-than-expected second-quarter revenue growth on Thursday, citing demand from leisure and business customers, even as the low-cost carrier is forced to cancel flights due to the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets. 
No. 4 U.S. airline Southwest, which currently uses only Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 narrowbody aircraft, suggested on Thursday that it may consider mixing up its fleet in the future.
""We're an all-Boeing 737 carrier,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told CNBC. ""That doesn't mean that we’ll be an all-737 carrier into perpetuity."" 
It is not the first time Southwest has hinted about fleet changes, which could benefit Boeing's European rival Airbus, but such a decision would mean abandoning Southwest's long-held practice of flying only one type of jet, which reduces maintenance and pilot training costs.
Another option would be to add a different Boeing model. ""It makes more sense to ease into any transition with the same manufacturer,"" one source familiar with Southwest's thinking told Reuters.
The company's costs are already under scrutiny by analysts. Unit costs, or total operating expenses per available seat mile, rose 6.5 percent on an adjusted basis in the first quarter and are expected to increase by 10.5 percent to 12.5 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, it said.
Dallas-based Southwest said it lost more than $200 million in revenue during the first quarter after canceling more than 10,000 flights because of the partial U.S. government shutdown, winter storms, maintenance disruptions and the worldwide MAX grounding.
Still, the company said it expected closely watched unit revenue to grow by 5.5 percent to 5.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. It reported only 2.7 percent growth in the first-quarter.
Its shares rose 2.8 percent in early trading.
Southwest reported first-quarter net profit of $387 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $463 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 
That beat Wall Street's average estimate of 61 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts cut their estimates sharply in late March after regulators around the world grounded Boeing's 737 MAX jets following two fatal crashes.
Southwest has said its 34 737 MAX aircraft represent less than 5 percent of daily flights on its fleet of 753 aircraft.
Total operating revenue at the airline, which launched a service to Hawaii from California last month, rose 4 percent to $5.15 billion.

The low-cost carrier has removed the fuel-efficient, longer-range MAX from its flying schedule through Aug. 5 as it waits for Boeing to submit a software fix and new training guidelines to global regulators for review.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 11:24AM ET</span>","Bombardier shares sink 15% after forecasts cut for profit, revenue","By Arathy S Nair and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier Inc cut its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday due to delivery delays and production challenges at some projects of its key railcar-making unit, and shares sank 25 percent in early trading before paring some of those losses.
The cuts to its forecasts come as the plane-and-train maker nears the end of a 5-year turnaround plan, after heavy investment in plane production drove the company to the brink of bankruptcy in 2015.
Shares erased some of their earlier losses to trade down 15% at C$2.46 by midmorning, with the company still the biggest loser on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the most active stock.
Montreal-based Bombardier trimmed its 2019 revenue estimate by $1 billion to $17 billion, and expected adjusted core earnings to range between $1.50 billion and $1.65 billion, compared with its prior expectation of $1.65 billion to $1.8 billion. 
""This is not great news, but this is not like 'the end of the world' news,"" said William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann.
Bombardier has been dogged by a handful of rail contracts in its $34 billion backlog that generated a disappointing free cash flow result in 2018 and subsequent selloff of Bombardier stocks and bonds. 
The company has since made progress on a project in New York City, where deliveries resumed after being temporarily halted for poor performance.
But in a separate contract, Swiss Federal Railways has so far declined to take delivery of more than 12 Bombardier trains in a total order of 62, as those already in service had not yet lived up to expectations.
In January, a Bombardier spokesman told Reuters problems with the Swiss trains would not cause “significant changes” to the company’s working capital outlook and were expected to be resolved within weeks.
A spokesman for Bombardier's Berlin-based rail unit could not be immediately reached on Thursday to comment on the state of these contracts. 
Bombardier cut its full-year revenue forecast by $750 million to about $8.75 billion for its transportation business, which makes rail cars, and by $250 million to $1.15 billion for its commercial aircraft business. 
The company will report first-quarter earnings on May 2.
Bombardier said it expects to deliver only 30 commercial planes in 2019, compared with 35 it had previously forecast, as the planned sale of its Q400 turboprop business is now anticipated to close mid-year. 
The company, however, maintained its earnings forecast for its aerospace business and continues to expect free cash flow to break even, plus or minus $250 million. 
Bombardier also forecast lower-than-expected adjusted core earnings, operating earnings and revenue for the first quarter, due to delayed aircraft deliveries, slower project ramp up at its transportation business and unfavorable currency swings. 
It now expects revenue of about $3.5 billion for the three months through March 31, well below analysts' estimate of $4.03 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Adjusted core earnings of $265 million is expected to miss estimates by 21 percent, while operating earnings of $170 million is set to be 26 percent lower than analysts' estimates, according to the data from Refinitiv. 
Bombardier cut its full-year revenue forecast by $750 million to about $8.75 billion for its transportation business, which makes rail cars, and by $250 million to $1.15 billion for its commercial aircraft business.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 11:22AM ET</span>",RBS begins global hunt for CEO to replace McEwan,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON/EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) is searching for a new chief executive after Ross McEwan resigned, signaling a fresh start as it heads for full private ownership after a state bailout.
New Zealand-born McEwan, who has led RBS since October 2013, has a 12-month notice period and will remain in his position until a successor has been appointed and an orderly handover has taken place, the bank said on Thursday.
RBS chairman Howard Davies said the company had started a worldwide search for a successor, which would include both internal and external candidates.
Davies played down speculation that Alison Rose, the chief executive of RBS's commercial arm and who was recently also promoted to the role of deputy CEO of NatWest, was in pole position for the job, seen as one of the toughest in UK banking.
""There is no favorite, it's an open process and we've only just begun,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of the bank's annual meeting in Edinburgh, adding that headhunter Spencer Stewart had been appointed to assist the search.
McEwan told reporters that he felt it was the right time to leave after turning around the bank's once-dire finances, resulting in two consecutive years of profit and the restoration of dividend payments a decade after the financial crisis.
McEwan remains undecided on his next move but has not ruled out taking another role in finance.
""We'll keep our connections up here (in Britain). Our daughter and her husband and our grandson will be staying up here. Our other daughter will be heading back down. 
""So to be honest we haven't made any calls on what we'll do next. I don’t think you can do that when you’re sitting in a job like this,"" he said.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
McEwan said his ""only regret"" was falling short on targets to improve RBS's customer service, with the bank languishing toward the bottom of customer satisfaction tables.
But the bank remains 62 percent owned by the UK government more than 10 years after its 45 billion pounds taxpayer rescue at the peak of the 2008 credit crunch and is still fighting to restore its public image after a series of crisis-era scandals.
Executives at the shareholder meeting faced fresh complaints over executive pay and alleged mistreatment of troubled borrowers by its controversial Global Restructuring Group.
Despite being among the lowest in Britain's banking sector, salary and bonus payments earned by the 61-year old have attracted considerable scrutiny, particularly in the years before RBS returned to profit.
McEwan's total remuneration was 3.58 million pounds in 2018, 97 times the pay of the bank's median employee and 143 times its lowest paid staff.
Under his watch, the bank also shelled out $4.9 billion to settle its largest-ever regulatory penalty for misselling of high-risk mortgage backed securities between 2005 and 2008, when it was one of the world's biggest banks by assets.
The shareholder meeting was also targeted by climate change activists carrying banners saying ""Fossil Banks, No thanks"" in an echo of the Extinction Rebellion protest which focused on the City of London earlier on Thursday.
LEADERSHIP
McEwan's departure is the second major change in RBS's senior executive team in fewer than six months following the appointment of Katie Murray as the bank's chief financial officer last December.
If Rose, a 20-year veteran of the bank, should succeed McEwan, RBS would become the first British bank to have two women in its highest ranking roles at the same time.
There had been speculation about McEwan's future since finance chief and fellow New Zealander Ewen Stevenson announced he was leaving last May.
Some analysts suggested the CEO's departure might not be ideal timing for the bank, just months before Brexit and with dark clouds looming over the UK housing market.
Shares in the bank were trading down 2.7 percent to 249.7 pence by 1500 GMT.
""We are disappointed by this news. RBS's key financial target is delivery of 12 percent-plus ""all-in"" return on tangible equity next year, that is by any stretch demanding,"" analysts at KBW said in a note.
""Ross was adamant that the target would be delivered. Without his drive, the question must be far more open.""
McEwan received warm praise from his chairman Davies but not all investors were impressed by his legacy.
Retail investor George Fraser told Reuters his RBS shares were decimated by the financial crisis and he was indifferent to the CEO's departure despite better results of late.
""If I'm playing with Andy Murray in doubles you'll know he's the one carrying me - but in a board you're not always sure.
""I don't think the shares will recover in my lifetime that's for sure.""

117,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>","Drugmakers Astellas, Amgen to pay $125 million in U.S. charity kickback probe","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Two drugmakers will pay nearly $125 million to settle claims they used charities that help cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket drug costs as a way to pay kickbacks aimed at encouraging the use of their medications, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.
The department said Astellas Pharma and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) were the latest pharmaceutical companies to settle claims stemming from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers' financial support of patient assistance charities.
Astellas will pay $100 million while Amgen will pay $24.75 million, the department said. Neither company admitted wrongdoing or responded immediately to requests for comment.
The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, came amid growing attention to soaring U.S. drug prices. Copays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a drug’s cost.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing copayments for patients enrolled in the government’s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing copay assistance as long as they are independent.

But the government alleged that the drugmakers used such charities as conduits to improperly pay the copay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",New capital for Tesla will come at a cost,"(Reuters) - A capital raise for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will not come cheap and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk must finally prove to investors that he can produce and deliver Model 3s and higher margin electric cars on time, Wall Street analysts said on Thursday. 
After unveiling a $700 million loss in the first quarter, Musk conceded on Wednesday evening that he needed to pull in more capital for the car world's highest profile venture of recent years.
Seven Wall Street brokerages asked by Reuters said they expected Musk to tap investors for between $1 billion and $3 billion in the near future. 
The results also stressed the company's paying off of $920 million in existing debt in the first quarter, but bond yields in the company surged on the news, while shares fell, as investors began to price in what that might cost. 
In European trading before the start of the U.S. business day, investors were already demanding a record risk premium for holding Tesla's $1.8 billion junk bond, pushing the yield on the 5.3 percent note due in August 2025 to the highest in six months at 8.51 percent. 
Tesla shares, already down more than 20 percent this year, dipped 1.4 percent to $255.13 in early trade. 
After months of uncertainty following Musk's swiftly retracted claim last summer that he was set to take the company private, and a series of failures to meet production targets, they said the cost of new capital would now be far higher than a year ago.
""Obviously, investors would have appreciated that confession (to raise capital) when the shares were higher, the fundamental performance better and Elon Musk less erratic,"" Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note. 
Tesla's first quarter results disappointed both in terms of sales and a sharp drop in the number of vehicles delivered to global customers, and there was scepticism over promises of a return to profitability in the third quarter.
""Ultimately we believe the company's guidance is aggressive,"" analysts from Wedbush Securities said in a note to clients.
Musk has long resisted the need to raise capital, but he told a conference call with analysts it was now the right time.
Several analysts covering the company argued Tesla needed to simplify operations. 
""For investors we think the question is whether or not people want to put capital into Tesla for Robo taxis and autonomous when Uber (NYSE:UBER) or  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) or Nvidia could end up being better alternatives,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin wrote.
""We don't think Tesla would need to raise capital as urgently if they weren't spending so much money on these initiatives outside of their core mission of producing awesome EV's"".

CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said Tesla's timing – with the stock down more than 22 percent year-to-date – is quite inopportune to raise capital and that Tesla should have completed an equity issuance months ago.

121,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>",Argentine Bonds Sink Into Distressed Territory as Macri Falters,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina’s bonds tumbled for a second day, sending an implied probability-of-default gauge over 60 percent and rattling the resolve of investors who want to believe President Mauricio Macri will fend off his populist foes and win re-election this year.
Argentina is once again feeling the pain of being considered one of the riskiest credits in emerging markets despite progress on a fiscal deficit and a record credit line from the International Monetary Fund as a strengthening dollar saps demand for high-yielding assets. It comes at a tough time for Macri, who is struggling with sky-high inflation and a recession ahead of October elections which have eroded his public image in polls and led to concerns of a populist comeback by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine debt over U.S. Treasuries has surged 160 basis points this week to 10.08 percentage points, surpassing the threshold where a credit is considered distressed. Dollar bonds lost 4.5 percent on Wednesday alone, bringing year-to-date returns to a 3 percent loss against average gains of 6.6 percent for developing nation peers. The first bond maturing after the election, in April of 2021, has tumbled 9 cents this week and now yields 20 percent.
In comments on Wednesday, Macri admitted that the market volatility is stemming from the political uncertainty but said he believes it’s wrong to expect Argentines will elect his political opponents.
“The world isn’t sure whether Argentines want to go back, and that makes the world very concerned -- sovereign risk goes up, they take more defensive positions,” Macri said in a radio interview. “I think they’re wrong, they’re wrong. We Argentines aren’t going back” to the past.
The implied probability of non-payment over the next five years has jumped to 61 percent, according to credit-default swap trading. Just a year ago, that reading was 23 percent. The peso, which was already the worst-performing currency in the world, slipped another 4 percent to 45.78 per dollar, a record low.
The market selloff is exacerbating the situation as rising borrowing costs and a weakening peso translate into higher inflation expectations, eroding support for Macri, JJPMorgan analysts wrote in a note late Wednesday. That “negative feedback loop,” added to worse-than expected inflation, are the main drivers behind Argentina’s dire situation, they added.
“At the current juncture the market seems to be looking for a circuit breaker to that negative feedback loop,” the analysts said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were dashed on Thursday when  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) ended merger talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
Germany's two largest banks announced that nearly six weeks of high-level negotiations about a tie-up had ended in failure, confirming an earlier Reuters report and immediately raising questions about the future of the Frankfurt-based rivals.
The decision to ditch the talks followed a final early morning meeting between Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing and his Commerzbank counterpart Martin Zielke, two sources told Reuters.
Both CEOs said a deal would not have created sufficient benefits to offset the risks and costs of a merger, which had been opposed by unions fearing 30,000 job losses, and raised concerns among investors and regulators.
While the talks are over, investors doubt either bank can go it alone for long under their current strategies given their low levels of profitability.
German government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, had pushed for a tie-up to create a national banking champion and end questions over the future of both banks, which have struggled to recover since the financial crisis. 
Deutsche Bank's 2018 return on equity was just 0.4 percent, trailing far behind rival U.S., and increasingly other European, investment banks, while Zielke said this month that Commerzbank does not have the market share for costly investments, fuelling speculation of an alternative tie-up if talks fell through. 
Shares in Commerzbank were 2.1 percent lower at 1235 GMT. Deutsche Bank traded 0.3 percent lower, erasing earlier gains.
Deutsche Bank will now face pressure to make more radical changes, such as cuts to its U.S. investment bank as advocated by regulators and some major investors. It is already looking at a deal for its asset management unit DWS.
""Deutsche Bank will continue to review all alternatives,"" Germany's largest bank said. 
BIDDERS IN THE WINGS
Employees of both banks immediately welcomed the news, although a senior Commerzbank manager acknowledged it opened the door to further uncertainty as foreign competitors circle.
""It is clear that others will now come out of the woodwork with offers and ideas,"" the manager told Reuters.
Doing nothing is ""not an option"", Zielke has told his staff, 82 percent of whom were against a merger in an internal survey. 
Both UniCredit and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) have expressed interest in Commerzbank, which is Germany's No. 2 lender and 15 percent owned by the government, sources have said. 
UniCredit and ING declined to comment after news that talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank had failed.
Some major Deutsche Bank investors had questioned the deal's logic and were unwilling to stump up any extra cash to get it done, while credit ratings agencies had warned of risks.
The European Central Bank would have asked Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gave the go-ahead for a merger, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. .
The German central bank, which helps oversee the banks, stressed their individual health, calling them sound and stable. 
""This was the case prior to discussions, during discussions and now – without qualification,"" Bundesbank executive board member Joachim Wuermeling said. 
Deutsche Bank also published preliminary earnings in which it said it expects to post a first-quarter net profit of about 200 million euros ($223 million), beating analysts' expectations of 29 million. 
""A merger would have been an enormously complicated and protracted undertaking. In the end, reason has won,"" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, a shareholder in both banks, adding they urgently need to address their strategies.
Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at Union Investment, which also holds shares in Deutsche Bank, said it needs to focus on increasing profitability, especially at its investment bank. 
Deutsche Bank's finance chief James von Moltke told CNBC that the U.S. investment bank is ""a core part of our strategy"".
Gerhard Schick, finance activist at Finanzwende and a former member of the German parliament, welcomed the end of talks but cautioned that Deutsche Bank remains ""too great a risk"".

""The bank is still far too large and would probably have to be rescued in an emergency,"" he said, with reference to the likelihood of Deutsche Bank needing to turn to the state to keep it afloat if it ran into difficulty.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported first-quarter profit on Thursday that beat Wall Street estimates, boosted by strong additions of high-speed internet customers in a quarter that painted another mixed picture for the biggest U.S. cable provider.
The company's shares were up 2.5 percent in premarket trading after falling as much as 3 percent following release of its earnings report. 
Overall revenue missed analyst estimates and Comcast lost more video and phone customers than expected. Revenue from its NBCUniversal cable networks, filmed entertainment and theme parks also fell short of expectations. Earnings per share did, however, exceeded expectations.
Like others in the cable television industry, Comcast is grappling with rival offerings from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube TV and subscription video services like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Earlier this week AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) both reported losing more video customers than analysts expected. 
Philadelphia-based Comcast said it lost 121,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 29,000 it shed last quarter and the 109,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet. In response, the company is striving to build new services on top of its broadband network. 
Revenue from the high-speed internet business climbed 10 percent to $4.58 billion in the first quarter as the company added 375,000 subscribers on a net basis.
Subscriber additions beat the average analyst estimate of 356,000, according to FactSet, but were down slightly from 379,000 in the same period a year earlier.
Comcast is betting that its redesigned Xfinity X1 cable box, which uses a single menu to find content across live TV, on-demand and streaming services like Netflix, will help retain and attract subscribers.
Revenue at its NBCUniversal business, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, dropped 12.5 percent to $8.31 billion.
NBCUniversal plans to launch an advertising-supported TV streaming service in 2020 that will be free for NBCUniversal's pay-TV customers as well as Sky customers internationally.
Filmed entertainment revenue rose 7.4 percent to $1.77 billion, boosted by movies including ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" and ""Us"" while theme park revenue slipped 0.4 percent to $1.28 billion.
Revenue from broadcast television dropped 29.4 percent year-on-year to $2.47 billion. Excluding last year's Olympics and Super Bowl from the prior-year comparison, however, revenue rose.
Comcast, which bought the British pay-TV group Sky last year, said revenue reported from Sky was $4.8 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned 76 cents per share, beating estimates of 68 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Comcast's overall revenue rose 18 percent to $26.86 billion, but fell short of Wall Street expectations of $27.20 billion.

134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Wall Street Nears a Big Win in the Latest Revamp of Volcker Rule,"(Bloomberg) -- In a win for Wall Street banks, the latest effort to overhaul the post-crisis Volcker Rule is moving toward a narrower and clearer definition of what types of trades are prohibited, said people familiar with the matter.
Regulators appointed by President Donald Trump took a first stab last year at toning down Volcker’s trading limits, which were meant to prevent bankers from threatening the financial system. However, bankers blasted the revamp, arguing it might make it even harder for firms to buy and sell securities. In response to that criticism, the watchdogs are now focused on erasing the 2018 proposal’s centerpiece -- known among regulators as the “accounting prong” that would have determined which trades are banned.
Read More: Why Push to Redo Volcker Rule Has Traders Salivating
A less onerous method embedded in the original Volcker has become the favored replacement for the accounting test, said three people who asked not to be named because an expected rewrite hasn’t been completed. Senior officials at the five federal agencies revising Volcker met April 16 to discuss the new direction, the people said. The change would be an unmistakable victory for megabanks, which have been lobbying to weaken Volcker ever since its inclusion in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.
Spokesmen for the federal agencies involved declined to comment.
The original rule was meant to prevent lenders with federally backed deposit insurance from suffering huge trading losses, as they did before the 2008 financial crisis. Named for its advocate, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the rule prohibits proprietary trading -- the practice of banks betting on markets with their own capital. Transactions are perfectly fine if they’re executed on behalf of clients.
But detractors say confusion over which short-term trades pass muster has made banks too cautious, prompting a retrenchment from certain assets that -- according to much-debated research -- could dry up liquidity when markets are under stress.
Getting Wall Street relief from Volcker has been a top priority for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials. While it’s unclear how soon that will happen, re-writing last year’s proposal could delay the process by months.
In their 2018 proposal, known as Volcker 2.0, the Fed and other agencies sought to give more certainty over which trades are permitted by introducing the accounting prong. It would have forced banks to apply accounting standards to certain transactions, and if the firms experienced sharp enough gains or losses, the trades would be presumed to be violating Volcker.
Banks ripped the idea -- with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). leading the charge. The firm, in an October 2018 letter to the Fed, called the proposal “highly problematic” because it could rope in a lot of transactions not even outlawed by the existing version of Volcker.

In recent discussions, regulators have weighed dumping the accounting measure and relying more heavily on something known as the market-risk capital prong, the people said. That method, which is already in Volcker, prohibits trades involving financial instruments that are generally held for sale in the short term. The change would probably be appealing to banks because it’s based on rules they already have to follow.
The bottom line: Compliance under the market-risk capital test would be less burdensome because lenders would no longer have to make subjective calls about their intentions with each trade. Whether Wall Street trading books would swell is harder to predict.
In their current re-write, officials are also seeking to ease constraints on banks’ investments in private equity and hedge funds, the people said, an area largely ignored in the 2018 proposal. The Fed, which is leading the effort, might relax restrictions on foreign lenders’ investment funds, and it could give U.S. banks more leeway to provide credit to certain funds, according to the people.
The five agencies responsible for the rule -- the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- are also working to streamline the data that’s supposed to be reported to regulators under Volcker, the people said.
A new Volcker proposal to replace last year’s version -- an effort one agency head joked could be called Volcker 2.1 -- would push back a final overhaul of the trading rule. Still, several officials including Treasury Department counselor Craig Phillips, who has led that agency’s work on regulatory policies, have openly suggested a re-proposal may be necessary.
Even when issuing Volcker 2.0 in 2018, Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said regulators might not be done with the job, calling it “an important milestone in comprehensive Volcker rule reform, but not the completion of our work.”"

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF) is ""not in a hurry"" to issue bonds but is assessing several funding options, an executive said on Thursday.
The PIF has been given the task of helping to deliver the so-called Vision 2030 reform plan, an ambitious economic program announced by the government in 2016 designed to free the kingdom from dependence on oil exports.
Last year the fund raised an $11 billion international syndicated loan, its first commercial borrowing, and sources told Reuters this month it has been in talks with banks to raise a short-term bridge loan for as much as $8 billion to use for new investments.
""We have a program we defined back in 2017 in terms of long-term strategic funding plans for PIF. Within that plan we look at all instruments, we assess pros and cons and we action and execute if they make sense to us,"" Alireza Zaimi, executive director, head of corporate finance division at PIF told a financial conference in Riyadh on Thursday.
The fund, which has more than $250 billion in assets and is the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's plan to diversify economy away from oil, will receive $69.1 billion from the sale of its 70 percent stake in Saudi petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) to Aramco.
It is also due to receive the proceeds of a planned initial public offering of the Saudi state-owned oil giant.
""There are plenty of cash flows that are coming through these two liquidity events, therefore we assess all instruments, but are we in a hurry to issue a bond in the market? No we're not in a hurry,"" Zaimi said.
Proceeds from the SABIC deal, which Aramco has said is expected to close in 2020, could take a few months to come through to the PIF, while a document seen by Reuters said the oil giant will pay for the deal in tranches.
The bridge loan that PIF has been discussing, and that could go up to $8 billion, could be for a period of less than one year and will be repaid from the proceeds PIF gets from the SABIC sale, sources said this month.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - In April 2017, a group of Mexican executives filed into the Texas governor's mansion in Austin for a meeting they hoped would help save a trillion-dollar trade deal.
They had a simple pitch for their audience - Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a handful of business leaders and some party donors: it would be in Texas' best interest to preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Abbott was just one of the prominent names on a list of dozens of American politicians and business executives that Mexico would carefully compile to help save NAFTA from the relentless attacks of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Supplying them with up-to-date information on trade and investment flows, the Mexicans believed the Americans could persuade policymakers that scrapping NAFTA would hurt U.S. workers and companies. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2I9Q1Gb)
Rather than ""be good to Mexico,"" said Juan Gallardo, a prominent Mexican businessman who helped craft the strategy, the message was ""don't shoot yourself in the foot.""
The inside story of Mexico's efforts to stop Trump from killing NAFTA – and to preserve its essence in a reworked accord – comes from interviews with more than 20 Mexican and U.S. officials, lawmakers and executives involved in the process.
After 18 months of talks and concessions by both sides, a deal was struck. Canada later signed on in what became known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which awaits ratification by lawmakers in the three countries.
But final approval has become more uncertain since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives from Republicans, a potential setback to Mexico's best laid plans.
GIVING GROUND
Mexican business and political leaders, including the heads of the foreign and economy ministries, started scrambling to save the 25-year-old trade deal right after Trump's election in November 2016.
Early on, they decided to avoid public confrontation with Trump, who had made blaming NAFTA for job losses, particularly in manufacturing, a centerpiece of his campaign.
""Tit-for-tat wasn't going to work,"" said Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby. ""We agreed not to even get into the ring.""
Trump showed no sign of backing off after taking office in January 2017, telling aides he wanted to withdraw simultaneously from NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), according to three Mexican business and government leaders.
When Trump pulled out of TPP that month, Mexican officials feared NAFTA would be next. In Mexico City, then-foreign minister Luis Videgaray and his counterpart in the economy ministry, Ildefonso Guajardo, flew to Washington to sketch out possible concessions for an overhauled trade pact. 
Meeting with Trump's economic advisors and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, they floated stricter content rules for auto manufacturing, tougher Mexican labor laws and changes to dispute resolution mechanisms, Mexican participants said.
Those early concessions would eventually evolve into new rules set out in the USMCA deal.
""I'm absolutely convinced that if that didn't happen ... NAFTA would have died in January 2017,"" Videgaray told Reuters shortly before leaving office.
While Videgaray dangled concessions, Mexico's private sector rolled out a lobbying operation underpinned by reams of data supplied by IQOM, a Mexican trade consultancy.
Headquartered in an old stone townhouse in Mexico City, IQOM collected data and intelligence to pinpoint U.S. businesses with the most to lose from a NAFTA repeal. Two top Mexican negotiators of the original NAFTA, Herminio Blanco and Jaime Zabludovsky, spearheaded the effort.
It was ""a permanent, online, computer-based information-gathering drive,"" said IQOM partner Zabludovsky. ""And a lot of data crunching.""
Meanwhile, the CCE hired Washington lobbying firm Akin Gump in the summer of 2017 to help identify about 250 potential U.S. allies, Gallardo said.
Akin Gump and the CCE communicated daily and met regularly. The idea was to ""engage with USMCA stakeholders on both sides of the aisle and in the Trump administration,"" an Akin Gump spokesperson said, and build ""CCE's brand and reputation as a trusted partner.""
Throughout the process, Mexican negotiators were in close contact with their Canadian counterparts - even as Mexico also left the door open to a bilateral deal with the United States.
EYE-OPENER
During negotiations, Mexico's private sector had some 200 representatives in Washington updating its negotiators on how best to pitch the case to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to sources involved in the process.
Each member of Mexico's team also had politicians or executives to target. Kalach of the CCE said he spoke to 36 U.S. state governors about the value of cross-border trade.
Mexican participants often expressed surprise about how little U.S. politicians knew about the extent of bilateral economic ties. Even in Texas, the state doing the most trade with Mexico, some officials appeared not to have grasped fully what a NAFTA termination could cost, Gallardo said.
At the April 2017 meeting in the governor's mansion, the Mexican delegation gave a detailed breakdown of trade between Mexico and Texas to Abbott and the others, who included Gerardo Schwebel, executive vice president of the International Bank of Commerce, and oil tycoon Paul Foster, sources said.
Economic ties were explained ""by players, by amounts,"" Gallardo said. ""That was an eye-opener... no one had ever put that together into one paper.""
Abbott eventually sent a letter to Lighthizer defending NAFTA - emphasizing that Texas exported more than $90 billion of goods to Mexico annually and that nearly a million jobs depended on free trade with the NAFTA partners.
In a second letter to Lighthizer, Abbott asked the Trump administration to ""reconsider"" its demand for a sunset clause that could have killed the new agreement in five years, a major Mexican concern. In the end, the clause was left out.
John Wittman, a spokesman for Abbott, confirmed the Austin meeting, adding that the governor had been engaged with various stakeholders and White House officials throughout NAFTA talks.
Lighthizer's office did not respond to a request for comment.
HELP FROM WALL STREET
High among the list of prospective allies drawn up by Mexico were several top Wall Street executives, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman and KKR's Henry Kravis.
Dimon chairs the Business Roundtable, which, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was viewed by the Mexicans as a powerful voice in support of NAFTA. The banking executive proved particularly effective, Mexican and U.S. sources said.
Among others, a source familiar with the situation said, Dimon met with Kushner, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic adviser until April 2018.
Calling Mexico a peaceful neighbor, Dimon publicly argued a trade agreement would help ""ensure that the young democracy in Mexico is not hijacked by populist and anti-American leaders.""
Mnuchin held multiple meetings with counterparts, and offered his input to Lighthizer as he negotiated USMCA, a U.S. Treasury official said. Mnuchin sees Canada and Mexico as important trading partners, and believes free and fair trade with them benefits the United States, the official added.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the meetings. Representatives for Cohn, Schwarzman and Kravis declined to comment or did not reply to requests for one.
Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Chief Executive Officer Pat Ottensmeyer, whose company runs trains through Mexico, was a staunch advocate for NAFTA in the United States, and also consulted with top-level Mexican officials.
Between Trump's inauguration and the end of 2018, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:SO) said it had organized or participated in 65 meetings with lawmakers or regulators, as well as 76 speeches or conferences in defense of NAFTA.
Ottensmeyer recalled speaking to several cabinet members, including Lighthizer and current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, when he was still head of the CIA.
The approach was to ""literally talk to anybody and everybody who we thought was willing to listen and could be influential in the process,"" Ottensmeyer told Reuters.
A representative for Pompeo declined to comment.
Within months, Mexico's lobbying efforts began paying dividends: American politicians and business executives were making a case for NAFTA directly to the White House, pushing back on Trump's ongoing threats to rip up NAFTA.

""From what I understand,"" Gallardo said, ""Trump never, ever in his wildest dreams imagined the kind of uproar this was going to create. And that's what stopped him.""

Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is under intense scrutiny after the United States told allies not to use its technology because of fears it could be a vehicle for Chinese spying. Huawei has categorically denied this.
Sources told Reuters on Wednesday Britain's National Security Council (NSC) had decided to bar Huawei from all core parts of the country's 5G network and restrict its access to non-core parts.
The leak of information from a meeting of the NSC, first reported in national newspapers, has sparked anger in parliament because the committee's discussion are supposed to be secret.
""We cannot exclude the possibility of a criminal investigation here,"" Wright said, speaking in response to an urgent question on Huawei in parliament. 
""I do not think that the motivation for this leak matters in the slightest. This was unacceptable and it is corrosive to the ability to deliver good government.""
Wright said that such leaks endangered the ability of the committee, made up of senior ministers and which hears regularly from intelligence agency bosses, to get unequivocal and frank security advice from experts.
""Decisions will get less and less properly-based if we can't trust people to keep private what should be kept private,"" he said. 
A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May, who chairs the NSC, declined to comment upon leaks or questions on leak enquiries, but said: ""The prime minister is clear that the protection of information on matters of national security is of the highest importance.""

Wright said that he would report to parliament the conclusions of a government review of the 5G supply chain once they had been taken.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 07:16AM ET</span>",Bristol-Myers profit slightly tops Wall Street view on blood thinner sales,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, which is set to buy biotechnology company  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) for $74 billion, posted slightly better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Thursday on strong sales of its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis.
Net earnings in the quarter rose to $1.71 billion, or $1.04 a share, from $1.49 billion, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned $1.10 a share. That beat the average analyst estimate by a penny, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Bristol-Myers said it still expects full-year adjusted earnings of $4.10 to $4.20 per share.
Revenue in the quarter was $5.92 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $5.75 billion.
That difference is largely due to Eliquis, which Bristol shares with  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) Sales of the drug used to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes jumped 28 percent from last year to $1.93 billion. Analysts had expected $1.82 billion from the drug in the quarter.
Sales of cancer immunotherapy Opdivo were in line with Wall Street expectations at $1.8 billion, up 19 percent from a year ago but basically flat compared with the previous quarter.
Bristol-Myers pioneered cancer immunotherapy with its first such drug Yervoy and later Opdivo. But Merck & Co's rival treatment Keytruda has taken a dominant position in lung cancer - the most lucrative oncology market - taking a toll on Bristol-Myers shares.
Some analysts and investors have suggested that one reason Bristol launched its bid for Celgene was over concerns about Opdivo's growth after losing ground to Merck.
Bristol said it still expects the deal to close in the third quarter, after its shareholders voted to approve the deal earlier this month despite a campaign by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP to scuttle it.
The company announced in early January that it planned to buy Celgene in a cash and stock transaction to bring together companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in what would be the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever.
The New York-based drugmaker has said the combined company will have six drugs with expected near-term launches - five from the Celgene pipeline - representing over $15 billion in annual revenue potential, as well as strong early-stage experimental assets.

Shares of Bristol-Myers closed at $44.62 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. They are off by about a third since October, when shares dropped due to setbacks for Opdivo in lung cancer.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>","Nokia plunges to surprise quarterly loss, shares hit six-month low","By Tarmo Virki and Anne Kauranen
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) plunged to a surprise quarterly loss after it failed to supply 5G telecoms equipment in time, and said the security dispute surrounding rival Huawei was creating pressure to invest as customers reassess their suppliers.
Shares fell 9 percent to 4.68 euros on the news on Thursday, their lowest level in six months. Nokia said it would be under significant pressure to deliver in the second half after a slow start to the year in supplying next-generation mobile gear.
Nokia counts Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and China's Huawei as its main rivals, and some analysts say the Finnish company may benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - charges Huawei denies. 
Ericsson last week posted January-March quarter profit that beat forecasts, spurring the Swedish firm to lift its outlook for the global telecom networks market.
But Nokia said on Thursday: ""Some customers are reassessing their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure to invest in order to secure long-term benefits.""
Nokia said a failure to book about 200 million euros ($222 million) of net sales related to 5G in North America weighed on its first-quarter results. It expects to recognize the amount during the full year.
The company's core networks business generated a loss of 254 million euros during the quarter, compared with a gain of 46 million in the year-ago quarter, as its investments into 5G are yet to generate profits.
DIFFERENT SPEED
Investors and analysts said different speeds of rollout of 5G product offering, and a different set of customers could explain why Nokia has had a rockier start to 2019 than Ericsson. 
""Huawei's unclear situation has turned negative for Nokia in the short term, even though it should be more of an opportunity in the longer term,"" said analyst Mikael Rautanen of equity research firm Inderes, referring to operators postponing their investment decisions.
""It looks like Nokia has not upgraded its product offering fully to 5G yet. They explain it with external reasons like standards, but there have to be also internal factors,"" he said.
Nokia, which signaled in January that it would have a particularly weak first quarter, made an operating loss (non-IFRS) of 59 million euros, compared with a profit of 239 million euros in the year-ago quarter.

(Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) stood out for the wrong reasons on Thursday as European shares edged lower following a mixed bag of earnings from the region and concerns for the euro zone economy resurfaced after a weak German sentiment survey a day earlier.
The Finnish telecom network equipment maker slid nearly 10 percent, its sharpest decline in 18 months, after it reported a surprise quarterly loss, citing hard competition in its core networks business.

Britain's Barclays slipped after reporting a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit, as its under-pressure investment bank struggled with tough markets.

MILAN (Reuters) - French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) is close to agreeing to pay between 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion euros ($1.5-1.6 billion) to settle a dispute with Italian authorities over unpaid taxes by its fashion brand Gucci, three sources told Reuters on Thursday.
An agreement between the group and the Italian tax authority is expected to be signed in the first few days of May, said one of the sources, who all have direct knowledge of the matter.
This would be the biggest tax settlement ever agreed by a company with the Italian tax authorities.
Kering said in an emailed statement it had held regular discussions with the Italian tax service, adding the meetings took place in ""an open and collaborative climate"".
""At this stage, no agreement has been reached yet on any specific figure,"" it added. 
The tax authority could not immediately be reached for comment.
Earlier this year, Kering said it faced a claim for 1.4 billion euros in unpaid Italian taxes, adding it contested the preliminary findings.
The group has consistently denied avoiding tax, saying its activities were fully compliant with all tax obligations.
The company's Swiss-based Luxury Goods International (LGI) subsidiary has been under investigation for allegedly avoiding tax on earnings generated elsewhere.
Most of the allegations centre on Gucci, whose offices in Milan and Florence were raided by Italian police in late 2017.
In November, Milan prosecutors wrapped up their probe into alleged tax evasion of more than 1 billion euros by Gucci for revenues booked in the years between 2010 and 2016. 
The prosecutors say that revenues booked through LGI should be taxed in Italy and not in Switzerland. 
By agreeing to a settlement, Kering would be spared from having to pay interest and sanctions for late tax payments, which one source said would have added around 500 million euros to the final bill.
Gucci's Chief Executive Marco Bizzarri and former CEO Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation in the case.
That investigation is expected to conclude with a separate settlement once the agreement on the tax dispute has been signed, one of the sources added. Lawyers for Bizzarri and Di Marco declined to comment.

155,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 04:12AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Deutsche Bank - Commerzbank Merger Hits the Rocks ,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- A flurry of news from the banking sector stands out amid a generally weak start to Thursday in Europe’s stock markets.
Germany’s two biggest private-sector banks,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), have called off their merger talks, under pressure from shareholders, regulators and unions.
The mooted merger was never the preferred option of either bank, as both are more preoccupied with trying to turn round chronically unprofitable operations. The talks only came about largely because of political pressure from Germany’s finance ministry to ensure the survival of a national champion.
Such logic convinced neither regulators, who feared the creation of a new ‘too-big-to-fail’ bank that would hold German policy-makers hostage, nor the labor unions of both institutions, who feared up to 30,000 job cuts.
Deutsche was up 3.2% on relief at having escaped the nightmare of such a politically charged merger, although the shares’ valuation at only 0.24 times their book value shows that it still has huge challenges ahead. Commerzbank’s stock is down 2.0%, reflecting the loss of a potential buyer.
Even so, it’s not impossible that a bidding war of sorts could still emerge for the bank: Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI) SpA and Dutch-based ING (AS:INGA) have both indicated interest, according to recent reports, and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) had also looked at Commerzbank a couple of years back. None of those shares is reacting with any enthusiasm to the notion that they may now be more likely to get their hands on it.
Elsewhere,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) was down 2% despite a generally decent set of results notable for its investment bank division again faring better than many U.S. rivals in the turmoil of the first quarter. That should bolster the position of CEO Jes Staley, who will face a motion at next week’s shareholder meeting to admit activist investor Edward Bramson on to the board. Bramson is pushing for the investment bank to be scaled back drastically.
Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland's (LON:RBS) shareholder meeting was preceded today by news that CEO Ross McEwan is to step down. He’ll still serve for the next year. Under McEwan, RBS has returned to profitability and settled most of the governance-related scandals that plagued it for the last decade.
None of this is stopping a wave of profit-taking in markets across the continent, however, The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.10 points, or 0.3% at 389.78, while the FTSE 100 was down 0.5% and the German DAX down 0.3%, depressed by more gloomy statements from central banks in Canada and Japan, and by weak economic data out of South Korea."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Chairman Carlos Ghosn was set to walk out of a Japanese detention center for a second time since his arrest last year on financial misconduct charges, after posting the $4.5 million bail set by a Tokyo court on Thursday.
Bail will enable the former titan of the global auto industry to better prepare for his criminal trial expected later this year, when he will fight his latest charge of aggravated breach of trust along with three other accusations of financial misdoing during his time at the helm of Japan's No. 2 automaker.
Ghosn has denied all four charges against him, which include understating his income and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books. 
The Tokyo District Court said in a statement that it had approved a bail request from Ghosn's defense team and set bail at 500 million yen ($4.5 million), roughly half his previous bail of 1 billion yen.
The once-feted executive will be free to leave the detention center where he has been in custody since his April 4 re-arrest, but his movements and communications will be strictly monitored and restricted to prevent fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the court said. 
Ghosn's lawyers filed the bail request on Monday after the former executive was indicted for allegedly enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan from July 2017 through July 2018.
The court's decision marks the second time Ghosn has made bail and is the latest turn in a scandal which has rocked the global auto industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
He was initially released last month, but then re-arrested earlier this month on the new charges, returning to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent 108 days following his first arrest in November.
Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of ""backstabbing"", describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and Renault, its top shareholder.
When he was last released, the former executive traded in his usual tailored suit and chauffeured sedan for a disguise of workman's uniform, glasses and a mask to slip past reporters before being whisked away in a modest compact van.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A SoftBank Corp subsidiary said on Wednesday it had invested $125 million in an Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc company that is working to fly cellphone antennas high in the atmosphere to provide internet in areas that are difficult to reach.
SoftBank's HAPSMobile, which has also been trying to fly networking equipment at high altitudes to provide high-speed internet to areas that are out of range of land towers, said it had invested in Loon, a unit of the Google owner.
Loon, spun out from Alphabet's business incubator in July, carries the gear with a long balloon, while HAPSMobile uses a drone. Both systems are solar powered, limiting the areas they can serve to equatorial regions of the globe.
Mobile network operators, governments and other potential clients have yet to demonstrate much enthusiasm for buying such technologies, despite the need to plug gaps in internet coverage in rural areas or at times of natural disasters.
The two firms are competing with billionaire entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, which are all backing separate ventures that aim to offer internet links using satellites in near-Earth orbit.
Loon and HAPSMobile said at a Tokyo news conference on Wednesday that they needed to collaborate to win over customers and were discussing sharing technology, standardizing gear and cooperating in regulatory talks.
The firms said in a joint statement they had entered a ""long-term"" partnership.
""I'm confident we can accelerate the path toward the realization of utilizing the stratosphere for global networks by pooling our technologies, insights and experience,"" Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank chief technology officer and HAPSMobile chief executive, said in the statement. 
Miyakawa said HAPSMobile had taken a minority stake in Loon at its request and a right to observe board meetings. HAPSMobile did not expect to fund additional companies operating in the same field but was open to receiving investment, he said.
HAPSMobile, which uses technology developed by dronemaker AeroVironment Inc that has a 10 percent stake in the Softbank unit, planned to test its drone at Lanai Airport in Hawaii and was also discussing conducting tests in Australia, Miyakawa told Reuters.
Securing certfication from aviation agencies could take up to three years, he said.
Loon, which has tested balloons for nearly a decade and expects to hold its first commercial trial in Kenya by mid-year, has not ruled out raising additional funding, Chief Executive Alastair Westgarth said.

Loon has an option to invest $125 million in HAPSMobile for a minority stake at a later date.

159,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",What Props Up First-Quarter U.S. Growth Will Weigh on It Later,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy’s first quarter is looking a lot rosier than a few weeks ago, but the factors supporting that growth may be more ephemeral rather than a sign of sustained momentum.
That’s because rising inventories and a smaller-than-expected trade gap were among the main forces pushing up gross domestic product estimates for the first three months of 2019.
Thanks partly to those two volatile components, a Commerce Department report Friday is expected to show GDP expanded at a 2.2 percent annualized pace in the period -- matching the fourth quarter and about in line with the 10-year average -- rather than the 1.5 percent seen in early March, according to Bloomberg’s surveys of economists.
“It’s a good news, bad news story,” said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. “If inventories are a big driver of growth in one quarter, then that sets you up for slower growth in subsequent quarters.”
Growth also likely got a lift from consumer spending -- the largest part of the economy -- after retail sales surged last month by the most since 2017. That eased some concern but expectations remain that consumers will pull back this year despite sustained wage gains and a tight labor market.
The more positive outlook is a shift in expectations from as recently as a week ago, when analysts saw several factors denting GDP, including the government shutdown that spanned most of January, extreme weather, and a trade war with China.
The more upbeat news has coincided with U.S. stocks rising to a record this week and the Treasury yield curve moving away from an inversion that had signaled greater recession risk. While a brighter outlook would reduce arguments for a rate cut, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will keep borrowing costs unchanged this year amid subdued inflation -- plus, an unwinding of the inventories buildup is likely to drag down growth later in 2019.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“While first-quarter GDP is likely to show a significant deceleration from last year’s pace, a second-quarter rebound will be stifled by a significant inventory reduction, thereby extending an impression of lukewarm economic growth through midyear. Bloomberg Economics projects first-quarter GDP growth below 2 percent, with inventory accumulation essentially mirroring the fourth quarter.” --Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, economists
Fed officials at their policy meeting next week are expected to hold interest rates steady while making adjustments to their characterization of the economy to reflect the firmer data. The central bank won’t release quarterly projections until the next gathering in June.
Other headwinds remain, including residential and corporate spending that’s weakened after an initial tax cut-fueled boost in 2018. That helps explain why analysts are still skeptical that the U.S. expansion -- though on the verge of becoming the nation’s longest on record in July -- will still come short of President Donald Trump’s goal of a sustained 3 percent pace.
On the downside, factory production fell in the first quarter and business-equipment orders showed signs of cooling amid a dimming global growth outlook and trade-war uncertainty.
In addition, the Fed’s preferred price gauge, excluding food and energy, probably rose at a slower pace in the first quarter than the prior period, keeping inflation below its 2 percent objective.
“Though growth now looks a fair bit better than it did a month or two ago, it doesn’t necessarily mean the Fed is going to pivot back because they still want to see inflation,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “The Fed will welcome the better growth, but I don’t think it’s going to really change much for them in the near future.”
A statistical quirk actually may argue in favor of growth picking up later in the year. The phenomenon known as residual seasonality has contributed to persistently lower GDP readings in the first quarter, something government statisticians are trying to remedy. The first quarter was the worst reading -- or tied for it -- in seven of the past 10 years.
Meanwhile, the housing market is showing signs of stabilization as lower borrowing costs attract buyers. New home sales climbed at the fastest pace since 2017 in March, while applications for home loans recently rose to the highest weekly level in almost nine years.
“Recent data put some of people’s more-extreme fears about recession to rest,” said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. “Despite all these disruptions -- the government shutdown, polar vortex, bomb cyclone in the Midwest -- things weren’t that bad.”

160,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 03:17AM ET</span>","Facebook beats profit estimates, sets aside $3 billion for privacy penalty","By Katie Paul and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday blew past Wall Street profit estimates in the first quarter and set aside $3 billion to cover a settlement with U.S. regulators, calming investors who had worried about the outcome of a months-long federal probe.
Shares of the world's biggest online social network jumped more than 10 percent to $200.50 in after-hours trade. They have now regained much of the ground lost last year amid slowing growth and costs associated with the company's privacy scandals. 
The settlement accrual, which Facebook set at $3 billion but said could rise as high as $5 billion, cut the company's net income in the first quarter to $2.43 billion, or 85 cents per share.
Excluding the charge, Facebook would have earned $1.89 a share, up from $1.69 in the year-ago quarter and easily beating analysts' average estimate of $1.63 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total first-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $15.1 billion from $12.0 billion last year, again beating analysts' average estimate of $15.0 billion.
""This is a strong report suggesting that advertisers still see value in Facebook's platform, as they did before the controversies and scandals erupted,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
Monthly and daily users of the main Facebook app were both up 8 percent compared to last year, to 2.4 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively, in line with forecasts.
Total expenses in the first quarter were $11.8 billion, including the settlement accrual, up 80 percent compared with a year ago as the company hired content moderators and invested in new security controls to make its social networks safer.
Executives said in a conference call with investors that they expected expenses to grow 47 to 55 percent this year, updating their earlier forecast of an increase of 40 to 50 percent.
The first-quarter operating margin fell to 22 percent from 46 percent a year ago, but would have been a comfortable 42 percent without the one-time expense.
BIGGEST PENALTY
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.
A settlement of between $3 billion and $5 billion would be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the agency, said David Vladeck, a former FTC official who is now a professor at Georgetown Law School.
""Everyone expected there would be a substantial civil penalty in this case,"" said Vladeck. ""There's no question that Facebook is going to have to settle this matter. Investors want this behind them.""
Even once the FTC probe is resolved, other challenges remain. The number of Facebook users barely budged in the United States, Canada and Europe, indicating saturation in the company's most lucrative markets.
Its largest and fastest-growing user base is now in Asia, where monthly active users jumped 12.4 percent from last year. The region represents nearly half of all Facebook users, but brought in less than a fifth of the company's revenue.
That shift in geography, along with slow advertiser adoption of new services like Stories, resulted in a 4 percent decline in the average price per ad in the first quarter.
Facebook plans to shift focus toward private communications, integrating its messaging services across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, but has not yet articulated how it will adapt its advertising-driven business model.
The company launched a sales system last month that enables users to purchase products directly on Instagram and is testing a WhatsApp payments system in India that it plans to roll out to other countries, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said.
""In countries where we already are the leading platform there will be more ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in additional ways that people want to interact privately,"" he said. But the services would not be a ""major driver"" of Facebook's business for at least a couple of years, he said.
Facebook also faces the prospect of action by lawmakers, with some calling for federal privacy regulation and anti-trust action to break up big tech companies.
Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust issues, said on Twitter that Facebook was ""a repeat offender"" and called for an FTC response ""strong enough to prevent future violations.""

""A fine in the low billions of dollars would amount to a slap on the wrist for Facebook. Tonight, we learned that's how Wall Street sees it too - as a slap on the wrist. If the FTC won't act, Congress has to,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drug and farming supplies company Bayer (DE:BAYGN) posted a 45 percent gain in quarterly core earnings thanks to the acquisition of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), while the legal burden it took on with the deal mounted.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose to 4.19 billion euros ($4.67 billion), it said on Thursday, edging past the 4.12 billion euro average analyst forecast in a Reuters poll.
Bayer said 13,400 plaintiffs were seeking damages, alleging that use of the company's glyphosate-based weedkillers caused their cancer, up from 11,200 in January.
Bayer has seen about 30 billion euros ($34 billion) wiped off its market value since August, when a California jury in that lawsuit found that Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks. 
It will face shareholders' anger at its annual general meeting on Friday.
""We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all of these
lawsuits,"" the company said.
On Wednesday, Bayer launched an appeal with a California court to throw out the first glyphosate-related judgment for $78 million in damages.
When including Monsanto's pro-forma 2018 results in the comparison, revenues at Bayer's Crop Science division from pesticides and seeds were broadly flat at 6.35 billion euros, excluding currency effects.
That was above an analyst consensus of 6.13 billion, as the launch of new insecticide products helped offset a decline on soybean seed sales. The shares were indicated 3.3 percent higher in early Frankfurt floor trading at 0742 GMT.
The company is still aiming for an increase in 2019 EBITDA before special items to about 12.2 billion euros, excluding the effect of currency swings and the planned sale of assets such as the animal health unit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped to three-week lows on Thursday as a surprise deterioration in German and South Korean economic data rekindled fears of slowing global growth, while oil prices pulled back slightly after a sharp run-up earlier in the week.
European stocks are expected to fare slightly better, with futures up 0.15-0.25 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.5 percent, while Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.5 percent.
The Japanese yen traded slightly higher than then previous session's four-month lows and showed a muted response to a Bank of Japan policy pledge to keep interest rates very low at least until early 2020, even as it retained main policy targets.
The BOJ also said it would consider introducing a facility to lend the exchange traded funds that it buys and holds as part of its monetary operations. 
The Nikkei didn't react to the move and traders couldn't agree if the measure was aimed at improving stock market liquidity or just cash conditions.
""This is one very technical move, I would assume, aimed at lack of liquidity in the stock market. I wouldn't consider it as a monetary policy,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Japan's central bank also lowered growth and price projections for 2020.
Earlier in the day, data showing the South Korean economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter of the year also added to worries about the dual-speed nature of the global economy. 
Chotaro Morita, chief rates strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities, noted hopes that the Chinese economy is bottoming out have contributed to recent rallies in global equities.
""Corporate earnings that have been released so far suggests the worst period for the Chinese economy was over. While that is supportive of share prices, that alone is not enough to keep the rally going for more than a month,"" he said.

The euro sat little changed at $1.1157, a day after suffering its biggest one-day loss against the dollar since early March.
The deteriorating reading on German business morale, in a survey by the IFO economic institute, bucked expectations for a small improvement.
The British pound held at a two-month low, weighed down by a broad-based rally in the dollar and fading hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit talks between the British government and the opposition. The currency pair last stood at $1.291, slightly higher on the day. 
The Canadian dollar also flirted with four-month lows, trading at C$1.3488 per U.S. dollar, after the Bank of Canada removed wording around the need for future hikes and lowered its growth forecast.
U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities on Wednesday as investors piled into the safe-haven asset after a slew of weak international economic data.

SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc said on Thursday it would stop producing smartphones in South Korea and move manufacturing to Vietnam, joining global rivals in reorganizing production as they battle a slump in global demand.
The restructuring of its money-losing business comes as LG, once one of the world's top three mobile phone makers, has seen its global market share spiraling to less than 3 percent in the decade that smartphones came to dominate the mobile market.
""I find its decision positive,"" said analyst John Park at Daishin Securities.
""Their existence may be barely noticeable in the global smartphone market, but they have solid presence in the U.S. market. It's too early for them to close the whole business when fifth generation (5G) networks are starting,"" Park said.
LG is ranked third in the U.S. smartphone market, with a 17 percent share as of the third quarter of 2018, showed data from market researcher Counterpoint, after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd.
LG, whose smartphone business has been losing money for several years, said in a statement that shifting production will boost annual capacity of its smartphone plant in Vietnam by 83 percent to 11 million handsets from the second half of 2019.
It said Vietnam provides an ""abundant labor force"", and that 750 workers at its South Korean handset factory would be relocated to its home appliance plant.
LG also makes smartphones in China, Brazil and India.
The shift comes after Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker, said late last year it would cease operations at one of its mobile phone plants in China.
Japan's Sony Corp (T:6758) is also closing its Beijing smartphone plant as it works to make its money-losing handset business profitable.

Panasonic, currently the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla, produces cells for the EV maker at their joint plant in the U.S. state of Nevada - the so-called Gigafactory - as well as at two plants in Japan.
The Japanese plants handle cylindrical lithium-ion ""18650"" cells, used to power Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles, whereas the Nevada plant produces the newer, higher-energy density ""2170"" cells for the mass-market Model 3 sedan.
The Japanese production lines would only need minor changes to switch to 2170 cells from the 18650, said the person, who declined to be identified as the matter was private.
Japan's Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Wednesday that the upgrade could take place in this financial year ending March 2020.
Panasonic in a statement said nothing has been decided.
The development comes after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Panasonic had been ""a constraint on Model 3 output since July"". Panasonic's Nevada output is 24 gigawatt-hours (GWh), Musk tweeted this month, as opposed to the planned 35 GWh capacity.

Panasonic said it had completed installation of its equipment for a Nevada capacity of 35 GWh by the end of March 2019, but that not all the installed equipment is in full operation.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component were down 0.5% and 0.6% respectively by 10:45PM ET (02:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded near flat.
Chinese stocks were under pressure this week as traders questioned the likelihood of further stimulus in China after a politburo statement issued on Monday said regulators are getting increasingly concerned of asset bubbles.
Trade headlines are in focus as China and the U.S. prepare for another round of trade talks next week.
The discussions “will cover trade issues including intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases and enforcement,” according to a White House statement.
South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.1% after data showed the country’s GDP shrank the most in a decade in the first quarter of 2019.

CANTANHEDE, Portugal (Reuters) - Famous for its roasted suckling pig and wines, the Portuguese city of Cantanhede now hosts the country's first medical cannabis production farm - a budding European hub of efforts to meet growing demand for the flowering herb.
Portugal's California-like weather caught the eye of Canada-based Tilray as its CEO Brendan Kennedy roved around Europe from 2015 to 2017 in search of the perfect spot for a new production site. 
Kennedy said Portugal had the ideal climate for cannabis cultivation and the country's young, educated workforce and its major agricultural sector were further attractions. 
Covering 2.4 hectares (5.9 acres) in a biotechnology park just outside Cantanhede, Tilray's site was given the green light by Portugal's regulator Infarmed in 2017. The company then rushed to import its first baby plants and recently reported its first two successful cannabis harvests.Kennedy opened the site to visitors for the first time at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday.
""Some of our competitors are located in Denmark and northern Germany, where there isn't that much sun - so we think we can produce a more environmentally-friendly product here,"" he told Reuters. 
Portugal also offers tariff-free entry to the rest of the European Union, a market Tilray wants to explore further at a time when an increasing number of governments are legalising medical marijuana. 
FROM PROHIBITION TO LEGALISATION
""The paradigm is shifting from prohibition to legalisation,"" Kennedy said, with demand for the product growing. ""I'm fairly optimistic that over the next two years we will see every country in Europe legalising it."" 
Last year Portugal's parliament approved a bill to legalise marijuana-based medicines, following in the footsteps of EU countries such as Italy and Germany as well as Canada and parts of the United States. Britain made a similar move in July 2018.
Tilray's 20-million-euro ($22.29 million) facility includes indoor, outdoor and greenhouse cultivation sites, as well as research labs, processing, packaging and distribution sites for medical cannabis and cannabinoid-derived products. 
Tilray supplies medical cannabis products with CBD and THC to patients in a number of countries, through subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, Germany and Latin American, and through agreements with pharmaceutical distributors. 
Earlier this year, the European Parliament called for an EU-wide policy on medical cannabis and properly funded scientific research.
""We are at point where almost every doctor around the world recognises the medical benefits of cannabis,"" Kennedy said.
The World Health Organization has stated that several studies have demonstrated cannabinoids provide therapeutic effects for nausea and vomiting in the advanced stages of illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.
Moreover, a handful of regulated pharmaceuticals use chemicals derived from cannabis, such as GW Pharmaceuticals' Sativex which is approved for treating symptoms of multiple sclerosis. 
BOOST EXPORTS
From Canada, where Tilray has six facilities, the company already sells medical cannabis products to 13 countries. Portugal will help Tilray boost exports further, Kennedy said. 
""Our business plan for this facility is focused on exporting products from Portugal to other countries around the world.""
In Europe, Tilray products are already available in Germany, Croatia, Cyprus and the Czech Republic but it expects to start exporting to the United Kingdom - and potentially to France, Italy and Greece - in the next 12 months. 
Kennedy said Tilray hopes this summer to expand exports to countries such as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
According to analysis firm Prohibition Partners, the EU cannabis market will be worth 123 billion euros by 2028. 
Kennedy did not confirm how much medical marijuana Tilray plans to produce.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>","Tesla's Musk 'sees merit' in capital raise, vows profit in third quarter after large loss","By Alexandria Sage and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk suggested on Wednesday a capital raise could be imminent, as the electric vehicle maker lost $700 million in the first quarter and predicted a return to profit in the third.
Tesla plans to resolve logistics issues with global vehicle deliveries after weathering a challenging few months, also marked by staff layoffs and a public spat between Musk and U.S. financial regulators. 
Shares of Tesla, which are down 22 percent this year, were about flat after the results, which came more than an hour after they were expected. 
Musk is still battling to convince investors that demand for the Model 3, the sedan hoped to propel Tesla to sustainable profit, is ""insanely"" high, and that it can be delivered efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. Lower deliveries had added to worries over Tesla's cash situation and increased speculation a capital raise was coming soon.
On a call following results, Musk also stepped back from an earlier prediction that the company's Shanghai factory, which is currently being built, would likely produce 3,000 Model 3s per week by year's end. Instead, the so-called Gigafactory would build 1,000, or maybe 2,000 per week by the end of the year, he said.
Many analysts had predicted the company would need to raise funds for its expansion, including the Shanghai factory, the upcoming Model Y SUV, and other projects. Tesla said it ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash after paying off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in March. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XJ3Rnd)
""There is some merit to raising capital,"" responded Musk, after being asked why he had not done so yet. ""It's probably about the right time."" 
The company stood by its 2019 delivery forecast of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles and said it may produce as many as 500,000 vehicles if its China factory reaches volume production in the fourth quarter.
Tesla said a loss in its second quarter would be ""significantly"" less than the $702 million lost in the first quarter. Profit would return in the third quarter, Tesla said.
Haris Anwar, senior analyst a financial markets platform Investing.com, called guidance for the second quarter ""bleak"". ""I continue to see a very volatile 2019 for Tesla and its shares,"" Anwar said. 
TOPSY-TURVY QUARTER
Tesla's results came two days after the company hosted a self-driving event, in which Musk predicted Tesla would have over a million autonomous vehicles by next year. Some analysts perceived the presentation as a way to deflect attention from questions about demand, margin pressure, increasing competition and even Musk's ongoing battle with U.S. regulators.
On Thursday, Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to tell a federal judge the status of discussions to resolve their dispute over Musk's Twitter use. 
Heightening uncertainty during the quarter were logistics bottlenecks at international ports, price adjustments on vehicles and a surprise announcement, later reversed, to close most of Tesla's stores in order to financially offset the introduction of the $35,000 Model 3.
On Wednesday, Tesla said it planned to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles to customers in the second quarter, versus 63,000 vehicles in the first.
Musk said that Tesla would change the costly and inefficient way it was building cars, in which it produced for international markets at the start of each quarter - to leave time for longer transport - then built for North America later. A better production blend would be less taxing on the company, Musk said.
The gross profit margin on the Model 3 - a focus for investors - remained relatively steady at 20 percent.
Tesla also announced it would start offering its own insurance product in about a month to better reflect the safety of its vehicles. 
Tesla reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of $702.1 million, or $4.10 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding some items, Tesla lost $1.77 per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of a loss of 69 cents, according to data from Refinitiv. 
Shares fell less than a percent to $258 in after-hours trade.

169,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Japanese Shares on Holiday Even Before Golden Week,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s still time for a few trades this week before markets are shuttered and Japan’s investors head off for an extended Golden Week holiday. Yet you would hardly know it based on the drop in trading activity already.
Tokyo’s benchmark Topix Index hasn’t seen a one percentage point or more move in seven trading days, and daily volumes were less than 1 billion shares from Friday through Tuesday. That’s the longest such stretch of low volumes since December 2017. As traders await the Bank of Japan meeting Thursday, with one eye on the Narita Express, it remains to be seen how volumes will fare for the rest of the week.
The mixed results come as some of the steam goes out of the wider Asian rally after a hot start to 2019. While the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up 11 percent for the year, the bulk of that gain was in January.
Optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot has had to contend with increasing concerns about a global economic slowdown and recent strength in the dollar. The yen has declined over 2 percent this year.
With the BOJ expected to maintain its key rate today, there’s little impetus for traders in Japan to make any outsized wagers ahead of a 10-day holiday that will leave them out of the domestic market until May 7, while the nation celebrates the transition to a new emperor and the start of the Reiwa era.

For traders, there will be plenty of opportunities to invest once the new era dawns, as work begun during the Heisei era on longstanding issues such as corporate governance reform will continue, said Takashi Maruyama, chief investment officer of Fidelity International in Japan.
“While more companies have increased shareholder returns through steps such as higher dividends and share repurchases, there is still room for improvement,” he said in a note to clients.
Resolution on the issue of the longstanding practice of cross-shareholdings in particular is expected to come in the new era as companies improve their governance practices, he said. As cross-shareholdings diminish, corporate discipline will increase and efficiency will improve, “which should lead to higher profitability,” he added.
“The Japanese economy is facing challenges, including an aging population and the eventual exit from easy monetary policy, Maruyama said. “But the market will recognize and reward Japanese companies that improve their management, shareholder returns and asset efficiency.”

BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thailand is set to see the most funds raised from IPOs in Southeast Asia this year, with more than $5 billion expected to be garnered in the second half, sources said, as a tourist boost to the economy trumps jitters stoked by inconclusive elections.
Southeast Asia's second largest economy is expected to see listings from the retail arm of state-owned oil company PTT Pcl, the hospitality business of tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's empire, and a unit of the country's largest retailer Central Group, people familiar with the matter said.
First-time share sales from these companies and others could make it the largest haul for the country in six years, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak to the media.
Investors are focusing on the country's stable economic growth and currency and do not see any big risk from political uncertainty. Preliminary election results show Pheu Thai, the leading anti-junta party, has won the most constituency seats, while the pro-army Palang Pracharat gained the most votes, but each is unable to form a government on its own.
Low interest rates and a hunt for high-yielding assets are driving investors to allocate money for equities, fund managers said.
""People are waiting and IPOs will sell,"" said Narongchai Akrasanee, chairman of MFC Asset Management.
Tourism is a strong pillar of Thailand's growth, with the country expecting visitor arrivals to rise by 7.5 percent this year. Thailand's finance minister said last week that the country will introduce economic measures worth about 20 billion baht ($624 million) to boost consumption, tourism and help low-income earners.
Last year, Vietnam was the biggest market for IPOs in Southeast Asia, with listings there raising $3.4 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.
Bankers say 2019 is set to be Thailand's strongest year for IPOs since 2013, when they raised over $6 billion. In 2018, Thai listings raised $2.5 billion after mopping up $3.8 billion in the previous year, Refinitiv data showed.
""One positive in Thailand is that domestic investor liquidity is extremely healthy,"" said Ho Cheun Hon, Credit Suisse's Singapore-based head of Southeast Asia equity capital markets.
""Assuming the final election outcome does not impact consumer and investor sentiment negatively, we are hopeful that market conditions in the second half of the year will be constructive for the strong Thai pipeline to push through,"" he said.PTT Oil & Retail, which includes gas stations, coffee shops and convenience stores, is expected to kick off its IPO process after the election results and could raise about $2 billion, sources said.
Mall operator Central Group's retail arm is also slated for a stock market flotation later this year and could raise $1 billion-$2 billion, sources said.
Asset World Corp, the hospitality arm of TCC Group, which owns office buildings, luxury hotels and shopping arcades, plans to launch a $1 billion-$1.5 billion IPO in the second half of the year, IFR reported in January.
PTT, TCC and Central did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
While there is short-term volatility in markets, Thailand's benchmark index is trading at close to its five-year historical PE ratio, so IPO plans should go ahead if there is more clarity in politics in the second half of 2019, said Nunmanus Piamthipmanus, SCB Asset Management's chief investment officer.
Some investors, however, cautioned that issuers had to ensure IPOs were not overpriced.
""Competition and supply in offices, hotels and malls make these sectors challenging,"" says Thidasiri Srisamith, chief investment officer at Kasikorn Asset Management.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",U.S. biofuel trade group asks judge to halt new EPA small refinery waivers: documents,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. biofuels trade group asked a federal court on Wednesday to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from giving refiners new waivers from the country's biofuels law until the agency reverts to the tougher criteria it used to assess applications before Donald Trump's presidency, according to court papers. 
The waivers can exempt small refineries — those with a production capacity of 75,000 barrels per day or less - from the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates U.S. refiners blend biofuels into the fuel pool or buy compliance credits from those who do. 
Trump's EPA has vastly expanded the biofuel waiver program to save the oil industry money, angering Midwest farmers who say the policy destroys demand for corn-based ethanol and other biofuels at a time they are already struggling - putting the administration in the center of a fight between two key constituencies.
""We want to return to normalcy,"" Michael McAdams, head of the Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA), which filed the injunction in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, said in an interview on Wednesday. ""My members will continue to suffer irreparable harm unless the EPA changes its ways."" 
The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard is meant to help farmers by requiring refiners to blend certain volumes of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase credits from those that do. But the RFS also allows small refineries to apply for exemptions to the regulation if they can prove that compliance would cause them financial harm.
For 2017, the Trump administration's EPA granted 35 exemptions to small refineries without denying any applications, up from seven exemptions issued in the last year of the Obama administration, according to EPA data.
That has reduced the costs of credits some refiners such as  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), PBF Energy Inc and HollyFrontier Corp must buy in order to comply with the RFS, saving them hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The EPA has argued it was forced to use a more liberal assessment process for waiver applications after a U.S. Appeals Court said in 2017 that the agency had been too strict in granting waivers during the Obama administration.
But ABFA has argued the agency illegally changed its process of assessing applications, making it possible for refineries owned by major oil companies like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) to secure them.
The EPA, which typically does not comment on pending litigation, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
ABFA asked the court to stop the EPA from granting the next round of exemptions for the year 2018 - due to come any day now - until its case challenging the 2017 waivers is resolved or the agency decides to go back to its old way of assessing applications.
""We can't put the toothpaste back in the tube if the 2018 exemptions are approved using an illegal scoring system,"" said McAdams.
According to ABFA's complaint, the Trump administration's EPA stopped considering whether a refinery could remain profitable while complying with the RFS, and instead began considering only whether compliance would cause a “disproportionate” financial impact, an easier hurdle to clear. 
In 24 out of 48 recent cases, the EPA granted waivers to refiners that the government believed would have remained competitive and profitable if they had been forced to comply with the RFS, ABFA alleged in the court documents, citing EPA documents outlining their decisions.

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday denied a request by Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board to extend a looming deadline to file claims, the latest hurdle for its plan to recoup billions of dollars paid to bondholders of potentially invalid debt issued by the island's government.
Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy cases, declined to extend a two-year statute of limitations that runs out on May 2, saying it was ""not something I'm persuaded this court is allowed to do."" Edward Weisfelner, a lawyer for the board, said this could mean the board could be forced to file hundreds of lawsuits by that deadline against bondholders in order to preserve its claims.
The board, which filed bankruptcy for the U.S. commonwealth in May 2017 in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations, had requested more time, arguing that the judge had to rule first on the validity of certain debt before claims against scores of bondholders could be filed. Extending the deadline would have avoided unnecessary and costly litigation, according to the board. 
The judge also rejected a request by a creditors committee to pursue claims for fraud and other infractions against advisers, underwriters and public officials involved in potentially illegal Puerto Rico debt sales. The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, which includes labor unions, as well as suppliers and contractors to the Puerto Rican government, argued that the board would not pursue these claims. 
But Weisfelner told Swain 27 underwriters, nine law firms, and five accounting firms were being targeted for fraud and other claims. 
In her denial, Swain said that ""the ability to propose a confirmable plan of adjustment"" was at stake and that the oversight board had not consented to the committee's motion.
The court has yet to decide on the board's January motion to void more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 on the basis they were issued in violation of debt limits in Puerto Rico's constitution. Creditor groups involved in the bankruptcy have also sought to invalidate debt issued by the Public Buildings Authority and bonds sold for the island's Employees Retirement System. 
Several banks were ordered last week to comply with the board's request for customer information that would be used in recovering bond payments.
During Wednesday's court hearing, Martin Bienenstock, an attorney for the board, told Swain that negotiations to restructure about $9 billion of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's (PREPA) debt were ""very promising."" He also reported that transmission and distribution contracts with private companies are expected to be finalized in 2020's second quarter.

Meanwhile, the oversight board this week filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court in an effort to overturn a Feb. 15 appeals court ruling that determined its members were unconstitutionally appointed. The board also asked the First Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the 90-day deadline it set to allow President Donald Trump and the Senate to constitutionally validate the appointments or reconstitute the board.

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is taking control of the supply chain for Angus beef sold in some of its stores, cutting out meat processors as the company looks to offer higher quality products in an intensely competitive grocery industry.
The world’s largest retailer said on Wednesday that the move would allow it to ensure supplies of quality Angus beef and meet demands from customers who want to know the origin of their meat.
Normally, Walmart would buy Angus beef from companies like  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Cargill Inc.
Walmart has now arranged to source cattle from Texas rancher Bob McClaren of Prime Pursuits and 44 Farms, who said the retailer will sell no-hormones-added Black Angus beef.
The cattle will be fed at a feedyard that specializes in avoiding hormones, slaughtered in Kansas and packaged in Georgia before the beef hits shelves in about 500 Walmart stores in the southeastern United States.
""Having visibility to the end-to-end process lets us know we are helping our customers bring a consistently great piece of meat to their table every time they buy with us,"" Scott Neal, Walmart's senior vice president of meat, said in a statement. 
Tyson and Cargill said they supported Walmart's project. Tyson shares slipped 0.9 percent, while Walmart shares rose 0.4 percent.
Walmart's efforts to exert more control over its meat supply come after it switched to selling high-grade Angus beef in 2017.
The retailer's latest actions target younger consumers who want more transparency in food production and no growth hormones in their meat, said Cassie Fish, a beef industry expert who formerly worked at Tyson. 
""It's a play for the millennials,"" she said.
Walmart has separately increased its control over its dairy supply by opening a processing plant in Indiana that supplies private-label milk to stores.
Rival Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) is meanwhile building a chicken plant in Fremont, Nebraska, that will serve its stores.
""There appears to be an emerging trend of backwards integration into the ag supply chain,"" said Jeremy Scott, an analyst at Mizuho.
""This is a unique approach by Walmart to pursue a direct link from calf to plate, but it comes with plenty of risk and new variables.""
Walmart would struggle to create a supply chain that covers all its beef needs, Vertical Group analyst Heather Jones said, so the retailer will still need to buy some meat from Tyson.
Processors such as Tyson buy cattle from feedlots in broad geographic areas and own multiple plants that slaughter beef for sale by retailers and restaurants.
Tyson also recently announced a program to trace the origins of beef raised without antibiotics or added hormones.

""We've gone through several years now of very strong demand for beef,"" said David Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. ""A big part of that is consumers' demand for higher quality.""

Revenue also fell short of forecasts.
The company, which makes electric-powered vehicles, reported a loss of $2.90 per share on revenue of $4.54 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a loss of just $0.87 on revenue of $5.46 billion. That compared to a loss of $3.35 per share on revenue of $3.41 billion in the same period a year earlier.
But despite the big miss, Tesla shares rose 1.14% in after-hours trading. They'd fallen 2% in regular trading and are down about 22% this year.
The company had reported earlier that it was having problems with vehicle deliveries. In its vehicle deliveries update, the company said unforeseen challenges necessitated number of vehicle deliveries to shift to the second quarter.
But the company also reaffirmed its full-year deliveries guidance with the report.
""Although we are driving towards higher internal goals, we reaffirm our prior guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019, representing an increase of approximately 45% to 65% compared to 2018,"" Tesla said.
The automaker said it would return to a profit in the third quarter of 2019 after racking up two consecutive losses in the first half of the year as it launched a cheaper version of its Model 3 sedan.
The company, which Wall Street suspects may soon have to raise more cash, said it ended the quarter with just $2.2 billion in cash, after paying off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in March.
""As the impact of higher deliveries and cost reduction take full effect, we expect to return to profitability in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2,"" Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a letter to investors.
The company has weathered a challenging few months, marked by a sharp drop in the number of vehicles delivered to global customers during the quarter and a public spat between Musk and financial regulators.

The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, last year. Goldman is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role. The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying the criminal activities of Leissner and Ng were hidden from the bank's management. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Jake Siewert said in statement on Wednesday: ""We do not believe that such a charge would be warranted by the facts of the case or the law, particularly because senior management was unaware of the criminal activity by Mr. Leissner and his associate who took extraordinary efforts to hide their part in the illegal scheme from management, compliance, and legal functions at the firm.""
The staff recommendation by prosecutors is now being considered by senior officials at the Justice Department, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Goldman's shares fell 2 percent following the report.
According to prosecutors, the investment bank generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.
Prosecutors described the bank's system of internal accounting controls as ""easily circumvented"" and said its culture in Southeast Asia was ""highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.""

The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.

Effective immediately, Alex Leite will be executive director of its sugar trading division Tereos Commodities Sugar, it said in a statement on Wednesday, while two new executives will be appointed under a new corporate structure that will entail ""a clear distinction between the raw and white sugar books,"" the company said.
Tereos, the world's second-largest sugar producer, said Omar Al-Dahhan will lead raw sugar and Pat Dean the white sugar unit.
Tereos Commodities Sugar ""had reached a size and stage in its growth requiring additional focus to optimize its presence and results,"" it said.
Tereos, which is forecasting falling profit this year due to a slump in global prices for sugar, has been carrying out an extensive reshuffle in recent weeks that saw its chief financial officer departing, among others.

The Oslo-listed airline has shaken up the long-haul market by offering cut-price transatlantic fares, but its rapid expansion has left it with hefty losses and high debts.
In total, the announced restructurings and postponements of Boeing and Airbus aircraft delivery will reduce capital expenditure for 2019 and 2020 by $2.1 billion, the company said.
Norwegian said it would provide updated total capex guidance on Thursday, when it reports first-quarter results.
The company said its Dublin-based subsidiary Arctic Aviation Assets DAC had reached an agreement with Boeing to postpone delivery of 14 737 MAX aircraft which were originally due in 2020 and 2021.
In a separate statement, it also said that the subsidiary had agreed in principle with Airbus to restructure delivery schedule of both A320neos and A321LRs.
The deal with Airbus would reduce capital expenditure by approximately $670 million for 2019 and 2020, and $2.4 billion over the next five years, Norwegian added.
Those savings come on top of the reductions from the previously announced postponements, it said.
On Feb. 6, Norwegian announced postponing deliveries of 12 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft from 2020 to 2023 and 2024, and four Airbus 321LR aircraft from 2019 to 2020, and on April 10 announced further postponements, including Airbus 320neos. 
At the end of 2018, Norwegian had multi-year commitments to take a total of 63 A320neos, 30 A321LR and 92 Boeing 737 MAX 8, its annual report published on April 10 showed.

The company said in the report it expected in 2019 to take delivery of five new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which it uses on its intercontinental routes, as previously planned.

Surescripts said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" by the lawsuit and had been cooperating with the agency.
The FTC accused Surescripts, which provides a range of electronic records and prescribing services to doctors, pharmacists and patients, of requiring long-term exclusivity from customers and punishing them with high prices if they bought some prescriptions from another company.
Surescripts provides a network that allows health care providers to send prescriptions to pharmacies electronically. It also contacts patients' insurance companies to determine benefit eligibility.
""Surescripts’ illegal contracts denied customers and, ultimately, patients, the benefits of competition - including lower prices, increased output, thriving innovation, higher quality, and more customer choice,"" said Bruce Hoffman, the head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
The FTC also accused Surescripts of illegally pressuring a corporate customer, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc, to prevent them from taking their business to a competitor.
Surescripts Chief Executive Tom Skelton said in an email statement that the company has reduced the cost of electronic prescribing by 70 percent since 2009. 
""We are making an important change to our e-prescribing business agreements with pharmacies by removing the loyalty provisions in those contracts. This step addresses one of the FTC’s chief concerns,"" Skelton added in his statement.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 03:46PM ET</span>",U.S. judge suspends Blackstone lawsuit against Italy's RCS over Milan HQ,"MILAN (Reuters) - A New York judge has put on hold a lawsuit by U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP against Italian publisher RCS Mediagroup over the disputed sale of real estate assets, pending the outcome of an arbitration in Italy.
The case centers on RCS' historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($134 million) in 2013. Both companies now claim ownership.
RCS Chairman Urbano Cairo, who became RCS' controlling shareholder after the 2013 deal, has said Blackstone took control of the headquarters at too low a price, while RCS faced financial difficulties, and the transaction should be voided.
Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property, and improperly blocked it from selling the property to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE.
Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday put Blackstone's lawsuit on hold pending the outcome of the Italian arbitration. That process could take one year.
Aaron Marks, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis representing Blackstone, said his client would pursue its claims to the end, whether in New York or Italy.
""We are entirely confident in our legal case and have no intention of settling,"" Marks said in an emailed statement.
Michael Carlinsky, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing RCS, said: ""We are pleased with the court's decision to respect the Italian arbitration and allow it to go forward in Italy.""
RCS, the owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings in Milan last year to nullify the 2013 sale under Italian law.
The next hearing in that case has been scheduled for Sept. 16, according to two sources close to the matter.
In the New York case, Blackstone had argued that the planned sale to Allianz was held up by claims from RCS that the transaction was ""null and void.""
The dispute has alarmed some real estate investors, who have said foreign investment in Italy could suffer as a result.

198,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street's Biggest Bear Still Sees S&P 500 Pain. Just Not as Much,"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Cecchini, Wall Street’s biggest equity bear, has been humbled but not convinced by the market rally.
In a week when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, the global chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 2,500 from 2,390. The new forecast represents a 15 percent drop from the current level, still putting him as the most pessimistic among 25 strategists tracked by Bloomberg.
Stocks have surged this year, sending the S&P 500 up 17 percent, as investors jubilate over a dovish Federal Reserve and bet a profit slowdown will be short-lived. Such optimism is misplaced, according to Cecchini.
“We do not foresee an inflection in U.S. economic growth or S&P earnings growth in the second half as global growth continues to slow and costs rise,” he said. “We also do not foresee a Fed cut as likely. With slower growth and a Fed that is slow to cut, we think equities will struggle in the second half.”
The reluctance to embrace stocks is echoing sentiment in a market where many see the momentum unlikely to continue given persistent uncertainties over corporate earnings and monetary policy. Hedge funds have largely sat out the rally, while professional forecasters see little room for gains in coming months. The median forecast from strategists points to 2,950 in December, slightly above the S&P 500’s current level of 2,931.
Cecchini joined a growing list of prognosticators who have been forced to chase the rally. At least two other strategists have turned more bullish over the past month, including Tom Lee at Fundstrat and Credit Suisse’s Jonathan Golub."

205,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 02:12PM ET</span>",Bayer asks California appeals court to throw out $78 million Roundup verdict,"By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) on Wednesday asked a California appellate court to throw out a $78 million judgment it was ordered to pay to a school groundskeeper who claimed the company's weed killers gave him cancer.
In a filing in California's Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, the company said that there was ""no evidence"" that glyphosate, a chemical found in the company's Roundup and Ranger Pro products, could cause cancer.
""Bayer stands behind these products and will continue to vigorously defend them,"" the company said in a news release.
The widely-used weed killers are made by  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which Bayer acquired last year for $63 billion.
The company said that if the court did not rule in its favor, it should at least order a new trial, arguing that a lower court judge had improperly prevented jurors from hearing evidence that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and foreign regulators had deemed glyphosate not likely carcinogenic to humans. 
A lawyer for the groundskeeper, Dewayne Johnson, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Johnson sued Monsanto in 2016. In August 2018, following a trial in the Superior Court of California in San Francisco, a jury awarded him $39 million in compensatory damages and $250 million in punitive damages, a total of $289 million.
The verdict, which marked the first such decision against Monsanto, wiped 10 percent off Bayer's value, and shares have since dropped nearly 30 percent from their pre-verdict value.
Judge Suzanne Bolanos, who oversaw the trial, then issued a tentative opinion saying she planned to strike the entire punitive damages award because there was no evidence Monsanto acted with malice. Following a hearing last October, she instead cut the award to $39 million, for a total judgment of $78 million.
In another brief filed with the appeals court on Wednesday, Bayer said that decision came after newspaper articles and emails from five jurors in the case meant to ""pressure"" Bolanos to uphold the punitive damages award.
Bayer, which faces more than 11,000 U.S. lawsuits over glyphosate, says decades of scientific studies and real-world use have shown glyphosate to be safe for human use.

While the EPA and regulators from several other countries have said glyphosate was not likely to cause cancer, the cancer unit of the World Health Organization in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Britain's Embrace of Huawei Is Really About Brexit,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision not to ban Huawei Technologies Co. outright was the easier choice. That doesn’t mean it was the right one.
The U.S. has been vociferously pushing for countries to exclude telecommunications equipment made by the Chinese firm, saying it’s vulnerable to hacking by state-sponsored actors from its home nation. But Huawei also has some of the most advanced gear for next-generation 5G networks. It’s a conundrum.
May had a case for ignoring considerable pressure from President Donald Trump. First, her own intelligence advisers – the National Cyber Security Centre – have stopped short of publicly advocating a ban.
Second, Britain’s telecoms industry, whose most prominent firms are BT Group (LON:BT) Plc and  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc, is adamant that forbidding the use of Huawei’s 5G equipment will slow down the rollout of new networks.
Third, the U.K. wants to maintain a strong trading relationship with Bejing. That would be more difficult were Britain to outlaw products from one of China’s most prominent companies. It also wants to remain a hub for technology investment after its split from the European Union, and a lack of 5G networks could hinder that.
There are, nevertheless, grounds for skepticism regarding the last two points.
Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Nick Read is among those who have said publicly that there is little immediate demand for 5G networks. This somewhat undermines the urgency of retaining access to Huawei gear. For telecoms operators, Huawei’s importance is likely as much to do with providing competition to the supplier’s European rivals Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB and Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) as it is with the pace of 5G rollout. More competition means carriers pay lower prices for the equipment.
And if developing next-generation networks really isn’t of immediate importance, a lack of them shouldn’t make a huge difference to technology investment in Britain.
Now consider the risks May faces after her decision. Chinese state actors might seek to access and disrupt Britain’s critical infrastructure and secure networks. Perhaps more significantly in the short term, she might anger Trump, who could make good on his threat to withhold intelligence from the U.K. 
You can see how the prime minister arrived at the choice that she did. The risks to the economy seem to have carried the day.
Huawei equipment will be restricted from the core parts of the network, the hubs and servers through which data is transferred, but allowed in non-core parts such as antennae, according to the Daily Telegraph. But that distinction might prove moot, given the distributed nature of 5G, where antennae can more easily sidestep core parts of the network and communicate with each other directly.
May is clearly trying to thread the eye of the needle. She’ll hope that excluding Huawei gear from the key part of the network might keep the U.S. happy, and allowing it elsewhere might avoid aggravating the Chinese.
Her choice seems to have been dictated by the pressures of Brexit. Were the divorce from the European Union not on its way, perhaps it would be easier for May to succumb to U.S. pressure and crack down on Huawei. But now that Britain will be standing on its own, it needs to keep China as a trade partner more than it did when it was a member of the EU. 
The prime minister is leaving Britain’s critical infrastructure more vulnerable to Chinese incursions. But May probably feels she didn’t have another choice."

Occidental proposed acquiring Anadarko for $76 per share -- $38 in cash and the rest in stock. The offer values the exploration-and-production company at $57 billion including debt. That's above Chevron's $65-per-share agreement to acquire the company.
Anadarko (NYSE:APC) rallied more than 11%, Occidental (NYSE:OXY) fell 2% and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) fell more than 2%.
Occidental's efforts to acquire Anadarko have been rebuffed several times. The latest offer suggests that Occidental it is prepared to engage in bidding war with Chevron to land Anadarko.
In March, Occidental laid out three acquisition proposals for Anadarko, in which it made the case that its offer represented both superior strategic and financial value.
""Occidental believes its proposal is superior both financially and strategically for Anadarko’s shareholders, creating a global energy leader with the scale and geographic diversification to drive growth and deliver compelling value and returns to the shareholders of both companies,"" the company said in a statement Wednesday.
The tie-up would create a production powerhouse and deliver $1.5 billion of cost cuts, improving free cash flow by $3.5 billion a year by 2021, according to Occidental, which is $1.5 billion more than the value Chevron believes it can extract from the deal.
""Anadarko has great assets,"" Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub said in a interview on CNBC Wednesday. ""We are the right acquirer ... because we can get the most out of the shale.""
Attention now turns to Chevron as many anticipate that the oil major may up its bid for Anadarko amid plans to enhance its upstream portfolio and strengthen its positions in large shale, deepwater and natural-gas basins."

211,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Lawyer to Trace 1MDB Money Trail to Argue Najib Was Manipulated,"(Bloomberg) -- The lawyer representing Najib Razak will follow a money trail from a former unit of 1MDB to argue that the former Malaysian prime minister was manipulated.
Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing over his role in the troubled state fund, saying he was misled by others, such as fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low. Najib’s facing his first trial that revolves around seven of the total 42 charges laid against him.
His lawyer Harvinder Singh argued that 103 million ringgit ($25 million) flowed from SRC International Sdn, a former unit of 1MDB, to its subsidiaries and that 42 million ringgit ended up in Najib’s accounts. That left more than 60 million ringgit unaccounted for, Harvinder said in court on Wednesday.
Najib “was manipulated by certain people, and they have gained tremendously,” Harvinder said.
The judge allowed Harvinder to explore one of the seven money trails the lawyer brought up and ordered the witness, an officer at Affin Bank Bhd., to prepare the relevant documents. Prosecutors had objected to Harvinder’s suggestion, saying it would mean having to “go on a wild goose chase” as the case is only related to the 42 million ringgit stated in the charges.
More than a dozen witnesses have testified at the trial, including central bank officers and a number of recipients of checks from Najib, such as members of his party, a specialist plumber and an interior designer. Earlier on Wednesday, the court heard from a witness that Najib issued a 2.5 million ringgit check to a law firm with the funds intended for Habibul Rahman, a former Malaysia Airlines board member.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",Factbox: Who will succeed Carney to run Britain's central bank?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is searching for a new governor of the Bank of England to succeed Mark Carney in early 2020.
Finance minister Philip Hammond is hoping that concerns about Brexit will not deter potential applicants.
Below are possible contenders to run the BoE which oversees the world's fifth-biggest economy and its huge finance industry. 
ANDREW BAILEY
The former deputy BoE governor was tipped by analysts as Carney's most likely successor. But delays to the search, after Carney extended his time in London, have raised questions about whether Hammond sees him as the best candidate.
Bailey, 60, was deputy governor with a focus on banks before becoming chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, a markets regulator.
While at the BoE, Bailey helped to steer Britain's banks through the global financial crisis.
Heading the FCA is fraught with risks. Lawmakers criticised Bailey for not publishing all of a report into alleged misconduct by bank RBS (LON:RBS). Bailey cited privacy restrictions.
As FCA boss, Bailey sits on important panels at the BoE that oversee banks. Although he has never been interest-rate setter, he once ran the BoE international economic analysis team.
RAGHURAM RAJAN
Rajan, 56, headed the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016, and was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund between 2003 and 2006 when he warned of the risk of a financial crisis. 
Now a professor at Chicago Booth business school, Rajan has published a book on dissatisfaction with markets and the state - touching on some of the underlying issues behind Brexit.
Rajan unexpectedly did not seek a renewal of his three-year term at the RBI, having faced hostility from some sections of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party who disliked his less nationalist stance and brief forays into political territory.
Rajan declined to comment when asked by Reuters last week whether he would consider a return to active policymaking.
MINOUCHE SHAFIK
Egyptian-born Shafik, 57, was a BoE deputy governor between 2014 and 2017, in charge of markets and banking, including the central bank's asset purchase programme. She quit the job early to become director of the London School of Economics.
Between 2008 and 2011 she was the top civil servant at Britain's ministry for overseas aid and was then deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, where she represented the fund in the Greek debt crisis.
Shafik would become the first woman to head the BoE, and was only its second female deputy governor.
BEN BROADBENT AND DAVE RAMSDEN
Broadbent, 54, and Ramsden, 55, are deputy governors for monetary policy and for markets and banking respectively.
Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist who trained as a classical pianist, is respected for his economic analysis but has less experience on banking oversight.
Ramsden was the Treasury's chief economic advisor.
The two other BoE deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe and Sam Woods, are less likely contenders. Woods focuses mostly on financial regulation while Cunliffe - a former British ambassador to the European Union - would be aged 66 at the start of the term which usually runs for eight years.
SHRITI VADERA
Vadera, 56, has no central banking experience but is seen as a contender due to her current role as non-executive chairwoman of Santander (MC:SAN) UK, one of Britain's biggest banks, and her time as a junior business minister during the financial crisis.
Vadera served as a minister from 2007 to 2009 after a career in investment banking and a period at the finance ministry.
In 2008, she was part of a small group of ministers and officials who devised a plan worth hundreds of billions of pounds in loan guarantees to keep high-street banks in business.
ANDY HALDANE
The BoE's chief economist, Haldane has developed a reputation for floating unconventional ideas, including the possibility that music apps such as Spotify and multiplayer online games might give central bankers just as a good a sense of what is going on in the economy as traditional surveys. 
In 2012, he praised the anti-capitalist Occupy movement for suggesting new ways to fix the shortcomings of global finance. Haldane has experience of both sides of the BoE, having served as executive director for financial stability, overseeing the risks to the economy from the banking system. But he might be seen as too much of a maverick to take the job of governor.
A LABOUR PARTY GOVERNOR?
The prospect of the left-wing Labour Party taking power has grown as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to break the Brexit impasse.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his would-be finance minister John McDonnell are socialists and have in the past proposed that the BoE should fund investment in infrastructure, a big change from its current focus on inflation. 

Former members of Labour's economic advisory committee included U.S. academic and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz and Ann Pettifor, a British economist who is an austerity critic, and former BoE rate-setter David Blanchflower.

218,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>",Saudi Bourse Chief Sees Foreign Bets in Market Soaring,"(Bloomberg) -- The chief of Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange predicts ownership of equities by foreigners will triple by 2022, driven by flows from index trackers, as the country awaits the listing of its crown-jewel, Saudi Aramco.
“Since we opened up the market, we wanted to make sure we have enough companies, diversified sectors and industries,” Khalid Al Hussan, chief executive officer of the $573 billion Saudi stock exchange, said in an interview at a conference in Riyadh on Wednesday. “We are ready for the Aramco IPO, but as they change their plans, it gives more time for the exchange to develop.”
Foreigners are net buyers of about $4.3 billion in Saudi shares this year, as they anticipate the upgrade of the country within emerging-market benchmarks by MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell. International investors will double their estimated holdings to 10 percent of the market by 2020, rising to 15 percent by 2022, Al Hussan estimates. They were initially allowed to trade shares directly in Riyadh about four years ago.
The buying spree this year contrasts with a sharp sell-off by foreigners after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, a time when funds tied to the government stepped up purchases of equities and supported the market. Now, investors including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Man Group Plc are making clear they’re keen to invest in the biggest equities market of the Arab World.
“The more standardized the Saudi market to international norms, the easier it is for us all to trade,” Man Group CEO Luke Ellis said during a panel at the conference. He added that the quality of companies that have held initial public offerings in the nation has been “higher than in other places.”

Other IPOs
Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, may access the equity markets “sooner than you think,” Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said during the conference. The IPO, previously expected for last year and later delayed to 2021, “could slip a little bit, could come forward,” he said.
Meanwhile, there are four initial public offerings scheduled for this year, which “should be one of the best in the past five” for new deals, Al Hussan said. Arabian Centres, the lifestyle mall operator part of the Fawaz Alhokair Group, is one of them and the first from the kingdom to do an offering under Regulation S and Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act, which is familiar to American investors.
The tech company, Al Moammar Information Systems, raised 216 million riyals ($58 million) in an offering this year and climbed 4.9 percent on its trading debut earlier on Wednesday.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>","Boeing abandons financial outlook, sees $1 billion in extra cost on 737 MAX","By Ankit Ajmera and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Wednesday abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production due to the grounding of its fastest-selling 737 MAX jet after two fatal plane crashes in five months had cost it at least $1 billion so far.
The world's largest planemaker is facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history following the disasters on Lion Air in Indonesia on Oct. 29 and another on Ethiopian Airlines on March 10, which together killed all 346 on board. 
Chicago-based Boeing is now reckoning with a blow to its reputation and the financial cost of getting the planes back in the air. It met sharply lowered Wall Street profit estimates, largely due to stopping deliveries of the 737 MAX jets and a slowdown in production.
The production slowdown alone has cost it $1 billion so far, the company said, because the lower rate means the planemaker has to pay more for parts, which are priced according to the volume Boeing buys.
Boeing also booked unspecified charges related to developing a MAX software fix and pilot training. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on a conference call that Boeing has confidence in its software fix and expects a certification flight with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in the ""near term"" after completing more than 135 test and production flights. 
""The timing of return to service for that MAX will continue to be paced by ongoing work with global regulators and our customers,"" Muilenburg said. ""If there's something that we can do to make airplane development programs or the certification process better and safer, we will pursue it.""
A fuller picture of how Boeing plans to repair its image with the flying public and stem further financial damage will not emerge until the end of the second-quarter as 737 production cuts did not begin until mid-April.
Muilenburg said the company did not see any changes to the underlying certification process for its all-new 777X twin-aisle jetliner in light of the MAX reviews and said the program remained on track for delivery in 2020. Boeing also continues to work ""in parallel"" on plans for a new mid-sized airplane, although Muilenburg stressed the 737's return was a higher priority. 
He also defended his role as both CEO and chairman of Boeing after calls from some shareholders that the jobs be divided. 
""We think that is the right, most effective structure for our company,"" he said. ""And I think that's, again, showing it to be the case even in the midst of this challenging situation.""
Boeing shares were up 1.3 percent. They are still down about 10 percent since the Ethiopian Airlines crash, wiping almost $25 billion off the company's market value. 
SOFTWARE UPGRADE COMING
The crashes caused regulators worldwide to ground the 737 MAX and triggered investigations into the aircraft's development by federal transportation authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Although safety experts have raised some questions over crew performance in both crashes, attention has focused on anti-stall software known as MCAS, which Boeing has acknowledged was a common link in the separate chains of events leading to both crashes.
Muilenburg insisted on Wednesday that ""there was no surprise or gap or unknown here or something that somehow slipped through the certification process"" but added that a board committee would review the company's aircraft development processes.
""We know exactly how the airplane was designed. We know exactly how it was certified,"" he said. ""We've taken the time to understand that. That has led to the software update that we've been implementing and testing and we're very confident that when the fleet comes back up, the MAX will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly."" 
Boeing cut production of the jets following the MAX grounding to 42 aircraft per month, down from 52, and its operating cash flow in the first quarter was around $350 million lower than a year earlier. 
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Boeing told some 737 MAX owners it was targeting U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval of its software fix as early as the third week of May and the ending of the grounding of the aircraft around mid-July as it resumes building 52 aircraft per month. 
Boeing also took an impairment charge at its Boeing Capital financing unit and removed 210 aircraft from its order backlog to reflect concerns about customer credit quality.
It did not disclose the name of the airline involved but the move came days after India's Jet Airways halted operations after lenders rejected a plea for emergency funds.
Boeing said it would issue a new financial forecast when it has more clarity around the issues surrounding the 737 MAX. In January, it said it expected full-year revenue of $109.5 billion to $111.5 billion and core earnings per share between $19.90 and $20.10.
The company repurchased $2.3 billion of its shares in the latest quarter, all of which occurred prior to mid-March. Boeing bought back $9 billion of its stock last year. 
First-quarter operating cash flow declined to $2.79 billion, from $3.14 billion, missing the Wall Street's average estimate of $2.82 billion.
Revenue fell 2 percent to $22.92 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $22.98 billion.

Excluding certain items, Boeing said its core earnings fell to $3.16 per share, in the quarter from $3.64 per share, a year earlier. That matched analysts' average estimate.

WASHINGTON - In a decision that could further help companies limit damages in disputes with workers, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled against a California man who was the victim of an online scam and sought to bring claims against his employer on behalf of a group of workers instead of just himself.
In a 5-4 decision with the conservative justices in the majority and the liberals in dissent, the court overturned a lower court ruling that had allowed for the collective arbitration of the workers' claims against lighting retailer Lamps Plus, Inc.
Lamps Plus warehouse employee Frank Varela filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of current and former employees accusing it of negligence, breach of contract and invasion of privacy after a hacker obtained his and other workers' personal information from the company.
Varela said that after the breach a fraudulent tax return was filed in his name.
The Supreme Court agreed with the company, which had argued that the arbitration must be conducted on an individual basis only. The decision builds upon a series of others in recent years by the Supreme Court endorsing the power of arbitration and curbing class-action claims of various types. 
Last year, in a blow to employee rights, the justices upheld the legality of compelling workers to sign arbitration agreements waiving their right to bring class-action claims.
The Lamps Plus case hinged on whether courts can allow arbitration as a group even if a contract does not explicitly provide for the collective arbitration of claims. Under a law called the Federal Arbitration Act, which governs dispute resolution proceedings through arbitration, they cannot, the court said. 
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said class-wide arbitration ""undermines the most important benefits"" of individual-only proceedings envisioned by that law including lower cost and quicker dispute resolution. 
Liberal justices on Wednesday said the ambiguous agreement should have been interpreted in the employees' favor, as required by California law, and denounced the majority's continued rulings against group legal actions. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg criticized ""how treacherously the court has strayed"" from the principle that arbitration is about consent between parties, not coercion. Ginsburg said that in recent years the court has used the federal arbitration law to deny employees and consumers the power to counter violations of their legal rights by powerful entities.
Critics have said arbitration can make it tougher to root out misconduct such as discrimination within companies because the proceedings generally are kept private.
Businesses often aim to resolve claims through arbitration rather than litigation in court, which is harder to fight and can lead to hefty damages awards by juries. Businesses also prefer to handle disputes with individuals - instead of groups in class-action proceedings - to further minimize damages. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 ruled that the claims could move forward as a group, prompting the company's appeal to the Supreme Court.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 11:37AM ET</span>",AT&T misses revenue estimates as pay-TV subscribers bleed away,"By Sheila Dang and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's first-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates on Wednesday after it lost subscribers in nearly all of its main businesses except wireless, where it paid heavily to gain customers through price promotions.
AT&T lost a net 544,000 premium TV subscribers, a category that includes DirecTV satellite and U-verse television customers. Analysts had expected a loss of 385,000 customers across DirecTV and U-verse, according to research firm FactSet.
Pay-TV providers have struggled to keep customers as viewers move to streaming services like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). AT&T has launched its own streaming service, but that too lost customers in the quarter.
Total revenue for the quarter rose nearly 18 percent to $44.83 billion but fell short of expectations of $45.11 billion. 
Revenue in AT&T's wireless business was hurt by aggressive smartphone promotions. The company has tried to reduce its dependency on its phone business, which now brings in roughly 40 percent of total operating revenue, by adding media content through its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner.
""Altogether, AT&T's collection of assets remains challenged,"" Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note on Wednesday. AT&T's business wireline segment saw declines in the top and bottom line, and even WarnerMedia trends ""were just okay,"" Chaplin wrote. 
AT&T's WarnerMedia unit, which includes Turner and premium TV channel HBO, reported revenue of $8.38 billion in the quarter, but that was short of analysts' estimates of $8.45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company added a net 80,000 phone subscribers, beating analysts' forecast of a loss of 44,000 subscribers, as it leaned on the smartphone promotions to combat competition in a saturated U.S. market.
But Mobility, AT&T's largest segment and which includes its wireless business, had revenue of $17.57 billion during the quarter, missing estimates of $17.65 billion, as those promotions hurt revenue for the unit.
AT&T shares were down 3.9 percent at $30.84 on Wednesday.
Postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer defections, was 0.93 percent during the first quarter, up from 0.84 percent in the previous year.
AT&T's entertainment segment, which includes satellite TV provider DirecTV, has been in continuous decline. Revenue from the segment fell nearly 1 percent to $11.33 billion.
AT&T also continued to lose subscribers for its DirecTV Now streaming service, which shed a net 83,000 customers during the quarter as viewers abandoned the service after their introductory price promotion plans ended. 
""AT&T’s first-quarter earnings give a clear signal that the company is willing to compromise on growth in the short term as it struggles to cut its heavy load of debt,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.
""And it's a wise thing to do considering the market is very concerned about the company’s balance-sheet risk.""
PAYING DOWN DEBT
AT&T's Latin America segment had revenue of $1.7 billion during the quarter, down from $2 billion in the year-ago quarter. AT&T said the segment lost $551 million due to foreign exchange pressures.
The carrier has focused on paying down its debt after the purchase of Time Warner. The company paid off $2.3 billion during the first quarter, and net debt now stands at $169 billion.
On Tuesday, AT&T announced it would sell office space at Hudson Yards in New York City for $2.2 billion, which it plans to use to pay down debt. 
AT&T previously received $1.43 billion by selling its stake in streaming service Hulu back to the company.
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), an AT&T rival, raised its 2019 profit forecast and beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, although it lost more phone subscribers than analysts had expected.

Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $4.1 billion, or 56 cents per share, from $4.66 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 86 cents per share, in line with estimates.

The insurer had said last week that it provided insurance for a few of the artworks and relics displayed in the cathedral, but had declined to specify the value of the contracts.
Jacques de Peretti, the chief executive of AXA's French unit, said that ""according to the information available, most of the artworks were preserved from the fire.""
AXA also provides an insurance for civil responsibility to two of the contractors who were working on Notre-Dame's restoration. De Peretti added that the insurer's maximum exposure to these contracts was ""modest"".

The French state's policy is to bear the cost of the reconstruction of historical monuments such as Notre-Dame Cathedral in the event of disasters, so neither AXA nor any other private insurer is exposed to the cost.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Caterpillar slips as higher costs dent margins at construction business,"By Rachit Vats and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) spooked investors for a second straight quarter as rising costs hit margins in its construction equipment business and tepid sales in the Asia Pacific region pointed to continuing subdued growth in China.
Shares of the company, considered a bellwether for economic activity whose results often influence global stock market sentiment, fell as much as 4 percent, overturning an initial rise due to overall results that were flattered by a tax gain.
The latest results come after the world's largest heavy duty equipment maker warned in the fourth quarter that construction activity in China could cool after two years of significant growth.
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield, however, said on Wednesday that the industry saw stronger-than-expected activity in China ahead of the Chinese New Year, though full-year sales would remain flat for Caterpillar in the region.
China accounts for up to 10 percent of the company's sales and is critical to its growth prospects as it is one of the world's largest commodities importers. Steady growth https://in.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp/chinas-first-quarter-growth-unexpectedly-steadies-but-too-early-to-call-clear-recovery-idINKCN1RT04P in China the first quarter, coming off a sharp slowdown in the previous quarter, has added to optimism that the country's economy may be starting to stabilize.
Caterpillar said sales of construction equipment in the Asia-Pacific region were flat in the first quarter, excluding the impact of currency. They fell 4 percent on a reported basis.
""Caterpillar has most exposure to China in their construction industry business and that business was just a bit disappointing on revenue and margins,"" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.
Operating margin in the construction equipment business, Caterpillar's biggest, fell to 18.5 percent from 19.7 percent a year earlier as higher manufacturing and freight costs ate into profits.
The company reported first-quarter construction revenue of $5.87 billion, missing analysts' expectation of $5.95 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Still, overall revenue rose about 5 percent to $13.5 billion and beat estimates, thanks to a 7 percent rise in sales in North America, its biggest market.
The company also raised its full-year profit forecast as it booked a gain in the first quarter related to tax reforms.
Caterpillar said it now expects 2019 profit of $12.06 per share to $13.06 per share, compared with $11.75 to $12.75 per share forecast earlier.
Excluding tax gains, the company maintained its 2019 earnings targets.
The company reported an adjusted profit of $2.94 per share in the first quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.85 a share.

Shares of the company were down 3 percent at $138 in morning trading. The stock part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was the biggest drag on the index.

226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Bourse Chief Sees Foreign Bets in Market Soaring by 2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The chief of Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange predicts ownership of equities by foreigners will triple by 2022, driven by flows from index trackers, as the country awaits the listing of its crown-jewel, Saudi Aramco.
“Since we opened up the market, we wanted to make sure we have enough companies, diversified sectors and industries,” Khalid Al Hussan, chief executive officer of the $573 billion Saudi stock exchange, said in an interview at a conference in Riyadh on Wednesday. “We are ready for the Aramco IPO, but as they change their plans, it gives more time for the exchange to develop.”
Foreigners are net buyers of about $4.3 billion in Saudi shares this year, as they anticipate the upgrade of the country within emerging-market benchmarks by MSCI Inc. and FTSE Russell. International investors will double their estimated holdings to 10 percent of the market by 2020, rising to 15 percent by 2022, Al Hussan estimates. They were initially allowed to trade shares directly in Riyadh about four years ago.
The buying spree this year contrasts with a sharp sell-off by foreigners after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October, a time when funds tied to the government stepped up purchases of equities and supported the market. Now, investors including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Man Group Plc are making clear they’re keen to invest in the biggest equities market of the Arab World.
“The more standardized the Saudi market to international norms, the easier it is for us all to trade,” Man Group CEO Luke Ellis said during a panel at the conference. He added that the quality of companies that have held initial public offerings in the nation has been “higher than in other places.”

Other IPOs
Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, may access the equity markets “sooner than you think,” Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said during the conference. The IPO, previously expected for last year and later delayed to 2021, “could slip a little bit, could come forward,” he said.
Meanwhile, there are four initial public offerings scheduled for this year, which “should be one of the best in the past five” for new deals, Al Hussan said. Saudi retailer Fawaz Alhokair Group is one of them, and the first from the kingdom to do an offering under Regulation S and Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act, which is familiar to American investors.
The tech company, Al Moammar Information Systems, raised 216 million riyals ($58 million) in an offering this year and climbed 4.9 percent on its trading debut earlier on Wednesday.

Separately, the authorities are also investigating South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), the official added. 
India's National Anti-Profiteering Authority, a quasi-judicial body set up following the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017, found P&G had not reduced its prices on many products after a cut in tax rates on those items, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
P&G told Reuters it denied the allegation.
""We have passed the net benefit and communicated the same via advertising in mass media. As a responsible corporate, P&G has always been committed to passing the net benefit of GST rate reduction to the consumers,"" it said in a statement.
Samsung said it had acted in accordance with the rules.
""Samsung reduced its sales price according to GST (Goods and Services Tax) reduction with effect from January 1, 2019. We are cooperating with DGAP (Directorate General of Anti Profiteering) on this matter,"" the company said in a statement. 
Under Indian law, companies had to pass on the benefits to customers after the government reduced the tax rate to 18 percent from 28 percent, and to 5 percent from 12 percent on many consumer durables and FMCGs (fast-moving consumer goods).
""P&G has been issued a notice to submit its reply on April 29 and explain why action should not be taken against it,"" the official, with direct knowledge of the inquiry, told Reuters.
The authority will pass a final order in the next three months, the official added.
After an initial investigation, companies are given an opportunity to defend themselves before the authority passes a final order, which can be challenged in India's higher courts.

Stocks may be overvalued, the economy might be weakening, trade tensions are everywhere -- the list goes on. And yet, here we are at a record high, contemplating where the gauge goes from here.
“The market recovery from the downturn at the end of last year is now complete,” declared Brad McMillan, the chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “With markets breaking out again, the likelihood of further gains is high, especially if earnings continue to come in ahead of expectations.”
The S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to close at a record 2,933.68 on Tuesday after the likes of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). rallied on positive earnings surprises. Futures were little changed on Wednesday at 7:30 a.m. in New York. So far this reporting season, 79 percent of companies have beaten profit estimates. That has propelled the gauge almost to the 2,950 median year-end level seen by strategists tracked by Bloomberg, meaning it has already eclipsed the expectations of many market watchers.
“FOMO,” or fear of missing out, has been the subject of discussion for weeks given the torrid pace of the equity rally that started 2019. And so far investors haven’t quite responded by jumping in en masse, but expectations continue that they will join at some point.
“Given the level of potential underinvestment by hedge fund longs, we see the possibility of a ‘catch-up’ trade in U.S. equities,” Macro Risk Advisors’ New York-based quantitative strategist Max Grinacoff wrote in an April 23 note. “Look at the rolling one-month beta of daily returns for the HFRI Global Hedge Fund Index against the S&P 500 as a proxy for level of investment -- this measure is nearly 2.5 standard deviations below the five-year mean.”
And then there are the technicals.
Citigroup Global Markets senior technical strategist Shyam Devani says the next meaningful level above 2,940, the intraday record, is the trend across the January 2018 and September 2018 highs. That comes in at 3,001.
Beyond that, “we expect gains of approximately 25 percent for the year (giving a target of around 3,132),” Singapore-based Devani said April 24.
Watching 3,000
Evercore ISI technical strategist Rich Ross’s view dovetails with Devani’s -- the S&P 500 “remains in position to trade 3,000 on the breakout” and there’s “still room here” for advancement, he said in an April 23 note.
The historical record argues that stocks could continue upward, as well.
“This marks one of the best-ever recoveries from at least a correction from an all-time high,” according to Jason Goepfert, the founder of Sundial Capital Research. He examined the S&P 500’s performance after full recoveries from losses in patterns like the current period, and found it was “pretty good,” if not “great.”
“Returns were about in line with random, and the risk/reward was about what we usually see,” Goepfert said. “The most impressive time frame was over the next year, which was consistently positive enough to suggest significance.”
While it’s been a feature of post-Financial Crisis markets to have a strong element of skepticism, even strategists who are cautious for the immediate time frame may see advances further down the road.
Chris Zaccarelli, the North Carolina-based chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance LLC, has near-term concerns. He cites a low VIX showing complacency and some technical indicators crossing into overbought levels, but says that “over the long term, this bull market should be able to sustain any pullbacks and could run for another 1-2 years.”
Even cyclical concerns are somewhat on hold for the time being, especially after the Federal Reserve pivoted to a more dovish stance, easing concerns that tighter conditions might send the economy into recession.
“While now late cycle, we view the current growth, inflation, and monetary policy environment as still supportive of risk assets,” Brian Rose of UBS’s wealth-management arm wrote in a note April 22. “In our tactical asset allocation we remain risk-on.”
“Many of the concerns that took markets down in the fourth quarter have faded,” Commonwealth’s McMillan wrote:
“With the passing of much of the worry, markets may be now free to keep moving higher,” McMillan said."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is in talks with Turkish banks and companies to buy large distressed loans following a wave of corporate restructurings in the country last year, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
The sources, who requested anonymity, did not specify the size of the restructured loans but said Goldman was looking at those valued in the range of $2 billion to $6 billion.
Turkish banks, grappling with fallout from a recession and a weak lira, could be interested in selling loans to bolster their stressed balance sheets and to gain access to liquidity, the sources said. One of the Turkish government's priorities is to relieve banks of bad loans.
One of the sources said that non-performing loans specialists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), as well as at certain large London-based banks, were in ""intense talks right now"" over restructured Turkish loans.
A representative for Goldman Sachs in Turkey declined to comment. 
Since Turkey's currency crisis last year, where the lira halved in value at one stage, companies constrained by the currency weakness have sought to restructure their debts.
The weaker lira, which has fallen another 10 percent this year, has made it difficult for Turkish companies to service foreign-currency debts. 
""They (Goldman Sachs) are not interested in complicated situations. They are interested in good loans for which the bank could provide a relative hair cut,"" or discount, a second source with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Some of the big corporate loans in Turkey that have been restructured or are being restructured include a $5.5 billion loan taken out by Yildiz Holding, which owns Godiva chocolates; a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) loan from restaurant group Dogus Holding; and a $4.75 billion loan for Turk Telekom's previous shareholder OTAS. 
Restructured loans make up more than 100 billion liras ($17 billion) of the loans in Turkey's banking sector, which total 2.5 trillion lira, Finance Ministry data showed. 
The non-performing loan ratio at banks rose to 4.2 percent in the wake of last year's crisis and is expected to reach 6 percent by year-end, according to the ministry data.
The potential for big returns from distressed debt deals has already attracted attention in the financial markets. 
Earlier this month, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it was ready to help with Turkish banks' non-performing loans. In March, sources told Reuters that Japan's Orix and U.S.-based Bain Capital were in talks to buy problematic loans from Turkish banks.
""Investment banks can talk to (Turkish) banks and take over these loans with a hair cut,"" a distressed asset trader in London said. ""But what is important here is how much of a hair cut there will be. It may take some time to be agreed upon,"" he said.
As part of a reform plan announced this month by Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, loans in the energy and construction sector would be taken off banks' balance sheets.

The Treasury will also issue 5-year debt instruments worth a total of 3.7 billion euros to strengthen the capital of state banks, it said on Monday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Japan's Softbank Group Corp will invest around 900 million euros ($1 billion) in Wirecard in a convertible bond deal that could give it a 5.6 percent stake in the German digital payments company.
The investment by the world's biggest private technology company is a vote of confidence in Wirecard's business as it defends itself against allegations of fraud, and will allow the Munich-based firm to expand its operations in Asia.
Shares in Wirecard jumped 10 percent to the top of Germany's blue-chip index by 1240 GMT.
Wirecard, founded in 1999, ousted Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) from Germany's leading share index last year as it benefited from an accelerating global trend towards digital payments driven by e-commerce.
The two companies also unveiled a strategic partnership in which Softbank will help Wirecard expand in Japan and South Korea, and provide opportunities to work with other companies in its portfolio in areas such as data analytics, AI and digital financial services.
Other Softbank investments in its Vision Fund range from ride-sharing giants including Uber (NYSE:UBER), DiDi, Grab and Ola to new financial and business services such as WeWork. Analysts said the partnership could provide further growth opportunities for Wirecard.
""Wirecard has a strong track record in pioneering innovation in digital payments and has been at the forefront in reshaping modern consumer behaviors,"" a spokesman for Softbank said.
""We are excited to partner with the company and see huge potential to deploy this technology at scale across new markets and sectors within SoftBank's global technology portfolio.""
MIXED FEELINGS
Analysts at Hauck & Aufhaueser said the partnership with an experienced tech investor would boost confidence in Wirecard's payment platform and increase the credibility of its Asian business.
Wirecard has expanded beyond deals with the banking sector and is seeking to become the go-to platform for e-commerce.
This year, it has stuck partnerships with companies including Swatch of Switzerland; Chinese travel firm Ctrip; German state railways Deutsche Bahn and German supermarket chain Real.
Other analysts questioned the rationale of the move by Softbank, which is led by Masayoshi Son.
""Wirecard may get relief today but a return to fundamentals begins tomorrow,"" said Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities. 
""We still have more questions than answers, and so we still remain sellers of the stock."" Wirecard is due to report its 2018 results on Thursday.
CONVERTIBLE BONDS
Under the agreement, Wirecard will issue bonds exclusively to an affiliate of Softbank that have an option to convert into 6.92 million Wirecard shares after five years, currently equivalent to around 5.6 percent of the company.
The conversion price of 130 euros per share represents a 5 percent premium to Wirecard's closing share price on Tuesday. Shareholders will vote on the bond issuance at its annual meeting on June 18.
Wirecard shares have shed around 38 percent since hitting a high of 199 euros in early September, hurt by negative sentiment around tech stocks and reports in the Financial Times, saying staff at its Asian operations had inflated reported revenue.
Last month, Wirecard said an outside law firm investigating the matter found local staff at its Singapore office may have committed crimes but these were not material to the German payment company's financial position.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) acted as financial advisers to SoftBank and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as legal adviser. Noerr LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP are serving as legal advisers to Wirecard.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: Securing the 5G future - what's the issue?,"(Reuters) - Britain's plan to allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies a restricted role in its next generation mobile networks is part of a heated international debate over the security risks so-called 5G technology presents.
Britain plans to allow Huawei access to non-core parts of fifth-generation, or 5G, networks on a restricted basis and block it from all so-called core parts, sources told Reuters.
The core is where the network's most critical controls are located and the most sensitive information is stored, while the periphery includes masts, antennas and other passive equipment.
The move comes despite calls from Britain's close ally, the United States, for countries to ban Huawei altogether from 5G networks because of concerns that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying or sabotage.
5G promises super-fast connections which tech evangelists say will transform the way we live our lives, enabling everything from self-driving cars to remote surgery and automated manufacturing.
But that dramatically increases the security risk, U.S. officials say, because of the increasingly central role that telecommunications will play in our lives and the expected dramatic increase in connected devices in the network.
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
As 5G becomes embedded in everything from hospitals to transport systems and power plants it will rapidly become a part of each country's critical national infrastructure.
This makes the consequences of the networks failing or being deliberately sabotaged in a cyber attack significantly more serious.
""5G will really start touching all parts of our lives because it will be the underlying infrastructure for so much of the critical services that are provided to the public,"" said Robert Strayer, the U.S. State Department's lead cyber policy diplomat.
""So if a 5G network fails, there would be significant ramifications for all parts of society,"" Strayer said. 
MORE CONNECTIONS
With much faster data speeds, experts predict there will be billions of connected devices.
These will include traditional mobile and broadband connections, but also internet-enabled devices from dishwashers through to advanced medical equipment. Industry association GSMA forecasts the number of internet-enabled devices will triple to 25 billion by 2025.
The larger the network, the more opportunities there are for hackers to attack, meaning there is an increasingly complex system with more parts that need protecting.
DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM
One of the biggest changes between 4G and 5G is the ability to take the advanced computing power usually kept in the protected ""core"" of a network and distribute it to other parts of the system. This will provide more reliable high-speed connections.
But it also means engineers will no longer be able to clearly ring-fence the most sensitive parts of the system, U.S. officials say.
Some British lawmakers agree.
""Allowing Huawei into the UK's 5G infrastructure would cause allies to doubt our ability to keep data secure and erode the trust essential to Five Eyes cooperation,"" said Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of Britain's Foreign Affairs Committee.
The Five Eyes alliance is an intelligence sharing group that comprises the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

""The definition of core and non-core is a very difficult one with 5G,"" he added.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>","European shares hit highest since August on Credit Suisse, SAP","By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares pared back losses on Wednesday as positive earnings in Europe from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and investor support for SAP helped soothe worries that China has put broader stimulus on hold.
European shares crept into positive territory, with the pan-regional STOXX 600 index edging up 0.1 percent to reach its highest level since Aug. 1. Germany's DAX shrugged off a business survey showing German business morale deteriorated in April, to rise 0.8 percent.
""The big picture is the tussle between Asia, which has pulled back, and America, where the markets made new highs, so Europe is probably going to be a bit torn between the two,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""The positive for Europe is Credit Suisse's earnings, which could reignite upbeat sentiment and show that some financials are doing well despite weak European economic sentiment and the problems from very low interest rates,” he added. 
Credit Suisse's shares rose 2.7 percent after the bank posted an unexpected rise in earnings and said it was cautiously optimistic about the second quarter following a challenging start to the year. 
It posted a net profit of 749 million Swiss francs ($734 million) for the first quarter of 2019 as larger-than-expected wealth management gains offset investment banking declines. 
Results from UBS Group AG and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) follow on Thursday and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Friday.
Top performers on the STOXX 600 were payments company Wirecard and business software company SAP, which also boosted the DAX.
Wirecard jumped 8 percent after Bloomberg reported that Japan's SoftBank was looking to invest about 900 million euros ($1 billion) for a minority stake in the company.
SAP climbed 9.0 percent, putting it on target for its best day since November 2008, as U.S. activist investor Elliott revealed a 1.2 billion euro stake in SAP and said it supported a new management efficiency drive. That followed the company setting new medium-term profit targets after reporting a first-quarter operating loss that chiefly resulted from a restructuring charge.
Wall Street was looking set for a subdued start after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes reached record closing highs overnight. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose 0.8 percent in premarket before its results on Wednesday as investors awaited details on the impact of the 737 MAX jet groundings on the planemaker’s earnings.
In Asia, the biggest regional loser was South Korea's KOSPI, which fell 0.9 percent, with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) down 1 percent.
Investors shrugged off the government's proposed supplementary budget aimed in part at supporting exports from the country and focused instead on a warning from chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which said it expects a slowdown in demand for microchips to last a few more quarters.
Chinese equities flitted between gains and losses as investors debated whether Beijing would slow its pace of policy easing following stronger-than-expected first-quarter economic growth.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was broadly flat, down 0.03 percent in early afternoon European trade.
SRI LANKA
Sri Lanka's main stock index traded at its lowest since December 2012 following the deadly Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 350 people. Analysts have said the country's economy might need IMF assistance to overcome the devastation from the incident.
The Turkish lira hit its weakest intraday level against the dollar since mid-October as investors worried about risks generated by challenges to Istanbul election results and strains in relations with the United States.
Market attention is also focused on the Turkish central bank's rate-setting meeting on Thursday, when it is expected to keep its policy rate unchanged at 24 percent. 
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, remained close to a 22-month high, following strong U.S. housing data. It stood at 97.620 after rising to 97.777 overnight, its highest since June 2017.
The Aussie dollar was the biggest mover among the main currencies, falling to a 1-1/2 month low of $0.7027.
After jumping to 2019 highs earlier this week, oil prices eased on Wednesday on signs that global markets remain adequately supplied.
Brent traded down 0.34 percent at $74.26 per barrel, while U.S. crude dipped 0.39 to $66.04 a barrel.
Gold prices were up 0.1 percent to $1,270.60 per ounce, up from the previous session's four-month low.

Shares of the Indiana-based company rose 2.7 percent to $257.39 before the opening bell.
Last year, the health insurance sector experienced its biggest shake up in years, as rivals Aetna (NYSE:AET) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) closed deals with the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers. 
Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, also overhauled its pharmacy benefits business after years of relying on Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) to handle those operations. Its new company, IngenioRx, is expected to be launched during the second quarter with the help of CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS).
For 2019, Anthem said it expects adjusted earnings to be above $19.20 per share, higher than its prior estimate of more than $19.00.
Members in the company's health plans rose by 1.2 million to 40.8 million, helped by growth in the government business that provides Medicare health plans for people aged 65 and older and Medicaid plans for the poor.
The company gained market share across its commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses and its earnings forecast for the year beat the average Wall Street estimate of $19.17, implying consensus estimates will move higher, Stephens Inc analyst Scott Fidel said.
Anthem's benefit expense ratio — the percentage of premiums taken in that are paid out for medical services — worsened to 84.4 percent in the quarter from 81.5 percent a year earlier, partly due to a one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2019. Analysts on average had expected 84 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said certain states in which it runs Medicaid plans saw higher medical costs.
Net income rose 18.2 percent to $1.55 billion, or $5.91 per share, in the quarter ended March 31.
Excluding items, the company earned $6.03 per share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $5.81.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Behind Airbnb's bet on show business to hook travelers,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hollywood has a new suitor in Silicon Valley.
Airbnb Inc, the high-flying startup for booking home rentals around the world, has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers' appetite for travel, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The strategy, previously unreported, is crucial for the company, which is privately valued at $31 billion and is gearing up for an initial public offering of stock expected next year. Airbnb must distinguish itself from Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) and others in the fiercely competitive and consolidating travel industry, where apartment-renting services are increasingly common.
Chief Executive Brian Chesky is driving the idea, three of the people said, arguing that creative content is important for Airbnb's brand even if the business case is not always clear.
""Brian wants to create a studio,"" one of the people said. The mentality: ""Let's do shows. Let's do films, because we want to be travel-everything.""
Chesky, who co-founded the company, ""likes big splashy things,"" another person said.
For at least three years, Airbnb has batted around ideas for creating or licensing mini-series and documentaries about travel, and shows featuring Airbnb homes, guests and hosts, one of the people said. It has discussed working with studios as well as starting its own.
(GRAPHIC: Airbnb in the spotlight - https://tmsnrt.rs/2IkarwX)
The company has worked on a television show slated for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's upcoming streaming service: ""Home,"" a docuseries featuring unique abodes around the world and the people behind them. One executive producer of the show is Joe Poulin, a company vice president who ran Luxury Retreats when Airbnb acquired the booking site in 2017.
Airbnb announced last week it had developed and produced the documentary ""Gay Chorus Deep South,"" which follows the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus on a tour across the Southeastern United States, and will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival next week. Airbnb told Reuters it provided funding for the project.
In an interview, Airbnb's top policy and communications executive, Chris Lehane, said the company is considering streaming films and shows through its app as well as through other video platforms.
""We're very much in the R&D phase here,"" said Lehane. ""It's not just limited to video. It could be audible. It could be physical.""
""The more we put content out there, the more you're going to bring people to the platform,"" he said.
Original shows could also entice customers even before they have decided where to go on vacation and demystify Airbnb for travelers, including Wall Street investors, who have stuck to familiar hotel chains.
(Graphic on how Airbnb stacks up against its venture-backed peers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2IkarwX)
TECH INDUSTRY PLAYBOOK
Airbnb has yet to cement all the details related to its timeline, program financing or even lineup. Its work so far has ranged from the Tribeca documentary to a YouTube show about travel trends and other video marketing efforts.
Offering original content and other media is an increasingly popular strategy in Silicon Valley, where technology companies are desperate for deeper relationships with internet users and their lucrative data.
Apple last month unveiled a TV streaming service and joined a long list of companies attracted to Hollywood's glitter, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. The big-box retailer had said it will partner with U.S. movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to make content for its video-on-demand service, Vudu.
Such bets are expensive, but often justified by executives for their marketing value. Airbnb said its network of half a billion travelers is drawing partners who wish to produce and finance content for the company.
Airbnb's original magazine remains central to this effort. Published by media conglomerate Hearst since May 2017, the Airbnb Magazine will be a jumping off point for other content that the company develops. It is the darling of CEO Chesky, something the billionaire founder hopes will become a collector's item like old print editions of ""Rolling Stone,"" Lehane said.
Films and streaming content would mark the next iteration of a business that has steadily expanded to get customers to use its app for more parts of their travel experience. Airbnb added restaurant reservations and said it would branch into transportation services, so customers remain in its orbit long after they have picked a place to stay.
The company even explored building its own flight-booking feature and acquiring travel fare aggregator Skyscanner before retreating from that idea, said another person with knowledge of the matter.
A key player in the video effort is Kim Kingsley, co-founder of news site Politico. Kingsley joined Airbnb last summer and is in charge of the firm's content strategy, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. Meanwhile, Airbnb's magazine lead, Ben Kasman, has helped grow the publication to more than a million readers.
Even by technology startups' standards, Airbnb is not afraid to spend large sums on marketing. It hired Ready State, a high-end agency in San Francisco, whose employees flew to Europe to create videos for Airbnb. The firm was also hired to promote tours sold on Airbnb's website, known as ""Experiences,"" even though many of those are cheap.

""It's all part of the efforts to broaden the base,"" said one person close to the company, ""to make what they do more mainstream.""

248,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>","Adding to Ghosn woes, Nissan slashes profit outlook to near-decade low","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co slashed its full-year profit forecast to its lowest in nearly a decade due to weakness in the United States, just as it adjusts to life without Carlos Ghosn and charts its future with alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
The Japanese automaker expects operating profit for the year ended March to drop 45 percent versus a year earlier to 318 billion yen ($2.84 billion), from a previous forecast for 450 billion yen, on expenses related to extending vehicle warranties in the United States, its biggest market.
Nissan also blamed the arrest of former Chairman Ghosn for tarnishing its brand and contributing to the decline in profit to the lowest since the year ended March 2010.
This is the second cut to the automaker's operating profit forecast in two months, and adds pressure on Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa just as he works to draw a line under Ghosn's legacy by overhauling corporate governance and seeking a more equal footing with Renault, Nissan's biggest shareholder.
At its full-year results on May 14, the automaker will book a 66 billion yen provision for costs related to extending the warranty on its continuously variable transmission system installed in about 3 million Sentra and Altima sedans and Versa subcompact models between 2012 and 2017 for the U.S. market.
Following complaints that the key powertrain component made excessive noise and vibrations with age, the automaker said it decided this week to extend their warranty to seven years from five in hopes of building brand loyalty in a market where it has been struggling for the past three years. 
Falling profit has been a headache for Nissan since before Ghosn was first arrested in November on allegations of financial misconduct. Currently in jail after his fourth arrest, Ghosn, who denies wrongdoing, could learn as early as Wednesday whether he will be released on bail for a second time.
The once-feted executive has repeatedly accused Nissan executives of mismanagement since his ouster, which he has characterized as a boardroom coup. Now the automaker is saying that Ghosn's arrest has hurt business. 
""Everyday, there are many reports of the case,"" Nissan CFO Hiroshi Karube said on Wednesday, referring to the scandal.
""Non-Nissan users are hesitant to buy our cars."" 
U.S. WOES
The biggest blow, however, to Nissan's bottom line has come from the costly sales incentives in the United States. 
For years it has relied on heavy discounting in its biggest market to sell its Rogue compact sport utility vehicles and Altima sedans to expand market share, under aggressive targets Ghosn set during his time as chief executive.
Saikawa, who took over as CEO in 2017, has pledged to focus on improving profit margins, but it has been a slow process as Nissan continues to resort to discounting to shore up sales. 
""Sales volumes were lower than expected, so we were unable to realize our cost-reduction plans,"" CFO Karube said, adding that overall dismal U.S. performance will wipe 43 billion yen from Nissan's bottom line in the year ended March.
""We didn't make as much progress on volumes and improvements to incentives as planned,"" he added.
Analysts warned that Nissan's troubles could weaken its footing with partner Renault, which has been pushing for a closer merger, but which many at Nissan have opposed. 
""To maintain its stance against closer ties with Renault, Nissan must improve its financial performance so it can hold its position,"" said Satoru Takada, managing director at securities research company TIW. 
Nissan shares closed down 4 percent after the profit warning, while Renault shares shed as much as 5.5 percent.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse lifts profit with surprise equity trading gains,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) set a positive tone for this quarter's European bank results on Wednesday, lifting its net profit as gains in equities and deeper ties between trading and private banking helped offset lower revenue.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank bucked market expectations of a profit dip and said it gained market share in equities trading during a quarter in which major U.S. rivals such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) saw revenue slides in this business.
Its Global Markets trading unit, the focus of much criticism in recent years, increased equity trading, with Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam saying Credit Suisse was ""moving up the ranks in equities"". But a slide in its Asian unit brought overall group revenue from equities sales and trading down by 5 percent.
Wednesday's results also included a forecast that Credit Suisse was cautiously optimistic about the second quarter.
Although Credit Suisse last year wrapped up a three-year overhaul with its first annual profit since 2014, volatile earnings and high headcount in its trading division meant it faced questions over whether it was downsized enough.
""Global Markets has been the main cause of consensus earnings downgrades over the past year and with these results has now shown signs of stabilizing,"" Citi analysts said.
However, in the first quarter Credit Suisse said the unit increased equity sales and trading by 4 percent, while fixed-income sales and trading fell by just 2 percent, notably less than at U.S. investment banks.
Credit Suisse shares rose by more than 3 percent to a six-month high following the results, in which it confirmed its full-year profitability target but noted it would need supportive markets, and a pickup in revenues, to hit its goals.
Last month Swiss rival UBS forecast first-quarter revenues would fall by about a third in its investment bank and by 9 percent in wealth management, its largest business. 
UBS is looking to cut costs further as CEO Sergio Ermotti sounded a pessimistic note on profitability for the year. 
Analysts expect first-quarter profit at UBS, which is Switzerland's biggest bank, to have nearly halved when it reports on Thursday.

(Reuters) - European shares edged lower on Wednesday as signals that China has put broader stimulus on hold overshadowed strong earnings from the likes of SAP and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0920 GMT - though the benchmark index has notched gains in the past eight consecutive sessions, and shown a tendency to rebound from a weaker open.
""The market is taking some cue from the slowing of stimulus in China,"" said Stefan Koopman, Market Economist, Eurozone, Rabobank. 
""For the European markets to get some traction in the upcoming months we really need to depend on what's happening in China.""
Most major regional bourses were in the red though the slew of upbeat earnings helping German and Swiss indexes advance.
Business software company SAP soared to an all-time high and boosted the DAX after the company set ambitious new mid-term targets and as activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a 1.2 billion euro ($1.35 billion) stake in the company.
Top performer was Wirecard which climbed 8 percent after the payments company confirmed Japan's Softbank Group Corp will buy a 5.6 percent stake in the firm.
STMicro shrugged off a gloomy prediction by bigger rival Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and posted a broadly inline update, which sent its shares up more than 3 percent. 
SAP and STMicro drove the tech sector up 2.5 percent to its highest since July 2018.
Kicking off the first-quarter balance sheet assessment for banks in the region, Swiss lender Credit Suisse rose 2.5 percent after posting a surprise profit and saying it was cautiously optimistic about the second-quarter following a challenging start to the year.
Results from Credit Suisse will be followed by UBS Group AG and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Thursday and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Friday.
Healthcare stocks got a boost from Novartis' gains as the Swiss drugmaker raised its 2019 guidance after a first-quarter earnings and sales beat.
Swedish truckmaker AB Volvo rose after reporting a better-than-expected first-quarter operating profit on the back of stronger pricing and easing supply chain constraints. 
Auto stocks dropped 0.7 percent, led by  Renault  (PA:RENA) after its Japanese partner Nissan Motor Co slashed its full-year profit forecast to its lowest in nearly a decade due to weakness in the United States.

254,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 04:59AM ET</span>","StockBeat - Elliott Effect Lifts SAP, as Softbank Bets on Wirecard","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The Elliott Effect just hit SAP (DE:SAPG).
The B2B software provider is at the top of the Dax and the Euro Stoxx 50 after early trading on Wednesday, after Paul Singer’s Elliott Management disclosed it has accumulated a $1.3 billion stake in the company via stock and derivatives.
Normally, that could have set Germany’s most valuable company up for a potentially bruising battle with one of Wall Street’s most aggressive activist investors. However, SAP appears to have pre-empted a head-on clash by announcing new targets for profit margins and stock repurchases. They’re designed to reassure investors who have been unsettled by recent high-profile departures and by uncertain progress in migrating its core software business to a cloud-based subscription model.
The new targets more than made up for a quarterly loss caused by restructuring charges and other items related to SAP's expensive-looking $8 billion acquisition of Qualtrics last year. Underlying earnings rose by more than expected, while operating margins from its cloud-based business also improved.
Elliott said it agrees with the strategy, according to newswire reports.
The shares rose as much as 7% to a new all-time high in early trading and were up 6.6% as of 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).
SAP was one of two reasons Germany’s DAX was alone in staying in the green early Wednesday, on a day when profit-taking kicked in across Asian and European markets after Wall Street hit new record highs on Tuesday. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.46 points, or 0.1%, at 390.90.
The other reason for the Dax’s outperformance was payments processor Wirecard (DE:WDIG), which rose over 7% after Japan’s venture capital giant Softbank announced a $1 billion investment. That’s a huge vote of confidence in a company that has been plagued by allegations of false accounting – allegations that it has repeatedly denied.
Quarterly reports from across Europe have also included some other positive surprises:  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) rose 2.6% after reporting an 8% increase in net profit in the quarter, while chipmaker STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) rose 3.1% after beating expectations. Pharma giant  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) also rose 2.7% as it raised its full-year guidance for core operating profit after a strong first quarter. U.K. fast-fashion group boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) also rose 3.8% after announcing a sharp rise in full-year sales and improved profit margins."
255,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>","Samsung plans $116 billion investment in non-memory chips to challenge TSMC, Qualcomm","SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd plans to invest $116 billion in non-memory chips through 2030, to cut its reliance on the volatile memory chip market and develop chips to power self-driving cars and AI-enabled devices.
The plan underscores the South Korean firm's ambition to challenge bigger rivals - Taiwan's TSMC in contract chip manufacturing and San Diego-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc in mobile processing chips - as the memory chip market contracts sharply after years of an unprecedented boom.
Global semiconductor makers are in a race to produce powerful chips to support new technologies such as fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, connected cars and artificial intelligence (AI).
In March, U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp agreed to buy Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for $6.8 billion, beating rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) in a deal that would help Nvidia boost its data center and AI businesses.
Samsung, which has expanded its chip business largely through organic investment, said on Wednesday its 133 trillion won ($116 billion) spending will comprise of 73 trillion won for domestic R&D and 60 trillion won for production infrastructure.
""The investment plan is expected to help the company to reach its goal of becoming the world leader in not only memory semiconductors but also logic chips by 2030,"" it said in a statement.
Although Samsung does not disclose the breakdown of its investment in the semiconductor division, analysts said more than half of its total capital expenditure usually goes to memory chips.
In 2018, Samsung spent 29.4 trillion won in capital expenditure and four-fifths of the budget went to the semiconductor division where memory chips generated 96 percent of the operation's profit.
""Samsung appears to be aggressive on the non-memory side given the size of the spending, but it is too early to tell whether this long-term plan will work out because it depends a lot on the demand situation and market conditions,"" said senior analyst Song Myung-sup at HI Investment & Securities.
The aggressive investment plan in semiconductors also comes as Samsung's smartphone business, once its biggest earnings generator, struggles to revive growth.
The world's top smartphone maker decided this week to delay the launch of its widely anticipated foldable phone after several reviewers discovered problems with the display.
MORE JOBS
Samsung said the chip investment will create 15,000 jobs.
The firm's heir apparent Jay Y. Lee, awaiting a Supreme Court decision on his bribery conviction, has been under pressure from the government to help create more jobs, as Asia's fourth-largest economy is battling rising numbers of jobless college graduates partly due to slowing economic growth.
South Korea, the world's biggest producer of memory chips thanks to Samsung and domestic rival SK Hynix Inc, also wants to reduce its reliance on memory chip sales to smoothen volatile export trends.
The government is preparing its own support program for the non-memory chip sector, an official at the industry ministry told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday, without giving further details. Local media have reported that the government announcement could come later this month.
""It is hard to figure out what Samsung really wants to focus on in terms of products, but I suspect it can be a foundry, or chips related to cameras or displays,"" said Kim Sun-woo, an analyst at Meritz Securities. 
With a 19 percent market share, Samsung is a distant second player in the foundry - or contract chip manufacturing - sector, trailing market champion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), according to industry tracker TrendForce.
Samsung also produces processor chips for mobile phones in a market dominated by the likes of Qualcomm and Intel.
Shares in Samsung closed down 1 percent on Wednesday, broadly in line with the wider market's 0.9 percent fall.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission agreed with Goldman Sachs under guidelines that allow it to negotiate a settlement rather than to simply issue a fine. The deal relates to how Goldman Sachs’s Asia unit worked with Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co., the majority owner of the onshore joint venture, on its trading business. Employees at both firms have agreed to step up internal controls, the CSRC said in a statement late Tuesday.
The settlement underscores Chinese regulators’ willingness to use new approaches to supervision as they increase scrutiny of financial markets. Fines and confiscations levied by the CSRC reached a record $1.59 billion last year, according to official data.
“This case represents a major breakthrough in the history of China’s securities regulatory and administrative law enforcement,” said Melody Yang, a Beijing-based partner at Simmons & Simmons. “We expect this approach will be more widely accepted by the market.”
A total of nine parties, including Goldman Sachs and Beijing Gao Hua, will pay 150 million yuan ($22 million) to settle the case, according to the CSRC notice. It didn’t identify the rest.
“We are pleased to have resolved the matter,” a spokeswoman who represents Goldman Sachs and Beijing Gao Hua said.
Between October 2013 and July 2015, traders at Goldman Sachs’s Asian unit used its account held with Beijing Gao Hua to carry out trades and provided “business guidance” to staff at Beijing Gao Hua, according to the CSRC notice.
“The two parties engaged in other related stock and stock index futures contract transactions during four trading days from May to July 2015,” the notice said. During those three months, the Shanghai Composite Index slumped 18 percent as turmoil gripped Chinese markets.
Goldman Sachs owns 33 percent of Beijing-based Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., with the remainder held by Beijing Gao Hua.
(Updates with background in final paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to clarify the case involved Beijing Gao Hua Securities, not the local joint venture.)

The e-commerce giant widened its lead over Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). in Asia’s cloud computing market in 2018, according to Gartner, which in turn helped it narrow its global gap with those two rivals. That’s helping Alibaba advance billionaire co-founder Jack Ma’s vision of earning half its revenue beyond China.
Alibaba’s overseas cloud expansion will continue to outpace its domestic growth as the company pushes further into other countries, according to Lancelot Guo, Alibaba Cloud’s vice president and head of strategy. “Internationalization is a key strategy for Alibaba and cloud,” Guo said in a phone interview. “We want to grow even faster.”
The company declined to disclose its budget or revenue target. Guo said it seeks to cater to U.S. companies investing in China and vice versa, and that setting up data centers in Indonesia and Malaysia will help it comply with local data requirements.
The cloud business underpins Alibaba’s revenue growth, helping it offset saturation in its home e-commerce arena. The overall cloud market could grow by 55 percent to $331.2 billion in three years, according to Gartner, and Alibaba’s cloud business has been generating triple-digit revenue growth over the past three years, outpacing the industry.
Gartner estimates that Alibaba last year accounted for 19.6 percent of the Asia region’s markets for infrastructure as a service and infrastructure utility services, two of the most popular forms of cloud business. That means its regional market share rose by nearly a third from 2017, while Amazon’s fell slightly to 11 percent. (Globally, Amazon leads with 30.4 percent to Alibaba’s 4.9 percent.)
It’s been a tumultuous year for global tech operators as the U.S., Europe and countries across Southeast Asia tighten their grip on data services. Vietnam and Thailand are among the nations warming to a stricter model of governance than tech companies have been accustomed to in the internet era.
That’s one reason to invest in local data centers. Alibaba has 15 such facilities in Asia excluding China, including Hong Kong, Australia, India and Japan. “We are very, very sensitive and aware,” said Guo. “We work with a lot of third parties to understand each country’s laws.”"

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Wednesday granted a new banking license to technology-driven business lender Judo Bank, the lender and the country's financial regulator said, to improve competition in a sector dominated by four big banks.
The license allows Judo to compete against larger banks for deposits and use the funds to lend to small businesses, Judo Bank Co-Chief Executive Officer Joseph Healy said.
""The fundamental difference for Judo, is that we will be able to access the deposit market.""
As an authorized deposit-taking institution, Judo customer's deposits are subject to the same A$250,000 government guarantee that protects deposits at the larger banks, Healy said.
The license allows Judo to operate without restrictions, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said in an emailed statement.
Australia's deposit and lending market is overwhelmingly dominated by four large lenders — Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank.
Research by the country's top economic adviser has shown the market dominance of the Big Four lenders has been detrimental to customers, prompting the government to call for more banks to challenge the industry's oligopoly.
A misconduct inquiry on Australia's financial sector exposed instances of cash bribes paid to win mortgage business and fees charged to the accounts of dead customers.
""The reason why we built Judo was that we strongly believed that the banking market was not providing the service that small and medium size businesses were looking for,"" Healy said.
""So we decided to build a new bank that would go back to banking as it should be, by providing a human service as well as a technology platform.""
Following criticism for failing to stimulate competition in the country's finance sector, APRA last year granted its first license to an internet-only banking startup, Volt Bank.
Unlike Volt, Judo provides online-only services for depositors, but also uses relationship bankers to service the small and medium businesses it lends to.

LONDON (Reuters) - British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) said on Wednesday that Andy Briggs, head of its UK insurance business, was stepping down from the company, just weeks after missing out on its top job to newly installed Chief Executive Maurice Tulloch.
Briggs will remain with the insurer until Oct. 23 to support an orderly transition, Aviva said in a statement.
He joined the Board of Aviva in April 2015 to lead its enlarged UK Life business following the takeover of Friends Life where he served as Group Chief Executive.
The company said Briggs would be granted 'good leaver' status and therefore be eligible both for a pro-rated bonus in respect of the 2019 financial year and to retain awards applicable under its Long-Term Incentive Plan, due to vest in March 2020, March 2021 and March 2022.
Angela Darlington, currently Aviva's Group Chief Risk Officer, will become interim chief executive of UK Insurance, subject to regulatory approval.
Aviva also said Tulloch would lead a review of the UK businesses to ensure ""the appropriate management structure"" going forward.
Separately, Aviva said it would broaden its senior leadership team with the appointment of Colm Holmes, CEO of Aviva Canada and Global Corporate & Speciality, and Patrick Dixneuf, who becomes CEO of Aviva's European businesses.

As a result of the changes, Aviva will not seek to appoint a new CEO International, the role vacated by Tulloch before he became Group CEO.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most prominent retail shareholder group said on Wednesday it will vote against AMP Ltd's executive pay proposals for a second straight year, adding to pressure on the board of the country's largest listed wealth manager.
Under Australian corporate rules, if more than a quarter of shareholders vote against pay proposals two years running, they can call for the board to be removed.
AMP investors last year voted overwhelmingly against its executive pay plans in the wake of damaging revelations of board-level misconduct, setting the firm up for a possible board shake-up if a significant protest vote is repeated this year.
However, large institutional investors and governance advisers have flagged they intend to support the company's resolutions at its annual general meeting on May 2, given that a board ouster would only add to the instability of the company.
Still, the announcement by the Australian Shareholder's Association (ASA) about the protest vote at the AGM comes at an unwelcome time for AMP, which is trying to rebuild its brand following serious revelations of misconduct at a sector inquiry.
The wealth manager will face disgruntled shareholders at the AGM where they will also vote on the election of Chairman David Murray, who has been criticized over the sale price of the company's life insurance arm.
""ASA remains concerned about governance and culture at AMP,"" the non-profit group said in an emailed statement. 
The shareholder group said there was insufficient detail about the key performance indicators and targets set for executives and highlighted it had paid an ""excessive sign-on benefit"" to its new CEO, with no conditions other than remaining employed. 
""The failure to seek shareholder approval of the sale of the life business also provided little comfort,"" it said.
A spokeswoman for AMP did not respond to requests for comment. 
The 170-year-old company has been embroiled in accusations of deception at a government-mandated inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector. 
The company subsequently lost its chairman and chief executive officer, hemorrhaged billions of dollars in funds and is defending itself against class action lawsuits.
In an attempt to avoid a potential ouster of its board, the Sydney-based firm said in March it would slash short-term bonuses for most executives.

Last year, it hired Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), a veteran  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) banker, as CEO and agreed to pay him A$17.7 million, on top of his salary.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 01:28AM ET</span>","Hyundai Motor profit jumps as South Korea, U.S. sales offset China slump","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor reported a better-than-expected 24 percent jump in net profit for the January-to-March quarter, as improved business at home and the United States helped offset weaker sales in China.
The rise in profit, from an eight-year low hit a year ago, comes after Hyundai recently flagged plans to suspend production at its oldest plant in China as it grapples with massive overcapacity in its biggest market.
Hyundai posted a first-quarter net profit of 829 billion won ($721.81 million), versus 668 billion won a year earlier. This was above an average estimate of 758 billion profit from 15 analysts, according to I/B/E/S Refinitiv data. 
Its operating profit rose 21 percent to 825 billion won, while its revenue was up 7 percent to 23.99 trillion won. 
Its first-quarter sales in China slumped 19 percent to its lowest since the global economic downturn in 2009, dragged by the lack of attractive models and strong branding amid growing competition from local and global rivals. 
An overall slowdown in auto sales in China in the first quarter after contracting in 2018 for the first time in almost three decades weighed further on Hyundai's sales in the country, home to the world's biggest car market.
In contrast, Hyundai's sales in South Korea rose 9 percent to its highest since 2002 in the first quarter, with its new Palisade large SUV selling better than expected, even as its rivals from General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to Mercedes Benz and BMW struggled with falling sales. 
U.S. SALES
In the United States, the world's second-largest car market where Hyundai is slowly catching up with the shift to sport utility vehicles, the automaker's sales rose 2 percent.
Just last week, Hyundai hired former Nissan executive Jose Munoz to oversee its Americas operation, replacing William Lee, who has held the position for less than a year. 
The appointment comes at a time when Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors, together the world's the fifth-biggest automaker, are facing regulatory investigations in the United States into the timeliness of recalls involving defective engines and thousands of fires connected to their vehicles.
A threat of import tariffs has further blurred the outlook for their U.S. sales. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to levy tariffs of some 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts on national security grounds, has until about May 17 to act on any tariff recommendations made by the Commerce Department. 
South Korean government officials said the country could be exempt from the tariffs as Seoul has made concessions in autos under a revised trade deal with Washington. 
But Hyundai CEO Ha Eon-tae cautioned union leaders earlier this month that tariffs, if imposed, could wipe off two of the automaker's South Korean factories, according to a union newsletter on its website.
Hyundai has one factory in the United States and around half of its vehicles sold in the United States comes mainly from South Korea and Mexico. 

Hyundai shares rose 1.5 percent after the results, outperforming the wider market's 1.3 percent fall.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Didi Mobility Japan, a joint venture (JV) by China's Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Corp, said it would expand its taxi-hailing service to 13 cities across Japan. 
The app was first rolled out in September in Osaka, a popular destination for Chinese tourists, where it has tied up with 40 taxi firms in an increasingly crowded market for such apps that includes rivals backed by Sony Corp (T:6758) and Toyota Motor Corp. 
It is expanding into Tokyo and Kyoto from Wednesday, with a further 10 locations to follow in the current financial year.
Despite SoftBank's oversized presence in the global ride-hailing industry, such services are effectively banned in Japan, leaving SoftBank portfolio companies like Didi and Uber (NYSE:UBER) limited to offering services that match taxis with customers.
Didi is among a growing number of SoftBank Group Corp-backed companies launching JVs with SoftBank's domestic telco. Other startups doing so are shared co-working firm WeWork Cos and Indian hotel startup OYO. 

As part of SoftBank's efforts to drive synergies between its portfolio companies users will be able to access the taxi-hailing service through Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan's route-finding app and pay via PayPay, an app that uses tech from India's Paytm.

The company, striving to improve margins and post a profit later this year, has laid off workers including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs.
Tesla has since said it will keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models.
The upgrades include a new drivetrain design and a new adaptive suspension system, increasing each vehicle's driving range, the company said in a blog post https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther ahead of its first-quarter results on Wednesday.
With the upgrades, the long-range version of Model S and X can now travel 370 miles (595.5 km) and 325 miles, respectively, on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cycle.
The lower-priced options, or the 'standard range' versions, of Model X and Model S were available for purchase on Tesla's website after Tuesday's announcement for $83,000 and $78,000, respectively. Estimated delivery of both cars was set for May.
Earlier in April, Tesla reported fewer-than-expected vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, with figures for the Model S sedans and Model X SUVs more-than-halving compared with the preceding quarter.

The Silicon Valley carmaker has faced a range of challenges over the past year as one of the leaders in electric vehicle technology sought to ramp up production, deliveries and sales of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability.

The Aussie dropped as much as 0.9 percent, the most in a month, to 70.36 U.S. cents. Yields on the three-year bond slid 14 basis points to a record 1.29 percent. Australia’s stock benchmark extended its gain, rising as much as 1.1 percent to it highest in more than 11 years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former engineer and a Chinese businessman have been charged with economic espionage and conspiring to steal trade secrets from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co to benefit China, according to an indictment unsealed by the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday. 
The indictment against the former GE engineer, Xiaoqing Zheng, and Chinese businessman Zhaoxi Zhang, comes after Zheng was initially charged in August in connection with the alleged theft. It marks the first time the U.S. government has formally said the scheme was carried out to benefit China and that the Chinese government provided ""financial and other support.""
According to the indictment, Zheng stole the proprietary data on GE's turbine technology by encrypting the files on his computer and secretly embedding them into a digital photograph of sunset before emailing the photograph to his personal email.
Zheng, 56, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday and was allowed to remain free on bond. His attorney Kevin Luibrand declined to comment.
The charges are the latest in a handful of cases brought by the Justice Department since last year as part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration, which has vowed to fight Chinese theft of corporate secrets, cheating through intellectual property theft, illegal corporate subsidies and the use of rules that hamper U.S. corporations that want to sell their goods in China.
The FBI has said in the past that nearly every one of the agency’s 56 field offices have investigations into economic espionage tied to China.
The 14-count indictment against the pair charges that Zheng, who worked at GE Power & Water in Schenectady, New York, stole multiple electronic files containing details about design models, engineering drawings and other specifications related to the company's gas and steam turbines.
Prosecutors say he emailed the files to Zhang, who was located in China.
GE said in a statement it has ""been in close cooperation with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for some time on this matter.""
The two men allegedly used the stolen information to advance their own business interests in two turbine research and development companies - Liaoning Tianyi Aviation Technology Co Ltd and Nanjing Tianyi Avi Tech Co Ltd. 
The indictment adds that the pair received financial and other support from the Chinese government through those two companies, and they coordinated with Chinese government officials.
According to the indictment, Zheng told GE in February 2016 that he was operating an aviation parts supply company in China with his brothers, and asked permission to ensure it did not violate any rules about conflicts of interest. GE approved his proposal, asking that he protect the company's intellectual property. 
About a year later, around November or December 2017, GE discovered a large number of encrypted files saved on Zheng's computer.
By July 2018, the company learned he had embedded the files in the seemingly innocuous photo of a sunset and emailed them to himself. 
In interviews with the FBI in August 2018, prosecutors said he admitted to taking GE files. He also told agents his companies in China had received grant money from the Chinese government.

Zheng and Zhang, 46, were formally indicted on April 18. A jury trial has been set for June 24 in Albany, New York. Zhang was believed to be in China, the Justice Department said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Tuesday and spent a significant time questioning him about why he had lost some Twitter followers, a person briefed on the matter said.
The meeting, which was organized by the White House last week, came hours after Trump again attacked the social media company over his allegations it is biased against conservatives.
""Great meeting this afternoon at the @WhiteHouse with @Jack from @Twitter. Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general. Look forward to keeping an open dialogue!"" Trump tweeted, posting a photo of Dorsey and others with him in the Oval Office.
Dorsey, who had not previously met with Trump, replied in a tweet: ""Thank you for the time. Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil. Thanks for the discussion about that.""
The source, who was briefed on the meeting that included Twitter’s general counsel and public policy chief, said Dorsey explained in response to Trump’s concerns about losing followers that the company was working to remove fraudulent and spam accounts and that many famous people, including Dorsey himself, had lost followers as a result.
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump suggested Twitter was biased against him, without providing evidence. He wrote on Twitter that the company does not ""treat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory.""
Trump has been upset about losing followers. Trump lost 204,000, or 0.4 percent, of his 53.4 million followers in July, according to social media data firm Keyhole, when Twitter started its purge of suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections.
In October, Trump wrote that ""Twitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship, now it is a Blimp! Total Bias?""
Shares in Twitter jumped 13 percent on Tuesday after it reported quarterly revenue above analyst estimates, which executives said was the result of weeding out spam and abusive posts and targeting ads better.
Trump has one of the most-followed accounts on Twitter. But the president and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly criticized the company and its social media competitors for what they have called bias against conservatives, something Twitter denies.
Democratic U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono said earlier this month: ""We cannot allow the Republican party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful, dangerous and misleading content.""
Carlos Monje, Twitter’s public policy director, said at a Senate hearing earlier this month the site ""does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules.""

278,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>",PG&E get approval to pay employees $350 million to meet safety goals after wildfires,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp can pay employees up to $350 million in bonuses this year to spur them to help meet the bankrupt California power provider's safety goals to prevent wildfires, a judge said on Tuesday.
PG&E's management has said the company needs to implement the bonus plan to carry out tasks such as clearing trees and branches around power lines to avert contact that triggers wildfires. 
While the maximum cost of the plan is $350 million, PG&E has said it expects the likely cost will be around $235 million.
Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco at Tuesday's hearing said he was persuaded to approve the bonus plan, which provides for quarterly payments, after hearing testimony from John Lowe, who is responsible for PG&E's compensation programs.
Lowe said performance targets would be challenging to achieve and that targets for clearing trees and branches could be raised if PG&E's state regulator requires it.
""It was helpful for me to hear from him,"" Montali said. ""Bottom line is I will defer to judgment of management.""
More than half of the plan's formula for calculating bonuses is pegged to how well employees help PG&E meet safety goals. PG&E has said it aims to remove 375,000 trees around power lines this year to avert the potential for its equipment sparking blazes during California's next wildfire season.
The plan covers 2019 and takes the place of a previously proposed 2018 bonus program that PG&E scuttled after criticism from wildfire victims and their lawyers.
Investor-owned PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January facing the prospect of, potentially, billions of dollars in liabilities in the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018 linked or suspected to be linked to its equipment. 
PG&E has said it expects its equipment will be found to have caused November's Camp Fire. The blaze was California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire of modern times, killing 86 people and destroying the town of Paradise.
PG&E in a statement said bonuses will paid only if the company meets its safety goals.
""During a Chapter 11 proceeding taking place in a competitive labor market such as California, it is important to offer appropriate employee compensation and incentives to meet the company’s objectives,"" PG&E added.
On Monday, PG&E Corp said it submitted a proposal with the California Public Utilities Commission, which if approved would increase monthly bills for some electricity customers by 7 percent to help fund about $28 billion in energy infrastructure investments over the next four years, including $21 billion for electric and gas safety and reliability projects.
Also on Monday, PG&E Corp said it had agreed with BlueMountain Capital Management LLC to appoint a new independent director and a safety adviser, resolving a months-long battle with the activist shareholder.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 07:12PM ET</span>","Boeing sees FAA approving software fix in May, MAX ungrounding in July: sources","By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson
CHICAGO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has told some 737 MAX owners it is targeting U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval of its software fix as early as the third week of May and the ungrounding of the aircraft around mid-July, two sources told Reuters.
The dates are part of a provisional timeline that Boeing has shared in meetings with airline customers as it explains an upgrade to software that played a role in two fatal crashes and led to the worldwide grounding of its MAX 737 jetliner in March.
However, Boeing has not yet submitted its completed software package to the FAA for approval, two other sources said.
None of the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said they knew for sure how long the re-certification process will take.
A Boeing spokeswoman said the company is focused on the safe return to service of the MAX and its engagement with global regulators and customers. 
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last week the company had made the final test flight with the new MAX software before a final certification flight, indicating that the company believed it was making progress toward regulatory approval.
On April 1, the FAA said that once it received Boeing's completed software package it would run a rigorous safety review before approving the software for installation.
The agency also plans to work with other international regulators on MAX certification in their countries and regions before lifting the flying suspension in the United States, with Boeing prepared to address any concerns, one source said.
Aside from the software certification, international regulators must also decide on new pilot training.
This process is separate from an FAA-led international review panel, which the agency has said may not be completed before the MAX flying suspension is lifted.
The two largest U.S. MAX owners, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines Group Inc, removed the aircraft from their flying schedules into August but have said they could use their MAX jets as spares if they are ungrounded sooner.
United Airlines, with 14 MAX jets, said last week that it expected the aircraft to return to service this summer, with deliveries resuming before the end of the year.
Boeing halted MAX deliveries to customers after the grounding in mid-March and said earlier this month that it would cut 737 production to 42 airplanes per month from 52.
One industry source said that as of last week, Boeing planned to keep the lower production rate in place for two months, meaning it aims to resume a rate of 52 aircraft in July but the timeline could shift.

Global airlines have had to cancel thousands of flights and use spare aircraft to cover routes that were previously flown with the fuel-efficient MAX.

(Reuters) - EBay Inc raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts on Tuesday, as user-friendly changes to its ecommerce platforms attracted more customers and also increased its advertising revenue.
The company, facing intense competition from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, has focused on its promoted listings program and payments business, as well as worked to make its platform simpler to use through the introduction of grouped listings and personal recommendations.
More than 800,000 active sellers took advantage of the promoted listings in the first quarter, helping more than double advertising revenue to over $65 million, the company said.
Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig on a post-earnings call reiterated that the company was reducing third-party ads that are not accretive and remained on track toward a $1 billion advertising revenue opportunity.
The results come as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is in the middle of a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses following activist investor pressure.
The San Jose, California-based company has also agreed to appoint two new directors to its board as part of an agreement with activist investors Starboard Value and Elliott Management.
""We see the beat and raise as a positive reflection of management's efforts, prior to the involvement of the activist, to improve its operating results - including expanding its efforts in advertising and payments,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson.
EBay's shares rose 5 percent in extended trading after the company also beat first-quarter revenue and profit estimates.
The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to range between $10.83 billion and $10.93 billion, and its profit to be between $2.64 per share and $2.70 per share.
Net revenue rose 2.4 percent to $2.64 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.58 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
EBay said active buyers grew 4 percent to 180 million in the reported quarter. However, the company's gross merchandise volume, which is the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain time frame, fell 4.2 percent to $22.59 billion.
Excluding items, eBay earned 67 cents per share, beating estimates of 63 cents per share.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 06:39PM ET</span>","Snap restarts user growth with original shows, Android overhaul","By Vibhuti Sharma and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Snap Inc's original shows and rebuilt Android app helped it add Snapchat users for the first time in three quarters and top analyst revenue forecasts, but that was not enough to push its shares much higher after a sharp run-up this year. 
Snap said on Tuesday that the number of daily active Snapchat users rose to 190 million in the first quarter from 186 million in the prior period, but remained below the 191 million it had a year earlier.
The figure, widely watched by investors and advertisers, beat analysts' average estimate of 187.2 million daily users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Executives left the company in droves late last year after a widely panned redesign of Snapchat, and any uptick is a welcome sign Snap has stemmed user losses. 
Chief Executive Evan Spiegel has worked to turn Snap's business around while the company largely avoided privacy and other scandals plaguing bigger rivals like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
""We see many opportunities to increase our investments, and we will continue to manage our business for long-term growth,"" Spiegel said during the earnings call with analysts.
Overall revenue jumped nearly 40 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as Snap was able to wring more ad revenue out of each user. 
But Snap did not give specific guidance on any future user growth, and cautioned that user growth rates tend to be higher in the first quarter versus the second quarter. 
Shares of the company, which rose 12 percent immediately after the results, gave up most of their gains to trade up marginally at $12.26 in after-market trading. They have more than doubled in value so far this year. 
""Things are improving at Snap, and that could be putting it mildly - although with the shares up 100% so far this year, that's pretty priced in,"" said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), in a note.
In an effort to increase how much time users spend on the app, Snap, which faces stiff competition from Facebook's Instagram, launched more than 50 shows and publisher stories in international markets alone during the reported quarter. 
It also rebuilt its Android app, which had more bugs and a worse user experience than its iOS app. Snap had prioritized development on the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem through its stock market debut in 2017.
Snap's revenue, which it earns from selling advertising on the app, jumped 39 percent to $320.4 million and beat Wall Street's average estimate of $306.6 million. 
Revenue growth was helped by new ad formats like unskippable commercials on its original shows, which are housed on the Discover page, a panel on the app that contains publisher content along with influencer content. 
Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman said during the analyst call that Snap's ad sales team has restructured in the United States as of April 1 to better serve advertisers according to their industry.
""Snap is maintaining, which is a good place for them considering they still lack any clear direction on how to expand or pivot its app beyond the under 34-year-old demographic,"" said Jessica Liu, a marketing analyst at Forrester. 
Snap's focus on privacy and communication between friends has helped it avoid problems with misinformation and the spread of abusive content, which have been an issue for Facebook and Google's YouTube, two of Snap's main rivals for digital ad dollars.
Average revenue per user jumped 39 percent to $1.68 during the quarter from a year earlier. The company's net loss narrowed to $310.4 million, or 23 cents per share, from $385.8 million, or 30 cents per share.
Excluding items, the company lost 10 cents per share in the quarter, beating analyst estimates of losses of 12 cents per share.
For the second quarter, Snap said it expects revenue of $335 million to $360 million. That compares with the average analyst estimate for revenue of $348.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Earlier this month, Snap launched a gaming platform within its Snapchat app featuring original and third-party games such as Zynga Inc's Tiny Royale.

Spiegel said during the earnings call on Tuesday that Snap Games could eventually help the company make more money from the communication side of the app, as users play games with their friends.

282,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>",Slackening Consumer Demand Reins in Animal Spirits in India,"(Bloomberg) -- Investment and consumption waned in India, latest high-frequency indicators show, putting a brake on growth in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
Overall activity reading generated from eight indicators compiled by Bloomberg News suggest the economy is cooling, with the dot moving one notch to the left in March from a month earlier. That backs government’s forecast for growth to ease to just over 6 percent -- the slowest pace in nearly two years -- in the quarter to March.
While uncertainty over the outcome of a general election cast a shadow on investments, consumer demand has been hit by relatively tight financial conditions. Banks’ reluctance to pass on interest rate cuts to borrowers is proving to be a bugbear for central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das, and it’s fueling expectations for at least one more quarter percentage point rate reduction in the coming months.
Here are the full details of the dashboard:
Business Activity
The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Composite PMI Index fell to a six-month low of 52.7 in March. While a reading above 50 indicates an expansion, the latest number suggests moderation of growth in both manufacturing and services sectors. While job creation in services was at a six-month low, price pressures picked up a tad but was subdued overall.
Exports
Exports growth was a silver lining in what was an otherwise tepid month for economic activity. Outbound shipments grew at the fastest pace in five months in March. Nevertheless, a slowing global economy and the U.S.-China trade war remain a risk to exports, which has trailed growth in imports for most part of the year that ended March 31.
Consumer Activity
Consumer purchases were sluggish, with auto sales -- a key indicator for demand in both rural and urban India -- declining from a year ago. While passenger vehicle sales fell 3 percent from a year ago, those of two-wheelers, including scooters, declined more than 17 percent in March from a year ago.
That was due in part to a crisis in the shadow-banking sector, which was previously in the forefront of lending to consumers.
While banks have stepped in to fill the void left by shadow lenders in the past few months, loan growth in the banking sector is showing signs of moderation. Demand for bank loans grew at 13.2 percent in March from a year ago, slowing from the 14.5 percent pace seen in February, according to central bank data.
The Citi India Financial Conditions Index, a liquidity indicator, showed a moderate increase in March, but overall conditions were pretty tight and kept consumption in a tight leash.
Industrial Activity
Growth in India’s core infrastructure sector, which constitutes 40 percent of total industrial production, grew 2.1 percent in February from a year ago. That was slower than the 5.4 percent expansion seen a year ago, as electricity generation and production of crude oil contracted.
That does not bode well for industrial production, which too slowed sharply. The index barely grew at 0.1 percent in February from a year earlier, with capital goods output contracting sharply from a year earlier. Data for both indicators are reported with a one-month lag.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 06:24PM ET</span>","CBS suspends CEO search, fuelling Viacom merger expectations","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) on Tuesday said it had suspended its search for a new chief executive and extended the role of its interim CEO Joseph Ianniello until the end of the year, renewing speculation the U.S. media company will seek to merge with peer Viacom Inc.
Ianniello, who was previously the company's chief operating officer, became interim CEO in September after the CBS board ousted then-CEO Leslie Moonves over accusations of sexual harassment and assault. 
Ianniello's interim role included a clause stating that if he was not named permanent CEO by June 30, 2019, he could leave the company with severance estimated to reach $70 million, according a source familiar with the matter. The same clause applies to his new agreement ending Dec. 31.
Moonves has denied any wrongdoing.
Speculation over the past few months about CBS considering for the third time a tie-up with Viacom hindered its search for a CEO as candidates worried about how their position could be jeopardized in a potential merger, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Viacom is also controlled by the Redstone family's National Amusements Inc. 
Advocates for a combined CBS-Viacom company believe it would have greater scale to compete in a rapidly consolidating media world led by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. 

Extending Ianniello's role as interim CEO and dropping the search for a permanent CEO appears to set a time frame for how long CBS believes it would take to complete a deal.

DALLAS (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co shareholders voted to elect all of the company-nominated directors during a rowdy meeting on Tuesday in which more than a dozen attendees were kicked out for heckling executives and board members. 
Though protesters and activists dominated most of the meeting, the shareholder vote reflected growing investor confidence in management. All the directors were elected with no less than 95 percent approval, according to the preliminary tally. A year ago, directors were elected with 89 percent approval.
The majority of the San Francisco-based bank's 12 board members joined Wells Fargo after the bank became mired in scandal in late 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Board Chair Betsy Duke and interim Chief Executive Allen Parker faced questions about why investors should vote for the five directors who were at the bank at the time of the wrongdoing.
Last month, proxy research firm Institutional Shareholder Services advised ""cautionary support"" of directors who were at the bank prior to 2017.
About 15 activists were kicked out of the meeting for interrupting Parker's remarks, as part of coordinated demonstrations by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA). Parker had repeatedly asked them to wait for the question-and-answer segment before having security evict them.
""One of the wonderful things about shareholder democracy is that we have meetings like this,"" said Parker as the activists were escorted out.
NACA CEO Bruce Marks, who has a history of protesting at bank shareholder meetings, helped members buy individual shares so they could attend the meeting, he told Reuters. 
The group, a non-profit mortgage broker, plans to attend Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's shareholder meeting on Wednesday to thank the bank for committing billions of dollars to low- and moderate-income mortgages.
The demonstrators spoke about fair lending practices, African American homeownership and fake accounts. Some called Wells Fargo executives ""frauds"" and said the bank could not be trusted.
Wells Fargo's annual meetings have drawn protesters every year since its fake account scandal in 2016. Since the initial revelations, regulators and the bank have uncovered problems in each of the bank's primary business segments. The scandals at the fourth-largest U.S. lender have resulted in billions of fines and penalties and claimed two CEOs after Tim Sloan announced his resignation last month.
Board Chair Duke said at the meeting Tuesday a search for an external candidate is underway and that the board would not comment on the search process until a selection is finalized.

Shareholders also approved executive pay and other management proposals. Two shareholder proposals that were rejected called for transparency about incentive pay and closing of the median gender pay gap.

(Reuters) - Chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) said on Tuesday a slowdown in demand for microchips that started late last year may last a few more quarters. The warning from the company, often seen as a bellwether for a semiconductor industry, dragged its shares 3 percent lower to $113.88.
""We have just completed our second quarter of year-on-year decline for TI... But typically, the industry would have 4 to 5 quarters of year-on-year declines before growth resumes,"" Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said in a conference call with analysts.
""We are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective.""
Chipmakers have been struggling with declining demand in China as its economy slows and manufacturers face the fallout of an ongoing trade dispute with the United States.
Texas Instruments had signaled last quarter that the semiconductor cycle is on a downward turn after over 10 quarters of constant growth and that trade tensions could ""impact the depth and duration of this cycle.""
In the reported quarter, revenue and profit were lower from a year earlier as demand continued to slow across most markets, but higher sales of chips that are powering the rollout of 5G telecom network helped TI beat Wall Street estimates.
However, Lizardi said he expected the demand for the communication chips to be choppy in the future. 
Two Wall Street analysts said the growth in the communication unit has been masking the slowdown in TI's core businesses such as industrial and automotives, and that ""is not sustainable"". 
TI said it expects second-quarter revenue to be between $3.46 billion and $3.74 billion and earnings per share of between $1.12 per share and $1.32 per share.
Analysts were expecting revenue of $3.67 billion and profit of $1.24 per share for the second-quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""The outlook is weaker than consensus, but not as bad as feared,"" said Hans Mosemann, analyst from Rosenblatt Securities.
Revenue in the first quarter fell 5.1 percent to $3.59 billion, but beat analysts' average estimate of $3.48 billion.
Net income fell to $1.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, for the quarter ended March 31 from $1.37 billion or $1.35 a share a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.22 per share to beat Wall Street expectation of $1.13 per share.

(Reuters) - Four of the largest U.S. beef-packing companies were accused in a lawsuit on Tuesday of violating federal antitrust law by conspiring to drive down prices they paid ranchers for cattle, even as retail beef prices hovered near record levels.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), Cargill Inc, the JBS USA unit of Brazil's JBS SA and National Beef Packing Co were accused of colluding since Jan. 2015 to suppress the price of ""fed"" cattle, which is cattle raised specifically for beef production, with a goal of improving margins and profitability.
The 104-page complaint by the Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America (R-CALF) and four cattle-feeding ranchers was filed in Chicago federal court, and seeks compensatory, punitive and triple damages.
It resembles litigation in the same court in which companies, including Tyson and JBS, have been accused of conspiring to fix prices of broiler chickens and pork.
Tyson said the lawsuit was ""baseless,"" and that as in the chicken and pork lawsuits there was no merit to the claim it colluded. ""Tyson wants its suppliers to succeed,"" it added.
The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the complaint, Tyson, Cargill, JBS and National Beef conspired to suppress prices through such tactics as importing foreign cattle at a loss, closing slaughter plants, and reducing slaughter and purchase volumes.
The conspiracy ""encouraged an apprehension amongst producers that they might not be able to 'get their cattle dead'"" unless prices were cut, and led to an artificial 7.9 percent average reduction in fed cattle prices, the complaint said.
Tyson, Cargill, JBS and National Beef controlled more than 81 percent of the market for U.S. fed cattle in 2017, with more than $48 billion of beef sales in that fiscal year, the complaint said.
The lawsuit is meant to ""prevent the Big 4 packers from capturing the U.S. cattle market from independent U.S. cattle producers,"" R-CALF Chief Executive Bill Bullard said in a statement provided by the group's lawyers. ""We hope U.S. cattle ranchers can be compensated for years of significant losses.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street set a record high on Tuesday, confirming that a decade-old bull market is still kicking following a slump late last year, even as corporate earnings stagnate and the U.S.-China trade dispute drags on.
The widely followed S&P 500 marked its highest ever close, beating its previous record closing high on Sept. 20, and the Nasdaq beat its Aug. 29 all-time closing high.
The S&P 500 has rallied 25% from Dec. 24, reversing a steep selloff caused by fears of higher interest rates and uncertainty around U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing. Dec. 24 marked the bottom of last year's selloff. 
The S&P 500 has slightly underperformed European stocks over the same time period.
(Graphic: S&P 500 vs. world indices Image link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W3escq).
But as the S&P 500 has recovered, corporate earnings growth has slowed, and even shrunk, following a surge last year on the back of deep U.S.corporate tax cuts. Analysts on average expect earnings per share for the quarter to fall 1.3% year over year, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
(Graphic: Q1 earnings expectations link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W65kUo).
While expectations for first-quarter EPS have improved over the past three weeks, forecasts for full 2019 EPS growth have become less optimistic, now at 3.0% growth, down from 3.3% at the start of the month. That is partly due to uncertainty related to global trade.
(Graphic: S&P 500 2019 earnings expectations link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W4aRe7).
Higher stock prices and expectations for slower earnings growth have pushed forward price/earnings multiples back up to the levels that worried some investors the last time Wall Street peaked. The S&P 500's forward PE stands at almost 17, up from 14 at the start of the year, according to Datastream.

292,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. AT&T, Boeing, Caterpillar and More
As the earnings parade continues tomorrow, AT&T I(NYSE:T) reports tomorrow before the bell, following mixed results from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) today. Analysts are forecasting a profit of 86 cents per share on revenue of about $45 billion.
It’s not too long ago that these two telecom giants (now communications services companies according to S&P) would be all about wireless customers. But not today.
Verizon lost 44,000 wireless customers in its most recent quarter. But in AT&T’s case that metric will likely take a back seat given its control of Time Warner, with attention more on how HBO plans to battle Disney’s new streaming service Disney+.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) will also issue results, with analysts looking for earnings of $3.23 per share and revenue of $23 billion. Investors will want updates on the company’s grounded 737 MAX jetliner.
Fellow industrial  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) will also report. Analysts are forecasting a profit of $2.83 a share on revenue of $13.3 billion.
Also reporting are defense companies General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ).
2. Facebook, Microsoft Headline Postmarket Earnings
After the bell tomorrow the earnings calendar will be a tale of two techs: social media pioneer Facebook and software stalwart Microsoft.
On average, analysts expect that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) earned $1.61 per share in its first quarter, with revenue of about $15 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
As usual with social media companies, user engagement will also be closely watched. The company reported 2.32 billion monthly active users (MAUs) for the fourth quarter, which was up 9% from the year-ago period. Stock research firm Trefis predicts similar growth for the latest quarter, with MAUs rising to $2.5 billion by the end of 2020.
For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), analysts are predicting a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) of $1 per share on revenue of about $32.7 billion.
The big takeaway will be the company’s cloud computing business, which is now the growth driver of sales. Its commercial cloud revenue rose 48% overall last quarter from the year-ago period. Revenue for cloud service Azure rose 76%, a sizable gain, but the same as the fiscal first quarter, raising some worries growth is leveling off.
Last month Mizuho initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy, citing strong potential given 15% to 20% of work worldwide is done on the cloud, Barron’s reported.
3. Build in Crude Stockpiles Set to Resume?
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a build in weekly crude supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute data released Tuesday, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. It showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 6.9 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 1.255 million barrels for the week ended April 19. Crude inventories snapped a three-week build in the prior week, falling by 1.396 million barrels.
U.S. weekly production, which remains near record highs despite falling to 12.1 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention.
Crude oil futures hit fresh 2019 highs, settling 1.1% higher at $66.30 today."
293,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",U.S. tractor maker AGCO rolls out Fendt line for Brazil farmers,"By Marcelo Teixeira
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. agricultural machine maker AGCO Corp said on Tuesday it would launch its flagship Fendt line of equipment in Brazil later this year, targeting large soybean farmers in the vast center-west region.
AGCO will first bring the German-made line of Fendt Vario high-power tractors to Brazil's grain heartland, the company's South America chief Luís Felli said at a presentation in Sao Paulo.
Next year AGCO plans to launch sales of Fendt's biggest-yet planters and harvesters that will be produced in two plants in Brazil, looking to lure the largest-scale farming groups, he said.
Felli said most items were designed in Brazil specifically for the needs of grain producers in the center-west states such as Mato Grosso and Goiás, where much of the country's soybean and corn is produced.
""Everybody nowadays wants to produce two crops per year in Brazil. The windows for harvesting and planting are small. You need to gain speed, and these equipment will give you speed,"" he said.
Fendt South America division will be headquartered in Sorriso, right along at the key BR-163 grain-shipping road, in the northern part of Mato Grosso state. It will sell 40-line planters that carry seeds and fertilizer and can be folded to be transported to other areas.
""The largest planters of that kind until today had 17 lines, so this could make a big difference in a large farm,"" Felli said.
According to him, if conditions are right, precision planters could go as fast as 12 kilometers per hour (km/h) in the field, compared to 5 km/h for a conventional planter.
AGCO will also sell Fendt harvesters with up to 50-feet long platforms and internal storage for as much as 220 60-kg bags of soybeans (485 bushels).
Felli says Brazil has at least 10,000 farmers with 5,000 hectares or more each, a large scale farming not seen anywhere else, boosting sales potential for large, powerful machinery.
The company has invested 150 million reais ($38.30 million) so far to bring the Fendt line to South America.

294,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 04:41PM ET</span>","Snap Tops Forecasts, Jumps More After Hours","Investing.com - Social media company Snap added to regular-session gains post-market after beating analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines and on user engagement.
The Snapchat owner reported a loss of 10 cents a share for its first quarter, narrower than expectations of a loss of 22 cents per share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Revenue of $320.4 million topped expectations of $305.5 million.
Results were helped by the popularity of its original shows and the launch of a new Android app.
The company’s daily active users (DAUs), its chief engagement metric, came in at 190 million, above estimates of about 187 million, according to Briefing.com.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares rose 3.8% in after-hours trading to $12.46.
Shares closed at $12 during regular trading, up about 4% thanks to enthusiasm over Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) quarterly numbers.
Looking ahead, the company predicted second-quarter revenue between $335 million and $360 million, in line with the consensus estimate from S&P Capital IQ.
In an effort to increase the amount of time users spend on the app, Snap, which faces stiff competition from Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram, launched over 50 new shows in the reported quarter.
It also rebuilt its Android app, which had more bugs and a worse user experience than its iOS app. The targeting of Android users is a change of tune for Snap, which prioritized development on the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem through its stock market launch in 2017.
Snap's focus on privacy and communication between friends has helped it avoid problems with misinformation and spread of unsavory content, which have plagued Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, two of its rivals for digital ad dollars.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq registered record closing highs after a broadbased rally on Tuesday, as a clutch of better-than-expected earnings reports eased concerns about a slowdown.
In Tuesday's trading the benchmark index finally erased all the steep losses it saw in late 2018 by ending the day above the previous record reached on Sept. 20. It closed just 0.3% below its intra-day record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21.
The S&P has risen 17 percent so far this year, with help from a dovish Federal Reserve and hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution as well as the upbeat start to the first-quarter earnings season. 
""Part of what's pushing the S&P up is a general belief it will make a new high,"" said Rick Meckler of Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, who expects that more earnings reports later in the week could push the index above its all-time high. 
The diversity of industry sectors reporting strong results on Tuesday gave further reassurance to Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware, who expects the trend to continue.
""Today was a very broadly representative day of the overall economy. That's what's driving the markets,"" said Roth citing results from United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. 
""If the earnings season is as strong as we expect the next major signpost is the trade situation with China and getting that resolved,"" said Roth.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 145.34 points, or 0.55%, to 26,656.39, the S&P 500 gained 25.71 points, or 0.88%, to 2,933.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 105.56 points, or 1.32%, to 8,120.82.
Profits of S&P 500 companies are still expected to decline 1.3% in the first quarter, in what analysts say could be the first earnings contraction since 2016. However, forecasts have largely improved since the start of April.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), set to report results later this week, gained 2.2%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with a rebound in healthcare, which gained 1.6%, providing the biggest boost. The healthcare sector has been slammed with 6.7% drop in the last two weeks on U.S. policy concerns. 
""People just realized (healthcare) got beaten so far down it might be worth taking a chance,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. 
The consumer staples sector was the only S&P sector that ended the day lower as investors favored riskier bets. The energy and utilities sectors were the next weakest performers on the day. 
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares soared 15.6% after the social media company posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a surprise increase in monthly active users.
 Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) rose 14.2% after the toymaker reported a surprise quarterly profit.
Coca-Cola rose 1.7% after its quarterly sales beat estimates, helped in part by strong demand for Coke Zero.
Lockheed Martin jumped 5.7% after it reported upbeat quarterly results and lifted its full-year profit forecast on strong demand for its missiles and fighter jets.
United Technologies rose 2.3% after it raised its full-year profit forecast. 
Procter & Gamble Co fell 2.6% and was the biggest drag on the market after reporting a decline in its third-quarter operating margin.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.82-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 45 new lows.

301,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",Will Netflix Junk Bonds Wilt Amid the Content Wars?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- By now, tapping the debt markets is nothing new for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). Just as it did in October, the streaming giant plans to issue $2 billion of junk-rated bonds denominated in dollars and euros. It has borrowed at least once a year since 2013 in an effort to build up a huge library of shows that gives subscribers a reason to renew month after month.
What is new, though, is the level of competition bearing down on Netflix from behemoths like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. Bond investors ought to take the escalating content war seriously when placing orders for this new deal. After all, it could throw a wrench into the company’s timeline for turning cash-flow positive.
Netflix, as usual, will use the bond proceeds for general corporate purposes including investments in content, production and development, according to a company statement. Just last week, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings declared on a call after the company’s first-quarter results that “our message to debt investors is you better get in soon, because it’s not going to be that much more to go.” Effectively, the sort of cash burn that Netflix has been known for will be a thing of the past. That’s the sort of promise that helped the company win upgrades last year from Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
It’s nice to imagine Netflix as a profitable, self-funding company. And it seems likely that could happen “over time,” as Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said. In the more immediate future, however, it’s hard to see how it can afford to coast when the competition has never been greater, and especially after a quarter in which it fell short of analysts’ estimates for new subscribers. My Bloomberg Opinion colleagues Shira Ovide and Tara Lachapelle have extensively chronicled the fight over content. Netflix’s share of the pie is far from guaranteed, though Moody’s expects it “will be a foundation” streaming video service in a sea of choices.
Whether that means it will need to keep coming back to the junk-bond market in the years ahead remains to be seen, but it certainly seems more likely than Hastings appears to suggest. Moody’s leans on the word “gradually” in its report when discussing expectations for deleveraging — it projects the company can break even on cash flow by 2023, which somehow feels both close and far away. Stephen Flynn at Bloomberg Intelligence estimates Netflix will issue more debt in 2020. The company expects to improve its cash flow starting next year, but that’s a low bar considering it recently boosted its 2019 cash-burn forecast to $3.5 billion.
That’s a lot for bond investors to consider. Then again, it might not matter given the state of the high-yield market. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index has rallied a staggering 8.4 percent already in 2019, with the average spread to Treasuries at about the same level as when the company last borrowed in October. The benchmark 10-year yield, meanwhile, has tumbled 50 basis points since then. It’s possible that Netflix could see its lowest borrowing costs since 2017.
Still, it doesn’t seem worth it to chase yields much lower than that, and especially not for fear of a Netflix bond shortage. The company’s own 10-Q seems to confirm debt sales are still part of the plan: “We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and free cash flows for many years.”
There’s a very real risk that Netflix’s projections don’t pan out. Anyone can say that about any company, of course, but it feels especially true at this time for the on-demand video streaming industry. Netflix can go ahead and tell bond investors it won’t need them forever, but it looks likely it’ll still need them for a long time if it wants to win the content war."
302,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 03:04PM ET</span>",Egypt to turn to private sector to restore historic buildings,"By Patrick Werr
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's government is drawing up a plan to turn over as many as 150 crumbling historic buildings to the private sector to refurbish and lease out for profit, the Minister of Public Enterprise said on Tuesday. 
The plan could potentially save an eclectic mix of neo-classical, beaux arts, art nouveaux, art deco and early modern styles built mostly in the first half of the 20th century then nationalized in the early 1960s. 
It could also revitalize important tourism districts in central Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said on the Suez Canal. 
The buildings have fallen into various degrees of disrepair for lack of funding and maintenance, with many tenants paying tiny sums for units that have remained rent-controlled for more than half a century. 
Public enterprise minister Hesham Tawfik said the government would follow the model of privately owned Al Ismaelia for Real Estate Investment, which has been slowly renovating 23 historic buildings it has bought in downtown Cairo. 
""They take the buildings, they settle with individuals or companies who are renting these apartments, they do the necessary renovations, inside and outside, and they simply rent them to the private sector. And they are making some decent return on their investment,"" Tawfik said. 
""We intend to do this by offering parcels of buildings, and by parcels I mean four to five buildings per transaction, for the private sector to repeat what Ismaelia did, on a revenue-sharing basis,"" he said at business conference. 
The plan was being studied at the state Insurance Holding Co. which along with the state insurance company owns 350 buildings, 150 of which are classified as historic. 
""Probably they will come up with something very soon to offer to private developers, who we will insist be Ismaelia-style, with the right social background to be able to make sure that the development is done at the right level,"" Tawfik said.
REPAYING DEBTS
The government was also preparing to sell about 2 million square meters of unused land owned by state holding companies to help pay back more than 38 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.22 billion) in debts owed to other public entities, he said. 
These include the National Investment Bank, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Electricity, pension funds and the tax authority.
Once paid, any extra proceeds will be used to finance restructuring plans for companies under the ministry, including 21 billion pounds for textile industry and 5 billion pounds for chemical and metallurgical industries, Tawfik said.

“Stone is extremely expensive,” said Joao Braga, co-head of equities at XP Asset Management, one of Brazil’s best performing hedge-fund managers, in an interview.
According to Braga, the stock is pricing in a lot of growth “that may not come” and could fall to below $20 per share “amid a storm of bad news.” Stone priced an upsized initial public offering last October, with investors like billionaires Warren Buffett and Alibaba’s Jack Ma agreeing to pay $24 a share.
The Brazilian firm fell 24 percent last Thursday, its biggest tumble on record, after Itau Unibanco Holding SA’s card-acquiring unit Rede announced plans to eliminate the fees for prepayments on some credit card transactions, fueling concerns of an accelerating price war in the sector and prompting similar moves by competitors.
“It’s difficult to understand the stock’s current price,” said Leonardo Rufino, a portfolio manager at Pacifico Gestao de Recursos. “The multiples are quite elevated, the competition may become even harsher and the company needs to deliver a huge growth,” Rufino said. The stock is currently trading at 31 times estimated earnings, versus 9 times for Cielo SA, its biggest competitor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A spokesperson for StoneCo declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg. In a letter to shareholders last Friday, Chief Executive Officer Thiago Piau wrote that the company is “always monitoring our competitive landscape and taking note of various marketing programs, competitor initiatives and potential anti-competitive actions.""
Increased competition
""Stone may be able to compete with differentiated service but they also seem very vulnerable,"" said Bradford Jones, a money manager at Sagil Asset Management in London.
Brazil’s biggest payments company Cielo SA has been slashing prices to defend market share, amid increasingly challenging competition. On Monday, PagSeguro Digital Ltd announced the launch of a service that will allow merchants to instantly receive the proceeds from debit and credit cards purchases. The recent wave of price cuts was triggered by  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, which targeted smaller merchants with cheaper products.
AllianceBernstein’s portfolio manager Morgan Harting is also staying away from Brazilian payments firms at this moment. “We see better opportunities elsewhere, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which has a more clearly dominant position in payments.”
“The weak momentum in these names calls into question how favorable the prospects for their competitive positions are,” Harting said.
Stone shares fell as much as 4 percent in New York on Tuesday. The company’s IPO lock-up is expiring today, according to Bloomberg data."
306,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",‘Extreme’ Stock-Valuation Gap Looms Over Gravity-Defying Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- As the S&P 500 approaches all-time highs, defensive investing styles are trading at their most overbought levels in decades -- a sign of investor incredulity at this gravity-defying rally.
Something may have to give.
Growth shares have surged to the highest levels versus cheap equities since the dot-com bubble, underscoring fierce demand for companies less exposed to the gyrations of the economic cycle. Stocks posting a strong return on equity are near their most expensive since 1990, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. To cap it all, tech multiples have jumped toward 2009 highs relative to the broader gauge.
It all suggests an “extreme” valuation gap is setting the stock market up for a rotation away from winners in favor of the losers, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), echoing a growing number of Wall Street strategists.
“It is pretty clear that the market is fairly bifurcated at this point with growth and defensive companies designated as winners and everything else a loser,” Morgan Stanley strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a Monday note. “That’s a classic late-cycle playbook but it does appear to have gotten a bit extreme at this point.”
Despite one of the best starts for global equities in decades, economic angst and the weaker trajectory for corporate earnings are spurring investors to crowd into the strongest companies, from healthy balance sheets, low volatility equities to the FAANG.
Among smart-beta products, exchange-traded funds tracking quality stocks saw their biggest inflows last week since January, belying ultra-low cross-asset volatility.
With money managers paying a hefty premium for defensive bets, many of the stocks best positioned to ride an economic downturn now look overbought, according to Bernstein.
“With a U.S. recession widely expected at some point over the next 12-18 months and very little earnings growth forecast in Europe, many wish to be positioned in ""Quality,” strategists led by Sarah McCarthy wrote in a note last week. “However the valuations seem prohibitive.”
Bernstein recommends European stocks with high earnings quality, which favors metrics like steady profit forecasts, and global shares with low leverage.
Shifting Tide
Cyclical sectors overall have posted aggressive gains this year but the likes of materials and financials -- likely overweights in value funds -- have underperformed markedly.
Still, there are nascent signs of an investing shift less friendly to the market leaders and kinder to the laggards.
Relative to the U.S. benchmark, a gauge of American banks has rebounded 4 percent from a 2 1/2-year low reached in March. Meanwhile, the woes afflicting health care thanks to proposed policy changes are a reminder that the most-loved sectors can fall out of favor on a dime.
As recovering bond yields weigh on valuation multiples, cheaper equities may look more attractive. Since October, value’s weighting in portfolios tracking the price-momentum factor has increased at the expense of growth, a trend that could spur inflows into the investing style, according to Morgan Stanley.
In sum, the most-loved equities look decidedly expensive in this melt-up. And all bets are off on how they will fare in any correction, with the projected earnings expansion for growth stocks this year not much stronger than peers, Wilson and team note.
“The next leg of this rotation could occur during an overall correction in the S&P 500 as growth stocks go down a lot more than value given their higher relative valuations,” the strategists wrote. “The difference this time is that we think the correction will be driven more by disappointing earnings growth rather than higher interest rates.”"
307,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>","Twitter shares jump, ascribes growth to fight against abuse","By Angela Moon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) jumped 13 percent on Tuesday after the social media company reported quarterly revenue above analyst estimates, which executives said was the result of weeding out spam and abusive posts and targeting ads better.
New ad formats, partnerships with content providers like the U.S. National Basketball Association and efforts to patrol abusive content are helping Twitter better compete for advertising dollars, executives said.
Social media companies have been under pressure over privacy concerns and political influence activity. Twitter has removed thousands of spam and suspicious accounts, which it blamed for sequential declines in monthly users in recent quarters. 
Twitter executives said they saw opportunities for selling ads that earn revenue when users visit websites or download apps, citing success with major brands like Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. The company is looking to grow its sales team in 2019 to better serve big advertisers. 
""Something where you see a blending of performance and brand is the Star Trek ad that Disney is running right now, where I click through to make sure that I'd be notified when more information was available about the next Star Wars,"" Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told analysts.
Twitter said pre-roll ads, or promotional messages that play before videos, are also growing. 
The company said its monthly active users (MAU) rose 9 million to 330 million from the previous quarter, much better than Wall Street's average estimate that it would lose 2.2 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Still, MAUs were down 6 million from a year earlier. 
It was Twitter's last quarter of disclosing MAUs. 
From now on it will only provide ""monetizable"" daily active users (mDAUs), created to measure people exposed to advertising and exclude those who access Twitter via text messages or aggregating sites like TweetDeck. 
For the first quarter, Twitter said mDAUs rose to 134 million, up 12 percent from a year ago. 
Analysts were encouraged by signs the company had found ways to sustainably grow users and revenue, but said the new way of measuring users could make comparisons with rivals like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) more difficult. 
""People are not impressed with a made up metric and their reluctance to give us actual users,"" said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities. ""I don’t think the stock can get out of its own way until they come clean and report the same metrics everyone else does.""
FORECAST LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET 
For the first quarter, Twitter's revenue rose 18 percent to $787 million from the year-ago quarter, topping analyst estimates of $776.1 million. 
But Twitter also forecast revenue for the second quarter largely below analyst estimates, and said that it would continue to spend heavily on cleaning up Twitter as well as new ad products. 
Ad sales jumped 18 percent to $679 million. In the United States, ad revenue rose by 26 percent. 
Total operating expense including cost of revenue rose by 18 percent from the first quarter a year ago. The company reiterated that operating expenses would grow about 20 percent in 2019. 
Twitter reported quarterly profit of $191 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a $124.4 million tax benefit, the company earned 9 cents per share. 
The results appeared to catch the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who called for the creation of ""more, and fairer"" social media companies, repeating his claim that Twitter is biased against Republicans, without presenting evidence.

""We enforce the Twitter Rules dispassionately and equally for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation,"" a Twitter representative said. ""We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.""

Brazil's Congress is mulling the government's pension reform proposal, which many view as crucial to stabilizing the country's rickety public finances and kick-starting growth in Latin America's No. 1 economy. 
Speaking in Sao Paulo, Christian Egan said ""there may be room"" for follow-on operations from companies with higher valuation levels.
""It's case-by-case, but IPOs would be unlocked much faster (with the reform approved),"" he said.
Egan said there is great interest from foreign investors in Brazil, who are awaiting the for the passing of the pensions overhaul to invest, particularly in areas like infrastructure.

Also on Tuesday, Brazil's government reached a deal with lawmakers, paving the way for a congressional committee to vote on its pension bill later in the day, boosting investor sentiment and lifting local financial markets.

Snap (NYSE:SNAP), parent company of popular photo-sharing app Snapchat, rose 4% as Twitter's better-than-expected monthly active user growth helped sentiment.
In February, Snap said it was ""cautiously optimistic,"" adding that it does ""not foresee a sequential decline in daily active users in Q1 2019.""
The company said in February daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2018 were flat quarter on quarter at 186 million and down from 187 million a year earlier.
Ahead of Snap's report, analysts, on average, expect daily active users to exceed about 187 million.
Nomura Instinet analyst Mark Kelley is expecting 186 million daily active users. Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris estimated Snap will add 188 million DAUs.
Commentary on Snap's revamped Android app is also expected to feature heavily as the company has been hard at work to bring performance of the Android version up to par with the iOS app.
Ahead of the earnings report, eMarketer suggested the company may report its first ever decline in U.S. monthly users in the first quarter. But Snap was quick to downplay concerns, disputing the methodology eMarketer used in its study.
Snap, which is up about 70% since its fourth-quarter results, is expected to report a quarterly loss of 22 cents per share, according to Investing.com, on revenue of $305.5 million.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, analysts expect Snap to guide for a loss of 9 cents a share on $348 million in revenue."
311,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 01:38PM ET</span>",Lyft's IPO banks give troubled stock a flurry of 'buy' ratings,"By Noel Randewich and Jasmine I S
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) received some badly needed support on Tuesday, as analysts at banks that had worked on its initial public offering urged clients to buy the ride-hailing company's beleaguered shares. 
Following the required 25-day wait for deal underwriters to issue an investment opinion following an IPO, at least 10 of the banks that brought Lyft public gave positive recommendations on a stock that has slumped 30 percent from its opening price on March 29, its first day of trading.
KeyBank appeared to be the only bank launching coverage on Tuesday that did not recommend buying Lyft, instead assigning it a ""sector weight"" rating and warning of slowing growth.
As of Tuesday, 14 out of 22 analysts covering Lyft recommended buying the stock, seven were ""neutral"" and one recommended selling.
Lyft's stock slump since its IPO has raised concerns about the valuation of larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc as it prepares to promote its own long-anticipated public listing, expected next month. 
Both companies have warned they may never become profitable, making it difficult for investors to estimate how much they might be worth.
""Uber's filing has added pressure, and we acknowledge that the upcoming roadshow could create more near-term uncertainty, but we believe Lyft continues to execute well,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in his research report, assigning Lyft a $68 price target. The stock was trading Tuesday afternoon at $60.79.
Before Tuesday, only banks that had not worked on Lyft's IPO were permitted to offer recommendations on the stock, and the balance of opinion in that group was decidedly more skeptical. Just four of them had recommended Lyft's shares, while six initiated the stock as a ""hold"" and one as a ""sell.""
Despite regulations that separate investment banking and research operations, it is rare for analysts at banks that have participated in an IPO to recommend selling that stock when they issue their initial opinions.
Even after Tuesday's ""buy"" ratings, the stock dipped 0.5%.
Due to its lack of profitability and dual class share structure guaranteeing insiders control of the company, Lyft is not eligible to be included in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index. But if it were, its poor average analyst rating would rank it in the bottom 10% of the benchmark index, among companies including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), according to Refinitiv data.
""We expect steady deceleration in market growth and Lyft's pace of share gain, which seems likely to prevent revenue and adjusted EBITDA from meaningfully exceeding our expectations,"" KeyBank analyst Andy Hargreaves.
Piper Jaffray expected ""solid near-term top line results,"" saying Lyft had been gaining market share in recent quarters, but that the path to positive net income would be a ""multi-year journey."" It initiated coverage with an overweight rating and target price of $78.
Most of the analysts were confident of Lyft's long-term fortunes, despite the competition from Uber.
Reuters has reported that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. Its IPO is on track for some time in May.
Lyft has a stock market value of around $17 billion. 

At least six of Lyft's underwriters, including Canaccord, Cowen and JMP Securities, are also backing the Uber deal, according to SEC filings.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>","P&G operating margin, grooming product sales dip on strong dollar; shares drop","By Richa Naidu and Soundarya J
(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co reported a decline in its third-quarter operating margin on Tuesday and said a strong U.S. dollar hurt sales of its grooming products, sending shares of the maker of Tide and Gillette products down as much as 3.3% in morning trading.
Soaring commodity and transportation costs have eroded margins across the consumer goods industry over the past year. P&G said its core operating margin declined by 60 basis points to 19.9%, and was hurt by foreign exchange fluctuations. 
This was considerably below the estimates of some analysts. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj, for example, forecast an operating margin of 20.9%.
The world's no.1 maker of personal care goods, which gets more than half its sales from outside North America, has tried to offset the higher costs by upgrading several products and then raising their prices. 
Indeed, price hikes on P&G's skincare and detergent lines, which include Tide, Olay and SK-II, helped the Cincinatti-based company beat revenue and profit estimates.
""We're pricing to recover the costs not to recover the margin, and so we typically see margin compression,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call to discuss earnings. Moeller said he expected P&G's operating margin to grow again ""going forward.""
Higher prices are often met with resistance from retailers, but Moeller said the rises had stuck so far.
P&G, which also makes Pampers diapers and Febreze air fresheners, reported a 5 percent rise in organic sales, a keenly watched metric that excludes the impact of currency changes and mergers and acquisitions. Price hikes contributed 2 percentage points to organic sales growth.
Some rivals, too, have benefited after raising prices. Kimberly Clark Corp, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said on Monday it beat first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates by hiking prices and cutting operating costs to offset a stronger dollar and higher raw material costs.
Still, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations dragged organic sales down by 1% at P&G's grooming business, which makes Gillette razors, gels and foams, some of the company's most internationally distributed products.
Shares of P&G were down 2.5% at $103.37.
Organic sales from fabric and home care, P&G's biggest unit, surged 7%. The beauty business saw a 9% rise in organic sales, helped by the premium SK-II brand.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said that while she approved of the price hikes and sales growth in beauty, she was concerned about weak sales at P&G's grooming and baby care businesses. 
Net income rose to $2.75 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Excluding items, the company earned $1.06 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.03 per share.

Net sales rose 1.1 percent to $16.46 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $16.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Fed proposes blueprint for bank-controlling companies,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday proposed a framework for determining when a company has taken control of a bank and must face more rigorous oversight and restrictions, a move that could remove hurdles for banks seeking to attract investors and partners.
The new proposal would for the first time establish clear standards for when the central bank considers a company as taking control of a financial institution, which could be a boon for banks and investors who have had to tread cautiously as such determinations previously were made on a case-by-case basis.
A company that gains control of a bank is considered a bank holding company and, as a result, is subject to Fed supervision and a host of restrictions on other business activities.
The Fed's efforts to clarify its thinking on bank control could help banks looking for new investors or partners, including private equity or fintech firms, without subjecting them to banking regulations and other restrictions, according to analysts.
Randal Quarles, the Fed's vice chair for supervision, said in a prepared statement the regulator's prior practice of determining bank control had become ""one of the more ad hoc and complicated areas of the board's regulatory administration.""
""The proposal would improve the transparency of the board’s control framework by placing substantially all of the board’s control positions into a comprehensive public regulation,"" Quarles said.
The proposal is largely similar with the Fed's existing practices on bank control standards, but is now being made formal through a proposed rule, according to Fed officials.
Specifically, the Fed is attempting to write a blueprint for when a company exerts a ""controlling influence"" over a bank, which can include a combination of factors such as size of investment, number of seats held on the board, and additional business relationships.
Broadly, the proposal requires companies with greater percentages of voting shares in a bank to have less input in other factors. 
For example, a company with 15 percent to 24.9 percent of the voting shares in a bank must have business relationships with the bank that amount to less than 2 percent of its revenue or expenses without being considered a controlling interest.
By comparison, a company with just 5 percent to 9.9 percent of voting shares could have a business relationship worth nearly 10 percent of its revenue and expenses.

The Fed board is set to vote on the proposal at an open meeting later on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit southeast Michigan on Wednesday to make the case that the North American trade deal intended to replace NAFTA would boost the auto industry, the White House said on Tuesday.
Pence will speak at an event with automakers and auto suppliers in Taylor, Michigan and will tour a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co truck plant in Dearborn as the administration works to convince Congress to ratify the new trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Also set to attend and speak on a panel ahead of Pence's remarks are the chief executives of two major auto suppliers - Dana Inc and Magna International Inc - as well as executives from Ford, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
The Michigan Manufacturers Association and two auto supplier associations will host the event.
Pence will also attend an event in the Detroit area for the 2020 Trump re-election campaign.
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday estimated that under the deal U.S. auto industry employment would rise by 30,000 jobs for parts and engine production, but that the number of U.S. vehicle assembly jobs would decline. U.S. vehicle prices would rise up to 1.6 percent, causing consumption to fall by 140,000 units per year, or about 1.25 percent of 2017 sales, the report said.
The Trump administration and U.S. automakers disputed the ITC report, saying instead that the new trade deal would create 76,000 automotive sector jobs within five years as automakers invest some $34 billion in new plants to comply with the pact’s new regional content rules.
The auto industry is deeply concerned about the Trump administration's consideration of whether to impose up to 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and parts on national security grounds.
The industry fears those tariffs would add thousands of dollars to the cost of vehicles and potentially cost hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the U.S. economy. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to act on confidential recommendations of a report looking into the possible tariffs by mid-May.
Bob Carter, head of U.S. sales for Toyota Motor Corp, said at a forum in New York last week that if tariffs are imposed ""quite frankly that's pulling the pin out of the grenade... I don't believe the U.S. economy can run out of the room fast enough if that happens.""

320,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>",U.S. expands air bag defect probe to 12.3 million vehicles,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday it is expanding a probe into potentially defective air bags to 12.3 million vehicles and upgrading it to an engineering analysis, a step required before it can seek to compel recalls.
The agency, known as NHTSA, said the air bags were installed in some vehicles from model years 2010 through 2019 sold by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp, Mitsubishi and Toyota Motor Corp.
They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen. The agency said they could fail during a crash.
NHTSA first opened a probe in 2018 of about 400,000 vehicles, and said Tuesday it has reports of two crashes and two injuries related to the defect along with one death in a Toyota vehicle.
ZF spokesman John Wilkerson said the company ""is committed to motor vehicle safety and is working cooperatively with NHTSA and our customers in the investigation.""
Toyota said it is ""cooperating with NHTSA’s engineering analysis. Toyota is also continuing its investigation into this issue and will take any appropriate action.""
At issue is whether the air bag control units may suffer electrical overstress due to harmful signals resulting from a crash, causing them to stop working during such an event. In opening its probe, NHTSA said ""the probability of this occurring appears to be low.""
NHTSA noted on Tuesday that there have recently been two substantial frontal crashes that may be tied to the issue, including the fatal Toyota crash. The agency is looking at whether an ""unreasonable risk exists that requires further field action.""
Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler have previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes.
When it recalled nearly 2 million vehicles for air bag nondeployments with the issue in 2016, Fiat Chrysler said it had reports of three deaths and five injuries that might be related to the defect.
In a statement on Tuesday, Fiat Chrysler said that ""when we became aware of this issue in 2016, we responded accordingly. However, we will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation.""

Hyundai and Kia recalled more than 650,000 vehicles for air bag nondeployment concerns in 2018.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Tuesday put the remnants of its WMC Mortgage unit into bankruptcy, 11 days after paying a $1.5 billion U.S. fine over defective subprime mortgages issued by WMC before the 2008 financial crisis.
The Chapter 11 filing affords ""finality"" for WMC, given its limited cash --$175,000-- and support from GE, and the threat of further claims, WMC Chief Executive Mark Asdourian said in a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware.
WMC was bought by General Electric's GE Capital unit in 2004, and originated more than $65 billion of mortgage loans from 2005 to 2007.
It halted originations in 2007 because of the collapse of the U.S. housing and financial markets. WMC sold most of its assets that December to DLJ Capital.
Tuesday's filing is part of GE's effort to address liabilities incurred through many years of expansion under prior management, while improving profitability and cash flow.
""This filing is another important step in the de-risking of GE Capital,"" a GE spokeswoman said in a statement about WMC's bankruptcy. ""GE and GE Capital are not part of the filing and the case has no adverse impact on our business operations.""
WMC said the bankruptcy would help it complete a $198 million settlement over its packaging in 2006 of 5,000 mortgage loans into securities sold to investors.
It said that would resolve the last of 14 lawsuits it faced over residential mortgage-backed securities, following $870 million of settlements of the other 13 lawsuits.
The $1.5 billion civil settlement on April 12 resolved U.S. Department of Justice claims that GE concealed the poor quality of WMC's loans and WMC's lax fraud controls. GE did not admit wrongdoing.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) on Tuesday raised its 2019 profit forecast and beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit as it focuses on cost cuts, but the U.S. wireless carrier lost more phone subscribers than analysts had expected.
Verizon said it now expects low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted profit, after previously saying that its 2019 profit would be similar to what it reported a year earlier.
Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said profit margins in the carrier's core wireless business was pressured by accounting changes during the first quarter. Without the items, ""the business performed really well,"" Ellis said in an interview.
Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, described the results as mixed, as Verizon's raised guidance seemed to be ""driven entirely by below-the-line items.""
Shares of Verizon were down 2.2 percent at $57.09 in morning trading.
The company said it lost a net 44,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the first quarter, which was characterized by few big price-cut promotions. Analysts had expected a net loss of 25,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
Verizon launched its 5G mobile network in two cities in the United States last month at an additional cost of $10 for customers with existing unlimited plans. It plans to spend $17 billion to $18 billion this year to build its network.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $5.03 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. 
On an adjusted basis, Verizon earned $1.20 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.17, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue for Verizon Media Group, which was formerly called Oath and includes the Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and AOL media brands, was $1.8 billion during the quarter, a decline from the previous year as the company earned less revenue from desktop advertising. 
The company lost a net 53,000 Fios video customers during the quarter, as viewers continue to shift to cheaper streaming services. Analysts had expected it to lose just 40,000 video customers, according to FactSet. 
Verizon said Tuesday it was partnering with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to bring YouTube TV, a live and on-demand video streaming service, to its customers.
Verizon added 52,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter.

Total operating revenue rose about 1 percent to $32.13 billion during the quarter, falling slightly short of analysts' estimates of $32.16 billion.

329,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Tesla’s Stock Just Went Fully Autonomous,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Steve Jobs was said to operate his own “reality distortion field,” persuading others to believe in the seemingly impossible. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s CEO, Elon Musk, has tapped into similar powers. But on Monday, when he hosted his company’s autonomy demonstration, reality remained stubbornly intact.
Musk, along with several senior managers, spent hours showcasing an area of technology, autonomous driving, where Tesla doesn’t enjoy quite the same pioneering reputation it has in vehicle electrification. Certainly, the first presentation – Peter Bannon, VP of silicon engineering, on the company’s “full self-driving,” or FSD, computer – seemed squarely aimed at establishing Tesla’s technical bona fides, even if it sometimes ran the risk of leaving non-geeks somewhat bewildered (sample line: “In this network, of the 35 billion operations, almost all of them are Convolution, which is based on dot product; the rest are Deconvolution, also based on dot product; and then ReLu and Pooling, which are relatively simple operations.”)
But the longer things wore on, the less credible it seemed. Bold claim followed bold claim. Lidar, the sensor technology favored by most other developers of autonomous vehicles, was declared “lame,” with Musk predicting his rivals would eventually wake up and ditch it or be “doomed.” Could he be right? Perhaps. But it’s a big ask to have us accept that everyone else working on this is just being stupid when Tesla has spent the past year or so struggling with the process of manufacturing and delivering cars.
The most interesting claims concerned robotaxis. The idea of Tesla owners being able to send their prized vehicles hither and yon autonomously to earn money offering rides has been around for a few years. Now Musk says there will be a million potential Tesla robotaxis on the road sometime in 2020, just waiting for a software update that will unleash their earning power, perhaps $30,000 apiece in annual gross profits.
I may well be lame, but I wonder if there really will be a million autonomous Teslas each earning an average gross margin of $30,000 as they ply the streets for business next year or maybe even the year after that. This is partly because, as Musk acknowledged himself on Monday, his guidance can be a little off when it comes to timing (see this). Back in October 2016, Tesla boasted in a blog post that “All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware,” which was essentially also the message from Monday’s show-and-tell.
I don’t appear to be alone either. Because if the market really bought the idea that Tesla had essentially mastered full self-driving almost to the point where a vehicle costing less than $40,000 had a net present value of, as Musk said, $200,000 due to its earnings power, there is no way Tesla’s stock would have gone down and stayed down on Monday.
Possibly, like me, investors were puzzled at the very idea of discounting a theoretical gross margin to come up with a net present value (a bit like looking at your pre-tax wages and shouting “woo-hoo!” Homer Simpson-style). They may also have wondered why a company would even sell a vehicle supposedly worth north of $200,000 for less than $40,000 in the first place, rather than just keeping it and running it themselves.
There was more. Asked how much money Tesla was spending on autonomous technology, Musk said it was essentially “the entire cost structure.” That’s just odd when you consider Tesla definitely spends money on production lines for existing vehicles, along with retail operations and its solar and battery businesses – and has been trying to slash those costs to the bone. 
Asked about financing, Musk indicated Tesla would be roughly cash-flow neutral while it was building out its autonomous fleet “around the world,” before becoming strongly cash-flow positive. What exactly “cash-flow neutral/positive” means at this point is up for debate. But only last October, Musk suggested Tesla could be “positive cash flow” in all quarters apart from those, like the last one, where it was repaying debt. Has that now been deferred until after the robofleet has been deployed in numbers in, ahem, 2020?
As of Tuesday morning’s pre-game, Tesla’s stock had slipped below $260, a level that has formed something of a floor for much of the past two years. Like the shrug that greeted the Model Y’s unveiling last month, this ambivalence in the face of apparently game-changing technology should trouble Tesla bulls.
To be clear, at 125 times estimated adjusted earnings for 2019 (GAAP is negative), the stock is still priced for a jet-pack future today. The halo effect of past achievements, such as the Model S, remains and there can be little doubt that Tesla’s products have loyal fans. But maybe too much has happened in the past year, from fanciful takeover deals to u-turn strategic shifts to a sudden drop in demand, for yet another declaration of intent to engender an instant rally. Real numbers, in the form of what are almost certainly bad first-quarter results, are imminent. Try to distort reality too much, and eventually you merely reinforce it."

(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) reported a better-than-expected 47 percent jump in quarterly profit on Tuesday and raised its annual profit forecast, helped by strong demand for its missiles and fighter jets, sending its shares up 6 percent.
The Pentagon's biggest weapons supplier is the first major defense company to report first-quarter earnings this week, which Wall Street generally expects to be higher than a year ago as the industry benefits from increased U.S. defense spending and global demand for jets and munitions. 
Its results sent the whole sector higher, with  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) shares all up more than 2 percent.
Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control business, which makes missile defenses like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), was one of its best-performing units.
On April 1, the unit was awarded a THAAD interceptor missile contract worth $2.4 billion, some of which are slated to be delivered to Saudi Arabia, which could boost earnings for the current quarter.
Overall, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company said its earnings rose to $1.70 billion, or $5.99 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.16 billion, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier. That was partly helped by a $75 million dollar boost from additional tax deductions on foreign military sales.
Excluding that one-time gain, Lockheed reported $5.73 per share profit, well ahead of the $4.34 per share that Wall Street had expected, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Lockheed's overall net sales for the quarter rose 23 percent to $14.34 billion. The company's sales backlog grew to $133.5 billion, up 3 billion over the quarter.
Lockheed shares were up 5.8 percent at $333.85 in early trading.

Operating margins at the aeronautics division, Lockheed's biggest, fell to 10.5 percent in the first quarter from 10.8 percent a year earlier, but sales were up 27 percent to $5.5 billion on demand for the F-35 jet and some classified contracts.
The United States is considering expanding sales of Lockheed-made F-35 fighter jets to five new nations including Romania, Greece and Poland as European allies bulk up their defenses in the face of a strengthening Russia, a Pentagon official told Congress in early April.
The F-35, a key program for Lockheed, suffered a setback earlier this month when a Japanese F-35 stealth fighter crashed in the Pacific Ocean close to northern Japan. The aircraft was less than a year old and was the first F-35 assembled in Japan.
The company highlighted some risks in its earnings report, including U.S. ""government actions to prevent the sale or delivery of the corporation's products"" to Turkey.
The U.S. Congress recently introduced several bipartisan resolutions targeting Turkey, calling on President Donald Trump's administration to impose sanctions or prohibit the transfer of F-35 fighter aircraft.

At issue is Ankara's unwillingness to reverse a decision to purchase a Russian-made missile defense system, forcing the United States to explore a future for the F-35 program without Turkey, which makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays.

334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 09:55AM ET</span>",S&P 500's Path to Record Goes Through Favorable Tech Setup,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 is oh-so-close to its all-time high. The key for it to reach uncharted territory may be 2019’s star performer: Technology stocks.
Information Technology stocks in the S&P 500 have advanced 26 percent in 2019, versus the next-closest group -- Industrials -- at 21 percent. The broad index is up 16 percent, and as of April 22 was within a percent of its record close last September of 2,930.75. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 and Philadelphia Stock Semiconductor Index have already risen to records.
Investors Get Greedy in Nasdaq as Tech-Heavy Gauge Hits Record
“Big Tech has broken out to a new all-time high and remains in an outstanding position to propel the S&P to a new all-time high above 2,940 and first-half run at 3,000,” Evercore ISI technical strategist Rich Ross wrote in an April 22 note. He said favorable setups for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. “give you over $4 trillion reasons to keep buying tech and stocks more broadly.”
The Nasdaq-100’s record bodes well for further gains in both that gauge and the S&P 500, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. Founder Jason Goepfert.
When the Nasdaq-100 reaches its first new high in at least 100 days and exceeds the multiyear high by more than 0.5 percent, it tends to keep going, Goepfert said. In 13 of 14 cases, the gauge was positive one month after such a trigger -- and the same count was true after one year.
Such breakouts were even more positive for the S&P 500, Goepfert said, as results were largely positive and had a highly favorable risk/reward, “with the median draw down over the next six months being barely -1 percent, while reward neared +9 percent.”
The highs in the tech sector come just as earnings season -- or as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategist Mike Wilson called it a couple weeks ago, “the moment of truth” -- is poised to ramp up. Microsoft, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon are all set to report this week, three of about 150 S&P 500 components scheduled to do so.
“Earnings will be a key test for the market and we believe beat-and-raise results are required to justify current valuations,” Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig W. Johnson wrote in a note April 22. He added that the charts look attractive for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and  STMicroelectronics NV  (NYSE:STM)
But Evercore’s Ross says the Nasdaq-100 exchange-traded fund’s breakout to new highs “has legs” and Sundial’s Goepfert sees at least some aspects of the rally to like, as well.
“The most bullish aspects about this market aren’t fundamental, and they’re most certainly not sentiment-related” given that confidence of “dumb-money” investors is so high, Goepfert said. “But price action has been pristine and it’s been hard to fight that kind of action.”

336,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 09:40AM ET</span>",Italy's fiscal dispute with EU might resume after debt exceeds forecasts,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Public debt in Greece and Italy, the two most indebted countries in the euro zone, grew last year while the bloc as a whole saw its liabilities decrease, the European Union statistics office said on Tuesday.
Rome's growing debt, which is also higher than Brussels had predicted, is seen as further stretching EU fiscal rules that require countries with high debts to gradually bring them down. 
Italy, whose eurosceptic government adopted free-spending policies last year that have so far had little impact on growth, had debt equivalent to 132.2 percent of national output in 2018, or 2.3 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion), up from 131.4 percent in the previous year, Eurostat said.
Up to 0.2 percent of the Italian debt was due to derivative contracts, which are usually used to hedge against risks but triggered losses for 4.7 billion euros in 2018, Eurostat data show. Other euro zone countries have reduced their debt thanks to derivatives.
Although Rome has decreased its losses on derivatives from the 5.4 billion euros posted in 2017, the negative impact over the country's debt has exceeded 25 billion since 2015, data show. 
The European Commission, which monitors euro zone states' budgets, refrained in December from starting disciplinary steps against Italy over its growing debt. 
It predicted then that Italian debt would be 131.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2018 -- lower than Tuesday's data showed.
The Commission has said it will reassess Rome's compliance with EU fiscal rules, including the requirement to cut debt, in June, taking into account the final debt data from Eurostat.
A spokeswoman for the EU executive declined to comment on the new figures released by Eurostat. 
She said Brussels' new evaluation of Italy's position will also be based on new forecasts due in May of debt developments, and on Italy's report on its fiscal plans for the next three years which Rome had just submitted.
Italy's 10-year government bond yield jumped to its highest in seven weeks on Tuesday, pushed up mostly by unease over government infighting and an upcoming ratings review.
BUCKING THE TREND
Italy bucked the euro zone trend, as overall debt in the 19-country currency bloc fell to 85.1 percent of GDP last year from 87.1 percent in 2017, Eurostat said.
The bloc's aggregated budget deficit also dropped to 0.5 percent of GDP from 1.0 percent in 2017.
The fall coincided with Germany's reduction of its debt to 60.9 percent of GDP, from 64.5 percent in 2017. The bloc's largest economy also widened its public surplus to 1.7 percent of output from 1.0 percent in 2017.
In Greece, debt climbed to 181.1 percent of GDP in 2018, the largest ratio in the euro zone. 
The increase from 176.2 percent in 2017 was mostly due to the last installment of euro zone creditors' loans as part of the country's third bailout program which ended last summer.
The recent exit from the bailout program exempts Greece from the normal application of EU rules that require countries with public debt above the 60 percent of GDP threshold allowed by EU law to cut the excess by 5 percent a year.
Cyprus, another of the bloc's most indebted countries, saw its debt rise to 102.5 percent of GDP from 95.8 percent.
Portugal, which was also bailed out during the euro zone's debt crisis, saw its debt fall to 121.5 percent of output from 124.8 percent, while Belgium's debt declined to 102.0 percent of GDP last year from 103.4 percent in 2017. 
French public debt was stable at 98.4 percent of output, while the country's budget deficit dropped to 2.5 percent of GDP from 2.8 percent in 2017.

339,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",EU watchdogs give banks no leeway on Brexit-driven hub demands,"By Huw Jones, Sinead Cruise and Francesco Canepa
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Union regulators are refusing to cut British-based banks any slack over bulking up in the bloc in preparation for Brexit, despite an extension to the process which some have taken as an opportunity to drag their feet.
Cost-conscious banks are reluctant to spend millions more and cause further disruption to already unsettled staff given uncertainty over how and when Britain will leave the EU.
""Businesses are trying to be savvy, to meet the minimum legal requirement and figure the rest out after Brexit,"" Hakan Enver, managing director for financial services at recruiter Morgan McKinley told Reuters.
Banks are trying to minimize staff moves despite pressure from the European Central Bank (ECB), which set a proviso to granting licenses that firms would beef up their EU units with more employees and assets over the next one to two years.
This requirement has not changed, a source close to the matter said, even though the EU has given Britain until Oct. 31 to leave, an extension from the original ""Brexit Day"" of March 29. 
""Banks are still expected to stick to the timeline agreed with the ECB,"" the source said.
Dozens of banks have already set up new bases in the EU to avoid disrupting services to clients. Regulators issued licenses for them, even though they are thinly staffed, so that they could be operational when Britain was meant to quit the EU. 
HSBC, which declined to comment, shifted some staff from London to its Paris subsidiary in case of a no-deal Brexit on April 12, only to recall them when a new delay was agreed.
And a source at a major U.S. bank said it had dozens of staff lined up to move if there was a no-deal Brexit, but stood them down and is now awaiting clarity before any further moves.
""We are inclined to say that while we remain in this holding pattern, we don't have to move anyone or anything,"" the source said, adding that Brexit could yet be scrapped completely.
The Bank of England expects about 4,000 banking and insurance jobs will have moved from London to new EU hubs by Brexit Day, but recruiters and banking sources say the number that have moved so far is much lower than that. 
Some banks were behind with plans to be operationally ready and are now using the delay to complete moves of customer accounts to new hubs, a senior official at a global bank said.
Meanwhile, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority's has warned financial firms sending staff to new EU hubs to ensure they still have ""appropriate senior oversight"" of their operations left behind in Britain.
BACK-TO-BACK 
Banks have so far moved around a trillion euros in stocks, bonds, derivatives contracts and other assets from London to their new EU hubs. Accounts of EU clients must also be moved to conduct business from these hubs, a process known as repapering.
But there is still a long tail of small customers for whom repapering is a burdensome task of changing IT and controls systems, limiting how much business new hubs can take on despite regulatory pressure to move in to higher gear.
""Nobody is yet really doing any substantive business, but there will be a robust dialogue between banks and regulators about when to transfer substantive amounts of business and client preferences will play a big role,"" said Vishal Vedi, lead financial services Brexit partner at Deloitte.
EU regulators gave temporary concessions to banks to obtain a license, such as continuing to book some trades in London, but their tolerance is waning. 
""We expect some back-to-back (trading) to continue, though new hubs in Frankfurt will have to show the ECB that they can stand on their own two feet if need be,"" a senior banking regulator told Reuters.
Having to build up capital in a new unit is expensive for banks at a time of a slowdown in European investment banking.
European M&A was down 67 percent in the first quarter of the year, while first quarter results due out over the next few weeks are expected to show trading volumes at European investment banks were down 15 to 20 percent.

""The longer the extension period, the longer it will be problematic for firms,"" Andrew Gray, head of UK financial services at PwC, said.

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) surged past expectations for first-quarter profit on Tuesday and drew a change of tack from U.S. President Donald Trump, who vowed to protect the motorcycle maker from European tariffs, driving its shares up 3 percent.
Trump had previously criticized Harley for its plans to shift some U.S. production overseas to avoid European Union duties imposed in retaliation for the tariffs the White House placed on imported steel and aluminum last year.
But ahead of a speech on Saturday in Wisconsin, where Harley is based, the president said on Twitter that the bloc's treatment of the company had been ""unfair"" and vowed to reciprocate.
""The shares have rallied (we think) in anticipation of potential tariff relief ... we remain cautious in our outlook for the U.S. motorcycle industry, and continue to rate the shares Hold,"" Stifel analyst Drew Crum said.
The costs of Trump's trade wars have only added to the troubles of the world's most iconic motorcycle brand, which has struggled to attract younger fans as its core customers won in the rebel heyday of the 1960s and 70s grow older.
Earlier this year, Harley said the retaliatory import duties imposed by the European Union on its bikes would cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019.
EU tariffs on U.S.-manufactured motorcycles, which increased from to 31 percent from 6 percent last June, are set to rise to 56 percent in 2021.
Similarly, China's tariffs on the bikes exported from the U.S. have increased to 55 percent from 30 percent as a result of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
The company topped expectations for first quarter profit by more than 30 cents per share and stuck to shipment forecasts for the whole of 2019, which some analysts had expected to be cut.
Overall sales, however, continued to fall. U.S. retail motorcycle sales, or sales by dealers to customers, fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter ended March. 31. European sales were down 2.1 percent.
The company's overall net income fell 26.7 percent to $127.9 million in the quarter, while revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 12.3 percent to $1.19 billion, roughly in line with forecasts.

That generated earnings per share, excluding items, of 98 cents, compared with the average analyst estimate of 65 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""We enforce the Twitter Rules dispassionately and equally for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts,"" a Twitter representative said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's comments came the same day Twitter reported its first-quarter results. 

Twitter's quarterly revenue topped analyst expectations. It also reported a surprise rise in monthly active users, suggesting that its efforts to delete spam accounts and to police posts better were working to help attract more users and ad dollars.

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by robust demand for aircraft parts at one of the producers better placed to ride out the fallout of this year's Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX groundings.
The company's shares were up 4 percent at $142.50 in early trading, after it raised the low end of its 2019 forecast for adjusted earnings per share by 10 cents to $7.80, while keeping the upper end unchanged at $8.00.
UTC, whose stock has risen 10 percent since the fatal crash in Ethiopia in March, said it is benefiting from better-than-expected performance of its recently acquired aero parts maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL).
Shares of aerospace suppliers have been under pressure following the second deadly crash of a  Boeing Co  737 MAX jet within five months, grounding the planes and forcing Boeing to cut production of its best-selling jets.
UTC's stock, however, has outperformed a 0.2 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index, due to the aerospace supplier's small exposure to the 737 MAX jets.
Sales in the unit which houses Rockwell Collins and is the company's biggest, jumped about 71 percent to $6.51 billion, as a growing fleet of aircraft boosts demand for spare parts.
Rockwell Collins, now combined with UTC's aerospace systems, makes engine components, interior and exterior aircraft lighting, aircraft seating, landing gear, wheels and brakes, and provides spare parts, overhaul and repair services.
""We made significant progress this quarter on the integration of Rockwell Collins and saw excellent performance from the combined Collins Aerospace business,"" Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said.
UTC, which also makes Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners, said it was on track to separate into three companies in the first half of 2020, leaving the company focused on its aerospace units through Collins Aerospace and the Pratt & Whitney engines business.
On an adjusted basis, UTC earned $1.91 per share in the first quarter ended March 31, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.71 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company said net sales rose 20.5 percent to $18.37 billion, and were above estimates of $17.99 billion.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",UK watchdog urges EU to make financial market access flexible,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's system of financial-market access needs adapting to avoid disputes between the EU and Britain over rules after Brexit, a top UK regulator said on Tuesday.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said future regulation in Britain will hinge on where the EU system of ""equivalence"" leads to.
Equivalence refers to Brussels granting foreign banks direct access to customers in the EU if it determines that their home rules are similar enough to those in the EU.
But for this to work after Brexit, it needs a ""rules of the game"" agreement setting out how equivalence is determined and a mechanism for handling disputes, Bailey said.
Equivalence should be based on whether the outcomes of foreign and EU regulation are the same, rather than on actual rules being written in the same way, Baile said.
Focusing on outcomes was critical, since Britain has a history of common law and preference for broad principles, while the EU has moved to harmonized rules, Bailey said.
""Left to our own devices, I think the UK regulatory system would evolve somewhat differently,"" Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.
The EU has said that equivalence was the most likely form of market access for Britain's financial sector to the EU, its most important customer.
Critics say the system is patchy, unpredictable and access can be withdrawn at short notice, citing the four years it took for the Europe and the United States to agree on clearing rules. 
""We need to be careful here because I would submit that the record to date indicates that all of us are good at talking the language of outcomes but practicing the world of rules,"" Bailey said in a speech at Bloomberg.
Britain's government has called for ""enhanced"" equivalence to avoid the UK becoming a ""rule taker"" or continually copying EU law, but Brussels has shown little appetite for radically overhauling its system.
Faced with a major foreign financial center on its doorstep after Brexit, the EU has instead tightened access for foreign clearing houses and investment firms.
Banks, insurers and fund managers in Britain have opted to play safe and open new EU hubs.
Britain has introduced equivalence along with all EU financial rules into national law as part of its Brexit preparations.
The FCA is already fending off pressure for a tit-for-tat response to moves by EU regulators to ban trading of thousands of shares outside the bloc - including leading UK stocks - if there is a no-deal Brexit.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 08:56AM ET</span>",Airbus management shake-up spreads to space unit,"PARIS (Reuters) - A management shake-up at Europe's Airbus accelerated on Tuesday as Nicolas Chamussy was replaced as the head of Space Systems.
Airbus said the 51-year-old space engineer would have an unspecified future role, while his job as head of space activities including the company's 50 percent share of the ArianeGroup rocket venture will be taken by Jean-Marc Nasr.
The move comes less than four months after Nasr, 57, was named head of Asia-Pacific, responsible for group strategy and industrial issues and regional sales for Airbus Defence & Space.
Chamussy is a former chief of staff to Tom Enders, who stepped down earlier this month to make way for planemaking chief Guillaume Faury, and has been facing mounting competition from a new breed of private U.S. and other space contractors.
Companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX, LeoSat Enterprises, and Canada's Telesat are working to enable data networks with hundreds or even thousands of tiny satellites that orbit closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites, a radical shift made possible by leaps in laser technology and computer chips.
Faury, 51, has implemented a tighter structure designed to simplify Europe's largest aerospace group, while sidelining a number of executives previously close to Enders or former planemaking boss Fabrice Bregier, according to company watchers.
La Tribune, which first reported the changeover at space systems, said the reorganization could lead to other departures, accelerating a sweeping management overhaul already driven partly by an ongoing corruption probe and scheduled retirements.
An Airbus spokesman said Chamussy would stay inside Airbus and declined further comment on management changes.
The Space Systems division makes up 27 percent of Airbus Defence & Space revenues, which grew 4.4 percent last year to 11.1 billion euros ($12.5 billion). Space spending is rising but established players face increase competition within the United States, China, Japan and India.
Airbus is seeking to shore up its position by prioritizing a fledgling market for constellations of tiny satellites designed to broaden internet access and support new services. It launched six mini-satellites in February, the first of at least 600 to be launched in the next two to three years together with partner OneWeb.

The company has been bolstering its portfolio of non-carbonated drinks such as coffee, flavored waters and smoothies under Chief Executive Officer James Quincy who is spearheading Coca-Cola's transformation into a ""total beverage company"".
As part of the plan, Coca-Cola paid $5.1 billion for Costa Coffee earlier this year to tap into a booming global coffee market.
The company has also been testing new flavors of its trademark colas after the success of cherry- and vanilla-flavored drinks. It launched an orange-vanilla version of its Coca-Cola soda earlier this year, its first new Coke flavor in over a decade.
Quincy is also focusing on margins over volumes by divesting its bottling operations, while tweaking package sizes and raising prices. The slimmer cans and bottles helped drive a 6 percent rise in sales of waters and sports drinks.
New low-sugar recipes and smaller packages are helping both Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc reverse years of declines in soda sales. 
Coke's organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency swings and acquisitions, rose 6 percent, driven by price hikes and partly benefiting from bottlers stocking up more products due to Brexit uncertainty. 
""We are impressed with Coca-Cola's ability to deliver a strong topline, suggesting that its refranchising (and) portfolio transformation are paying off,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
For the second quarter, the company projected a 6 percent boost in comparable revenue from acquisitions and divestitures, but continues to see an impact from currency swings. It maintained its forecast for the full year. 
Revenue rose 5 percent to $8.02 billion, and the company earned 48 cents per share on an adjusted basis. 
Analysts had forecast earnings of 46 cents per share on revenue of $7.88 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 

Net income attributable to the company rose 22.6 percent to $1.68 billion.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Fund manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) will not support Bayer's management in a key vote at its annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) has been wiped off the German drugmaker's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer (DE:BAYGN) liable because  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which it bought for $63 billion last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup.
Bayer suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 11,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.
BlackRock, which latest filings show owns 7.2 percent of Bayer's voting rights, plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board's actions during the year under review, the sources said.
The largely symbolic vote of confidence ""will send a message to the board"" that BlackRock is not happy with the way Bayer's management handled the Monsanto deal, one of the sources said.
A vote to ratify the board's actions features prominently at every German AGM. It has no bearing on management's liability, but is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment.

Bayer's next two biggest shareholders, Singapore state investor Temasek and Norway's oil fund, both declined to comment on their AGM voting intentions when contacted by Reuters.

Nissan said Daniele Schillaci, an executive vice- president who had been responsible for the three brands and for all operations in the Japan, Asia and Oceania regions, had chosen to leave the company to pursue an opportunity closer to his native home in Europe.
Nissan also said it had named executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi as chief operating officer to strengthen daily operations. 
It appointed an executive dedicated to performance recovery efforts and added executives overseeing major markets such as Japan, North America and China to the its executive committee.
Such changes, it said, were based on recommendations from an outside governance panel that it received last month. The external committee last month concluded a three-month audit of Nissan's governance and put blame squarely on what it called Ghosn's concentration of power.
Ghosn, who has been arrested on charges of financial misconduct, has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup by those who opposed his drive for a closer alliance with top shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
A representative for Ghosn has previously said the committee's findings were ""part of an unsubstantiated smear campaign against Carlos Ghosn to prevent the integration of the alliance and conceal Nissan's deteriorating performance"".

“So unfair to U.S. We will Reciprocate!” Trump said Tuesday on Twitter in a post that quoted Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo.
Harley-Davidson reported slumping first-quarter profit Tuesday, though it beat analysts’ expectations.
Harley is moving some U.S. production overseas to sidestep EU tariffs that jumped to 31 percent from 6 percent after Trump hiked levies on steel and aluminum imports.
The company’s move sparked the ire of Trump, who said he’d back a boycott of the company’s bikes. Tariffs will cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019, executives said in January.
Trump is scheduled to hold a political rally in Harley’s home state of Wisconsin later this week. He said on Twitter the rally will be held Saturday night in Green Bay.

The Wisconsin-based company last year announced plans to move production of its motorcycles destined for the European Union to its overseas facilities from the United States to avoid EU tariffs imposed in response to Trump's duties on steel and aluminum imports.
Trump retaliated by calling for higher taxes, threatening to lure foreign motorcycles to the United States, and backing a boycott of the iconic American motorcycle maker. 
On Tuesday, Trump appeared more sympathetic, calling the EU tariffs ""unfair"" but giving no other details about any planned U.S. action in a tweet citing comments by a Fox Business Network host.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 07:45AM ET</span>",German prosecutors probe bonus payments to suspended VW manager,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors are investigating a possible breach of fiduciary duty by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) over bonus payments made to an executive who was suspended over the carmaker's emissions cheating scandal.
Regulators blew the whistle on Volkswagen (VW) in 2015 after the German company was caught using software designed to cheat emissions tests on diesel engines. 
VW has argued the cheating was the work of a handful of engineers who acted without the consent or knowledge of members of the management board, which at the time included VW's current chief executive Herbert Diess and chairman Hans-Dieter Poetsch.
Prosecutors in Braunschweig, in VW's home region of Lower Saxony, said on Tuesday they were now investigating why one VW manager received bonus payments while suspended. According to German paper Bild am Sonntag, the manager received 866,000 euros ($974,000) in bonuses between 2016 and 2018.
The prosecutors declined to identify the manager. 
VW declined to comment on the payments. 
The manager is among five VW executives, including former chief executive Martin Winterkorn, to face criminal charges for conspiring to cover up the carmaker's diesel emissions cheating scandal.
Prosecutors have said that between November 2006 and September 2015, Winterkorn and four other managers failed in their duty to inform authorities about systematic emissions cheating. The VW managers could face up to 10 years in prison.
The carmaker has argued that although it was informed about the use of software to help pass emissions tests, lawyers advising the company had cautioned against informing the authorities because it was unclear the software was illegal. 
Regulators later said that VW had crossed the line from using legitimate software programs to protect engines from damage, known as Auxiliary Emission Control Devices (AECD), to using an illegal “defeat device” which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as software which “reduced the effectiveness of the emission control system."" 
VW has said it also stopped short of informing shareholders about the software before the regulatory announcement because it felt potential fines would not exceed 150 million euros. So far the scandal has cost VW more than 29 billion euros.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Game of thrones: Board battle at toilet maker Lixil a test for Japan Inc,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - A simmering boardroom battle at toilet maker Lixil Group has emerged as a test case for whether minority shareholders can improve corporate governance in Japan, the man at the center of the tussle told Reuters.
Kinya Seto, whose abrupt resignation as Lixil's CEO in 2018 prompted a revolt by minority shareholders, said the company is controlled by an old guard of management ""kingmakers"" who prioritize their interests over shareholders'.
""In Japan even fairly big companies have these kingmakers who are in power for a decade or two and even the chief executive can't oppose them,"" Seto said.
""Their opinions do not necessarily represent shareholders' opinions. Companies may prioritize kingmakers' opinions and as a result Japanese companies do not function properly."" 
The current CEO and chairman of Lixil's board, Yoichiro Ushioda, hails from one of the company's founding families. His prompt appointment after Seto's departure had raised concerns about corporate governance and led to calls for him to resign.
Ushioda bowed to investor pressure and said last week he would step down in May - but not before publicly putting the blame on Seto for Lixil's bleak financial performance.
Activist investors have been gaining momentum in Japan and have complained about what they see as poor performance as well as returns from cash-hoarding firms, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe advocating strengthening corporate governance.
But companies are often able to ignore minority investors given the longstanding practice of cross-shareholding, where firms hold stakes in each other to cement business ties.
""If the governance of Japanese companies changes, then corporate management will improve,"" said Seto, who remains a director at Lixil and is seeking to take back the CEO post.
He and another director have said they will propose a new slate of board members. 
""I need to win. If I fail, that becomes a bad example of Japanese corporate governance,"" Seto told Reuters this week.
KINGMAKER
Lixil was created in 2011 through a merger of five Japanese building materials and housing firms, including Tostem and Inax. It is well known in Japan for its high-tech, luxury toilets, while its overseas brands include American Standard and Grohe.
It has been roiled by the boardroom drama, which has been unusually fractious by the standards of corporate Japan, since Seto's resignation in October.
According to a report from a group of independent lawyers commissioned by Lixil, Ushioda last year ""engaged in behavior giving the false impression that Mr Seto had a concrete and clear intention to resign as CEO"".
The February report also cites a company director as saying: ""No one could object to Mr. Ushioda, a member of a founding family, saying he will become CEO"". 
Ushioda, when announcing his resignation, said he was doing so to take responsibility for previously appointing Seto. 
""The appointment of Seto as CEO was my biggest mistake,"" Ushioda told a news conference, saying Seto was responsible for the loss at Lixil's Italian subsidiary, which forced the company to warn of a full-year net loss.
Seto, in turn, has accused Ushioda of being a ""kingmaker"" who wields power from the sidelines of companies and ultimately damages them. Ushioda's willingness to stay on as adviser points to his desire to hold sway over the company, Seto added.
A Lixil spokesman, however, pointed out that Ushioda had said he would resign from the board and management.
""Lixil has been and will try to strengthen corporate governance in order to boost corporate value sustainably.""

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as battery maker Umicore kicked off a busy week of earnings with a grim outlook and investors grew concerned about China cutting additional support to its economy, but a rally in oil and gas stocks helped temper losses. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3 percent by 0930 GMT after seven straight sessions of gains, with all major indices in the red except oil major-heavy London's FTSE 100 which rose 0.4 percent. 
Earnings started to roll in on a not-so-positive note with Umicore tumbling 16 percent, after the Belgian group warned revenue and earnings growth in 2020 will be lower than previous indications due to delays in the electric vehicle and energy storage markets.
Umicore's slide weighed heavily on Belgium's blue chip Bel 20 Index, pulling it 1.5 percent lower.
Car part suppliers Plastic Omnium and Faurecia also reported first quarter results. Plastic Omnium slid after warning of a decline in worldwide auto production, but Faurecia rose 1.5 percent after the company met its full-year target. 
Belgium's Melexis, which supplies semiconductor solutions for cars, slipped 6 percent after first quarter net income tumbled. 
""We're pausing for breadth ahead of a fairly busy week of earnings after a decent winning streak,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group in London.
The banking index eased from six-month highs with major European banks as UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) slated to report earnings late this week after last week's mixed bag of results from big Wall Street banks. 
""We've seen the likes of record profits from J.P. Morgan but nothing close in Europe. The numbers aren't going to be great,"" said Lawler. 
Earnings numbers from some of the biggest S&P 500 companies, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), are also due this week. 
Payments company Wirecard was among the biggest decliners after Germany's markets regulator Bafin's two-month ban on short-selling ended on Friday. 
Ahold Delhaize slid after the Dutch supermarket warned that a strike at its Stop & Shop chain in U.S. would hurt its underlying 2019 profit margin, as it missed out on around $200 million on Easter week sales.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) fell 1.4 percent after Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it would reject a management integration proposal from its French partner and called for an equal capital relationship, according to a Nikkei report.
Also weighing on sentiment was Beijing's indication to tone down its stimulus measures following unexpected signs of recovery from first-quarter economic data last week. 
CRUDE LIFT 
The oil and gas sector was among the lone bright spots with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), British Petroleum and Total, up between 1.7 percent and 2 percent. 
Oil prices were at 2019 highs on Tuesday after Washington announced all Iran sanction waivers would end by May, pressuring importers, mostly Asian, to stop buying from Tehran.
Surging oil prices, however, took a toll on airline stocks. Air France, EasyJet plc, Lufthansa and Ryanair , all shed between 2 percent and 4 percent.
Getinge was the top performer on the STOXX 600 after the Swedish medical technology company beat first quarter sales estimates and said restructuring measures will boost profit in the second half of the year. 
Thomas Cook jumped 14 percent after a Sky News report that the world's oldest tour operator was tentatively approached by several parties regarding a takeover of its tour operating division or the entire company.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped to near six-month highs on Tuesday as the United States tightened sanctions on Iran, sending shares of energy companies higher but largely failing to help the currencies of the main crude-oil producers. 
News that the U.S. had told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions pushed Brent toward $75 a barrel and made for a lively return from the four-day Easter break for Europe's markets. [O/R]
Oil and gas shares jumped more than 1.7 percent for their best start in six weeks, though almost every other sector suffered. So did bonds, as higher energy costs hung over profits and nudged up inflation expectations. [.EU][GVD/EUR]
Foreign-exchange market volatility was still largely absent. The dollar held near a three-week high, but the usual beneficiaries of higher oil prices, the Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown, dipped to $1.33 and $8.52 respectively. [/FRX]
""Oil is interesting, but the interesting thing for FX is that we are not getting the usual feed-through in the petrocurrencies,"" said Saxo bank's head of FX strategy, John Hardy, adding that might be caused by questions about Chinese stimulus. 
Both the Canadian dollar and the crown had gained on Monday, and the Russian rouble, another petrocurrency, hit its highest against the euro in more than a year its highest against the dollar in a month.
Overnight, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ended 0.1 percent higher and Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.2 percent. Oil and gas gains were offset by losses for airlines and other transport shares facing higher fuel costs. 
The White House said after its Iran move it was working with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure oil markets were ""adequately supplied,"" but traders had already been worried about tight supplies.
Oil prices are up nearly 50 percent since late December, and before the re-imposition of sanctions last year Iran was the fourth-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, at around 3 million barrels per day.
Oil prices are ""not so high that it crushes manufacturing by putting energy-price inputs up, but it is producing a nice boost to oil-producing nations,"" said Robert Carnell, Singapore-based chief economist and head of research for Asia Pacific at ING.
Carnell sees Brent crude's sweet spot at between $65 and $75 per barrel: ""Above this, you may see some negative impact.""
SRI LANKA
Sri Lanka's stock market and government bonds both fell as trading resumed after bombings had killed more than 300 people on Sunday. Tourism is likely to collapse, which would deal a serious blow to the island's economy and financial markets.
The International Monetary Fund last month extended a $1.5 billion loan to Sri Lanka into 2020, a key step in keeping foreign investors involved in what so far this year has been a top-performing frontier debt market.
In China, major benchmarks dipped in and out of negative territory amid concern that Beijing will slow the pace of policy easing after unexpectedly strong first-quarter economic data last week.
China's blue-chip stocks have surged over 30 percent so far this year on expectations of more stimulus and hopes Beijing and Washington will reach an agreement to end their nine-month trade dispute.

""We've had a fantastic run in Chinese equities year-to-date. Some profit taking is completely normal. I don't think China is changing its policy that quickly,"" said Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist at LGT Bank Asia in Hong Kong.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",Samsung retrieving all Galaxy Fold samples after defect reports: source,"By Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) is retrieving all Galaxy Fold samples distributed to reviewers, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, as the firm smarts from the reputational blow of postponing the launch of its first foldable smartphone.
The South Korean tech giant met with embarrassment ahead of the device's U.S. release on April 26, with a handful of technology journalists reporting breaks, bulges and blinking screens after just a day's use.
However, the setback for the $1,980 niche device is trivial compared to the Galaxy Note 7 debacle of 2016, when exploding batteries forced Samsung to scrap the flagship model at huge cost. Galaxy Fold shipments this year are likely to make up less than half a percent of Samsung's annual total, analysts and investors said.
Samsung postponed the Galaxy Fold's launch for an unspecified period of time while it investigated the damage reports, it said on Monday. Initial findings into the causes, it said, pointed to impact on exposed areas of the screen's hinges.
A representative declined to comment further on Tuesday.
Though the issue does not hurt Samsung's balance sheet, the postponement damages the firm's effort to showcase itself as an innovative first mover, not a fast follower, analysts said.
Daiwa Capital Markets said it saw little impact on Samsung's earnings, but that the issue is likely to have a bigger impact on supply-chain companies which rely on the tech giant.
Reflecting that sentiment, Samsung's share ended 0.3 percent lower versus 0.2 percent gain of the broader market. Parts suppliers, however, suffered steeper declines, with hinge maker KH Vatec Co Ltd shedding 3 percent.
A person with direct knowledge of the supply chain said KH Vatec conducted an internal review of hinges used in the Galaxy Fold and found no defects. The supplier declined to comment.
In March, Samsung released a video showing robots folding Galaxy Fold handsets 200,000 times for its durability test.
In some cases, reviewers had peeled off a layer of film which they mistook for a disposable screen protector.
""It's disastrous that Samsung sent samples to reviewers without clear instructions on how to handle the device,"" said analyst Kim Young-woo at SK Securities.
Samsung planned to sell 1 million Galaxy Fold handsets this year, the equivalent of less than half a percent of the 291.3 million smartphones it sold in 2018. Of last year's the total, 12.8 million were Note series phones, one estimate showed.
""On the bright side, we have an opportunity to nail down this issue and fix it before selling the phones to a massive audience, so they won't have same complaints,"" said a Samsung employee, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Samsung emailed pre-order customers upon delaying the launch, online outlets said on Twitter.

""Your pre-order guarantees your place in the queue for this innovative technology,"" Samsung said in the email. ""We'll update you with more specific shipping information in two weeks.""

Ahold said an 11-day strike that ended on Monday would lead to a one-time reduction in underlying operating profit of around $100 million due to lost sales and inventory.
""As a consequence, Ahold Delhaize now anticipates underlying operating margin for the group for 2019 to be slightly lower than 2018,"" it said.
""Additionally, the percentage growth of underlying earnings per share in 2019 is revised from high single digits to low single digits.""
Shares fell 4.5 percent to 21.04 euros by 0732 GMT in Amsterdam.
The strike involved 30,000 workers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Ahold said all would receive better pay, and those eligible would receive continued health insurance and pension benefits.
Ahold kept its full-year free cash flow estimates unchanged at 1.8 billion euros ($2.02 billion), due to expected growth at its other chains in the United States and Europe.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 03:37AM ET</span>","Exclusive: British Telecom's Italian job had London roots, say investigators","By Emilio Parodi
MILAN (Reuters) - A criminal investigation into accounting fraud inside British Telecom's Italian unit has uncovered more evidence of what prosecutors say was the involvement of senior executives in artificially inflating the division’s financial performance.
Emails seized by the police and reviewed by Reuters show for the first time why Italian prosecutors allege that top BT employees were at the heart of the problem, contrary to the company's assertions that managers at head office knew nothing about the misconduct.
""A series of emails between the top financial executives of BT Plc and managers of the (Italian) unit point to the existence of 'insistent' requests by the leadership of the parent company aimed at achieving ambitious economic targets, even using aggressive, anomalous and knowingly wrong accounting practices,"" Italy’s financial police said in a 353-page report.
The report has not been made public and its contents have not previously been reported.
The report contains emails from Brian More O’Ferrall, currently finance director at BT Wholesale, the company’s business-to-business division, in which he asks colleagues in Italy to find ways of adjusting their accounts to boost profits.
At the time, O’Ferrall was chief financial officer (CFO) for BT Europe, the European part of Global Services, one of the company’s biggest businesses.
O’Ferrall did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. BT declined to make O’Ferrall or group Chief Executive Philip Jansen available for interview.
""We cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings,"" spokesman Richard Farnsworth said.
In the past, BT has blamed former executives in Italy for the bookkeeping irregularities, saying they had kept their bosses in London in the dark about what was going on. The scandal required the company to take a 530 million pound charge in early 2017. For a timeline click on.
In a complaint filed in April 2017 with Milan prosecutors against the conduct of its former managers, BT said the company itself was a victim of any fraud found to have taken place.
Italian prosecutors named three top BT executives among an expanded list of 23 suspects allegedly involved in the debacle, Reuters exclusively reported in February. O’Ferrall was not on that list.
Prosecutors are not investigating O’Ferrall because he was not on BT Italy’s board and did not sign off on the division’s accounts in the four years, 2013-2016, under scrutiny, according to a source familiar with the probe.
O’Ferrall was appointed chairman of BT Italy in February 2017, taking up the post after an internal investigation was launched into the unit’s bookkeeping. He stepped down from that role in November 2018.
Prosecutors in Milan allege that three former senior BT executives, Luis Alvarez, Richard Cameron and Corrado Sciolla, set unrealistically high business targets and were complicit in false accounting at BT Italy. 
Alvarez and Cameron, were respectively the former chief executive and former chief financial officer of BT Global Services and Sciolla was the former head of continental Europe for BT. The three men, two of whom were based in London, left the company in 2017.
Reuters tried to contact Alvarez and Cameron via social media and email but they did not respond to those requests for comment. Sciolla declined to comment.
“AN URGENT REQUEST”
Allegations of fraudulent bookkeeping are part of a range of suspected wrongdoing at BT Italy. Italian prosecutors allege that a network of people at the unit exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit's true financial performance.
The company has publicly disclosed that it uncovered a complex set of improper sales, leasing transactions and factoring at the division. Factoring is a way in which firms sell future income to financiers for cash.
Several BT shareholders have filed a class-action lawsuit in the United States alleging the group misled investors and failed to promptly disclose the financial irregularities. BT has moved to have the case dismissed.
In their report, Italy’s financial police reference an email dated Aug. 5, 2016, from O’Ferrall in which he says that Cameron wanted operating profit to increase by 700,000 euros and suggests to Luca Sebastiani, then CFO at BT Italy, along with other colleagues across Europe, that they capitalize labor costs as a solution.
""All, I have an urgent request from Richard to find another €700K,"" O'Ferrall wrote to Sebastiani and his counterparts in Germany, Benelux, France, Spain, Hungary as well as Simon Whittle, then finance manager, reporting and consolidation, at Global Services Europe.
""Please can you look at all opportunities and come back to me and Simon asap. Labour capitalization? Regards Brian,"" says the email, whose subject line reads ""Another €700K EBITDA needed in P4.""
P4 refers to the month of July.
Reuters tried to reach Whittle via social media but he did not respond to requests for comment. The other finance officers O'Ferrall contacted did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
Sebastiani's lawyers, Giammarco Brenelli and Federico Riboldi, told Reuters the email was significant because ""along with many others, it shows the constant and unrelenting pressure the parent company was putting on European subsidiaries with regards to accounting policies.""
Sebastiani is among the 23 suspects in the case.
In another email, dated April 8, 2016 and sent to Sebastiani's predecessor Alessandro Clerici and Rosa Ronda Andres, CFO for BT Global Services in Spain, O'Ferrall says he has received a request ""to find another €1 million of capitalization for 15/16.
""Can either of you accommodate this? €500K each?"" the e-mail says.
Clerici and Andres did not comply with the request, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Andres did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Clerici declined to comment. He is among the 23 suspects in the case.
Capitalizing costs is an accounting method that allows companies to amortize a cost related to an asset over time as opposed to book it as an expense in the income statement when the cost was incurred. The technique allows companies to smooth out expenses over time, and therefore boost profits.
""You can't capitalize labor costs to improve earnings ex post (after the event), just to boost your accounts,"" said Gian Gaetano Bellavia, an accounting expert who has in the past worked as a consultant for the Milan prosecutors. He is not involved in the BT Italy investigation.
Bellavia said it was common for top executives of a parent company to ask managers of subsidiaries to ""always do more."" But he said some of the BT emails, which Reuters showed him a copy of, constituted ""significant evidence"" of wrongful accounting.
""EBITDA measures how much a company is earning. But to go up it needs actual income.”
Bellavia said another email, dated September 2016, in which Sebastiani says he has been told that Cameron would not accept an earnings estimate for the fiscal year 2016/17 below a certain amount, was less problematic because it could be interpreted as an aspiration and not a forecast communicated to investors. 
The police report says the alleged accounting irregularities could have had an impact on the price of BT shares and this may justify adding market manipulation to the list of alleged crimes being investigated. 
However, Milan prosecutors decided not to take this step on jurisdiction grounds, a source with direct knowledge of the probe said, since BT shares are listed in London and such allegations would have to be investigated by UK authorities.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) which investigates and prosecutes complex and often multinational fraud and corruption, declined to comment on whether it was investigating BT.
Britain’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it was continuing to investigate PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (PwC) audits of BT from 2015 to 2017. BT dropped PwC as its auditor in 2017.

A spokesman for the accounting firm said it would continue to cooperate fully with the FRC in its enquiries.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 03:36AM ET</span>",Facebook's flood of languages leaves it struggling to monitor content,"By Maggie Fick and Paresh Dave
NAIROBI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's struggles with hate speech and other types of problematic content are being hampered by the company's inability to keep up with a flood of new languages as mobile phones bring social media to every corner of the globe.
The company offers its 2.3 billion users features such as menus and prompts in 111 different languages, deemed to be officially supported. Reuters has found another 31 widely spoken languages on Facebook that do not have official support. 
Detailed rules known as ""community standards,"" which bar users from posting offensive material including hate speech and celebrations of violence, were translated in only 41 languages out of the 111 supported as of early March, Reuters found. 
Facebook's 15,000-strong content moderation workforce speaks about 50 tongues, though the company said it hires professional translators when needed. Automated tools for identifying hate speech work in about 30. 
The language deficit complicates Facebook's battle to rein in harmful content and the damage it can cause, including to the company itself. Countries including Australia, Singapore and the UK are now threatening harsh new regulations, punishable by steep fines or jail time for executives, if it fails to promptly remove objectionable posts.
The community standards are updated monthly and run to about 9,400 words in English.
Monika Bickert, the Facebook vice president in charge of the standards, has previously told Reuters that they were ""a heavy lift to translate into all those different languages."" 
A Facebook spokeswoman said this week the rules are translated case by case depending on whether a language has a critical mass of usage and whether Facebook is a primary information source for speakers. The spokeswoman said there was no specific number for critical mass.
She said among priorities for translations are Khmer, the official language in Cambodia, and Sinhala, the dominant language in Sri Lanka, where the government blocked Facebook this week to stem rumors about devastating Easter Sunday bombings.
A Reuters report found last year that hate speech on Facebook that helped foster ethnic cleansing in Myanmar went unchecked in part because the company was slow to add moderation tools and staff for the local language.
Facebook says it now offers the rules in Burmese and has more than 100 speakers of the language among its workforce.
The spokeswoman said Facebook's efforts to protect people from harmful content had ""a level of language investment that surpasses most any technology company.""
But human rights officials say Facebook is in jeopardy of a repeat of the Myanmar problems in other strife-torn nations where its language capabilities have not kept up with the impact of social media.
""These are supposed to be the rules of the road and both customers and regulators should insist social media platforms make the rules known and effectively police them,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. ""Failure to do so opens the door to serious abuses.""
ABUSE IN FIJIAN
Mohammed Saneem, the supervisor of elections in Fiji, said he felt the impact of the language gap during elections in the South Pacific nation in November last year. Racist comments proliferated on Facebook in Fijian, which the social network does not support. Saneem said he dedicated a staffer to emailing posts and translations to a Facebook employee in Singapore to seek removals.
Facebook said it did not request translations, and it gave Reuters a post-election letter from Saneem praising its ""timely and effective assistance."" 
Saneem told Reuters that he valued the help but had expected pro-active measures from Facebook.
""If they are allowing users to post in their language, there should be guidelines available in the same language,"" he said. 
Similar issues abound in African nations such as Ethiopia, where deadly ethnic clashes among a population of 107 million have been accompanied by ugly Facebook content. Much of it is in Amharic, a language supported by Facebook. But Amharic users looking up rules get them in English.
At least 652 million people worldwide speak languages supported by Facebook but where rules are not translated, according to data from language encyclopedia Ethnologue. Another 230 million or more speak one of the 31 languages that do not have official support. 
Facebook uses automated software as a key defense against prohibited content. Developed using a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning, these tools identify hate speech in about 30 languages and ""terrorist propaganda"" in 19, the company said.
Machine learning requires massive volumes of data to train computers, and a scarcity of text in other languages presents a challenge in rapidly growing the tools, Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president who oversees automated policy enforcement, has told Reuters.
GROWTH REGIONS
Beyond the automation and a few official fact-checkers, Facebook relies on users to report problematic content. That creates a major issue where community standards are not understood or even known to exist. 
Ebele Okobi, Facebook's director of public policy for Africa, told Reuters in March that the continent had the world's lowest rates of user reporting. 
""A lot of people don't even know that there are community standards,"" Okobi said.
Facebook has bought radio advertisements in Nigeria and worked with local organizations to change that, she said. It also has held talks with African education officials to introduce social media etiquette into the curriculum, she said.
Simultaneously, Facebook is partnering with wireless carriers and other groups to expand internet access in countries including Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo where it has yet to officially support widely-used languages such as Luganda and Kituba. Asked this week about the expansions without language support, Facebook declined to comment. 
The company announced in February it would soon have its first 100 sub-Saharan Africa-based content moderators at an outsourcing facility in Nairobi. They will join existing teams in reviewing content in Somali, Oromo and other languages.
But the community standards are not translated into Somali or Oromo. Posts in Somali from last year celebrating the al-Shabaab militant group remained on Facebook for months despite a ban on glorifying organizations or acts that Facebook designates as terrorist.
""Disbelievers and apostates, die with your anger,"" read one post seen by Reuters this month that praised the killing of a Sufi cleric. 
After Reuters inquired about the post, Facebook said it took down the author's account because it violated policies.
ABILITY TO DERAIL
Posts in Amharic reviewed by Reuters this month attacked the Oromo and Tigray ethnic populations in vicious terms that clearly violated Facebook's ban on discussing ethnic groups using ""violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls for exclusion.""
Facebook removed the two posts Reuters inquired about. The company added that it had erred in allowing one of them, from December 2017, to remain online following an earlier user report.
For officials such as Saneem in Fiji, Facebook's efforts to improve content moderation and language support are painfully slow. Saneem said he warned Facebook months in advance of the election in the archipelago of 900,000 people. Most of them use Facebook, with half writing in English and half in Fijian, he estimated.
""Social media has the ability to completely derail an election,"" Saneem said. 
Other social media companies face the same problem to varying degrees.
(GRAPHIC: Social media and the language gap - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VHjwTu) 
Facebook-owned Instagram said its 1,179-word community guidelines are in 30 out of 51 languages offered to users. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook as well, has terms in nine of 58 supported languages, Reuters found.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube presents community guidelines in 40 of 80 available languages, Reuters found. Twitter Inc's rules are in 37 of 47 supported languages, and Snap Inc's in 13 out of 21.

""A lot of misinformation gets spread around and the problem with the content publishers is the reluctance to deal with it,"" Saneem said. ""They do owe a duty of care. ""

372,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 03:34AM ET</span>",Tencent-backed live-streaming firm DouYu files for $500 million U.S. IPO,"By Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's largest live-streaming platform DouYu International Holdings Limited, backed by social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of up to $500 million.
DouYu, which primarily focuses on the live-streaming of games, is one of several Chinese start-ups in the growing market for live-streaming in China, along with U.S.-listed rival Huya Inc and Huajiao.
The rapid growth of the live-streaming sector has seen China's tech heavyweights - Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) - open their wallets to back a slew of firms in the hope it can boost existing services in e-commerce, social networking and gaming. 
DouYu has exclusive streaming rights to 29 major tournaments in China, including League of Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and DOTA2, according to the draft prospectus which was uploaded to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website overnight on Monday. 
DouYu was the largest game-streaming platform by average total monthly active users (MAUs) on both mobile and PC during the fourth quarter of 2018, according to the prospectus. The company had 159.2 million MAUs in the first quarter of 2019, representing year-on-year growth of 25.7 percent.
It set a placeholder sum of $500 million for the IPO, which is used to calculate registration fees. The final IPO size could be different, though sources have previously told Reuters DouYu was looking to raise around $500 million.
DouYu's IPO could be one of the largest this year by a Chinese company in the United States, together with that of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) challenger Luckin Coffee which also filed overnight.
Chinese companies have raised $271 million through U.S. IPOs so far this year, with the biggest deal being that of Ruhnn Holding Limited which raised $125 million, Refinitiv data showed.
LOSS MAKING
China is the world's largest game streaming market, with approximately 4.9 times the monthly active users of the U.S. market in 2018, the prospectus said.
DouYu's active users spent an average of 54 minutes per day on the platform in the fourth quarter of 2018.
DouYu is still loss-making and reported a net loss of $127.4 million in 2018, up from $91.33 million in 2017. Revenues jumped 94 percent to $531.5 million last year.
The company significantly increased its sales and marketing expenses - which jumped 73 percent in 2018 - as well as its research and development expenses which increased 55 percent.
Most of DouYu's revenues come from live-streaming through the sale of virtual gifts, accounting for 86.1 percent of its revenues, with the rest coming from advertisements and some revenue sharing with game developers and publishers, the prospectus showed.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the underwriters for DouYu's IPO.

374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 01:50AM ET</span>",Jet Airways Waits for Buyer as Rivals Muscle in on Territory,"(Bloomberg) -- A revival of Jet Airways India Ltd., once the nation’s biggest carrier by market value, is at risk as days roll by since its operations were completely halted.
While the cash-strapped carrier awaits potential investors to pump in money, rivals are aggressively going after its most prized assets. A government desperate to limit public backlash after flight ticket prices escalated is parceling off landing and parking slots at congested airports. Lessors are also adding to the woes by allocating grounded aircraft to competitors.
“It appears to me that lenders are not very confident of getting any serious bid,” said Harsh Vardhan, chairman of New Delhi-based Starair Consulting. “You can not hold on to slots, and planes are not Jet Airways’ property. They have to find a buyer as soon as possible.”
Jet Airways, the oldest surviving private airline which broke into a monopoly of Air India Ltd., had a fleet of 124 and flew profitable routes like connecting India, the fastest growing aviation market in the world, with London and Toronto. With nearly 23,000 jobs at stake, its collapse last week couldn’t have at worse time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who’s seeking a second term based on his business-friendly image.
While the arrangement to give Jet’s landing slots and aircraft to rivals is temporary, the process to swap them again is complicated and is the domain of airports. It may get more difficult once rivals start new flights and sell tickets in advance, and that could potentially leave close to nothing for a potential new owner.
New Owner
Jet Airways started flying in the early-1990s after India liberalized its economy, and quickly cemented its spot as a leading airline offering an alternative to Air India, while averting several downturns that forced dozens of its peers to close shop. But a boom of budget airlines in the mid 2000s, on top on rising fuel prices and a weakening rupee, kept adding to Jet Airways’ costs in the notoriously price-sensitive market.
The airline, which controlled 13.6 percent of the local market as recently as January, needs 85 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) to restart operations. So far, it isn’t clear whether Jet Airways will find a buyer to fly again, or if lenders will take it to a bankruptcy court. Over the weekend, local media reported Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, and salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group are keen to pick up a stake or purchase Jet’s assets.
Shares of Jet Airways (NS:JET) gained as much as 9.2 percent to 168.95 rupees in Mumbai and were trading at 167.35 rupees as of 11:06 a.m. local time. The shares plummeted 36 percent in the previous two trading sessions, after all flights were grounded last week.
Local carriers have been quick to take advantage of the situation. SpiceJet Ltd. plans to induct more than a dozen Boeing 737 planes, offering flights on the routes previously operated by Jet Airways. Market leader IndiGo, operated by Interglobe Aviation (NS:INGL) has also added additional flights from New Delhi and Mumbai, the two busiest airports of the nation which hardly had any landing slots available when Jet Airways was operating.
Ambani, who controls  Reliance Industries  Ltd. (NS:RELI), may partner Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC to pick up a stake in Jet Airways, while also exploring a possible bailout of state-run Air India Ltd, the Indian Express newspaper reported over the weekend. Etihad, which already owns 24 percent of the Jet Airways, has put in an initial bid showing interest in purchasing a stake in the carrier, the newspaper said.
The Tata Group may jump into the fray if the sale process fails, and bankruptcy proceedings kick in, the Mint newspaper reported separately, citing two unidentified people. The government reached out to the group, which has a majority stake in two local airlines, last year to potentially bail out the airline but it did not materialize into a deal.
A Reliance spokesman declined to comment but said the company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. A Tata group representative also declined to comment.
With lessors taking over aircraft and slots going to rivals, the value of Jet Airways has eroded, said Mark Martin, founder of Dubai-based Martin Consulting.
“The lenders should have paid some money to lessors and urged them not to take over the aircraft while the sale process is on, and should have finalized a payment plan for past dues over the next 18 months, Martin said. “But they did not, and that’s really unfortunate.”

Under the sales and purchase agreement, Exxon Mobil will supply 1 million tonnes a year of the super-chilled fuel to the provincial government-backed Zhejiang Energy, Exxon said in a statement late on Monday.
The agreement, which follows a framework deal announced last October, did not give details on price or timing, or say where the supplies will be sourced. 
Exxon Mobil said last year it would deliver the LNG starting in the early 2020s, while LNG supplies to China would come from its global portfolio.
The U.S. firm has been expanding its portfolio of LNG, including from upcoming projects in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and Golden Pass in the United States. 
Zhejiang Energy is building a 9 billion yuan ($1.34 billion) receiving terminal for the fuel in Wenzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, with annual handling capacity of 3 million tonnes.
Chinese state oil and gas major Sinopec will be a partner in the terminal.
Chen Zhu, managing director at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, said the Exxon-Zhejiang deal was separate from U.S.- China trade negotiations under which Chinese firms are expected to eventually boost purchases of U.S. gas.
""The gas supplies to the Zhejiang firm will come from Exxon's portfolio production outside the U.S.,"" Chen said, adding that the Wenzhou terminal is likely to be operational in 2022 or 2023.
Exxon already has two long-term LNG supply agreements in China, one each with Sinopec and CNPC, China's largest state oil group, she said.

The Politburo, the 25-member ruling body of the country headed by President Xi Jinping, concluded that China’s economic performance was “better than expected” and that market confidence has returned, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported.
The news came after China reported last week better-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter.

BlueMountain, a New York-based hedge fund, in March selected 13 candidates it hoped to install as directors at PG&E's board after slamming the embattled power utility for seeking bankruptcy protection.
As part of the agreement, BlueMountain will withdraw its nominee slate of 13 candidates and vote in favor of PG&E's board nominees at the meeting, PG&E said in a statement.
PG&E said it has appointed Fred Buckman, former chief executive officer of utilities Consumers Energy and PacifiCorp, as an independent director, effective immediately, while Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, will serve as a special independent safety adviser.
Buckman replaces Richard Kelly, who has resigned as a director.
Buckman and Hart, nominated by BlueMountain, will serve the same roles at PG&E's subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
The company said it will propose to increase the maximum size of PG&E's board to 15 directors, to be voted on at its annual meeting of shareholders.
""We believe the changes and other undertakings announced today reflect the boards' commitment to improving their governance and oversight,"" BlueMountain Chief Investment Officer Andrew Feldstein said in the statement.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January as it faces crushing liabilities related to deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes.
PG&E recently hired Bill Johnson as its CEO, after a group of investors, including Knighthead Capital Management, Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, pushed for his appointment.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 10:18PM ET</span>","T-Mobile, Sprint lobby regulators to win U.S. approval for tie-up","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior executives at T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp made the case to U.S. officials in Washington last week that they should approve a planned tie-up between the two wireless companies, arguing a combined firm would have incentives to ""aggressively lower prices.""
T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere, Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure, T-Mobile US chief operating officer Michael Sievert, and other senior executives met with Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday, according to a federal filing on Monday.
In a presentation made public on Monday, the firms said they would ""focus on taking share from Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T) through lower prices.""
If completed, the $26 billion merger would create a carrier with 127 million customers that would be a formidable competitor to the No.1 and No.2 wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, respectively.
A group of eight Democratic senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders in February urged the Justice Department and FCC to reject the deal, saying monthly bills for consumers could rise as much as 10 percent. Consumer advocates warn the deal will reduce the number of national wireless carriers to three from four.
Sources told Reuters last week that the Justice Department had concerns about the merger in its current structure.
A person briefed on the matter confirmed Legere met on Thursday with the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, as the government's review nears a conclusion. A decision is likely by early June, people briefed on the matter said.
The Justice Department declined comment.
T-Mobile has said the combined company would be better and faster at building 5G, the next generation of wireless, to compete with AT&T and Verizon.
In its presentation to Rosenworcel, T-Mobile cited Verizon's decision to charge $10 extra per month for 5G service. ""This won't happen when new T-Mobile introduces 5G,"" the presentation said.
The agreement to combine the carriers, struck in April 2018, was approved by both companies' shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Justice Department and FCC. A number of state attorneys general are also reviewing the deal.

To win support for the deal, T-Mobile had said it would not increase prices for three years and has pledged to use some spectrum for wireless broadband in rural areas. The firms say the combined entity would add 11,000 additional employees by 2024 compared to the standalone firms.

380,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",China's Starbucks Challenger Files for U.S. IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Luckin Coffee Inc., the ambitious startup that is challenging  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). in the race to dominate China’s growing coffee culture, filed for a U.S. initial public offering.
The Beijing-based company applied to list American depositary shares on Nasdaq under the ticker LK. The coffee unicorn is said to plan to raise around $300 million in the IPO, Bloomberg News reported in February. Last week, Luckin raised $150 million from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other investors at a valuation of $2.9 billion.
Luckin is spending millions of dollars a year opening outlets to unseat Starbucks as China’s top coffee company. Since its inception in June 2017, Luckin has quickly expanded into 2,370 stores in 28 cities, with backing from investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and China International Capital Corp. By the end of this year, Luckin aims to become the largest coffee network in China in terms of number of stores.
Starbucks, which entered China 20 years ago, has dominated the market with more than a 50 percent share in 2017. The company has more than 3,700 outlets in the country and is also expanding at break-neck speed, opening a new store roughly every 15 hours. It’s aiming to have 6,000 sites in China by 2023.
China may become an increasingly important market for coffee retailers due to the country’s low per-capita consumption of the beverage and rising middle-class affluence, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in January. Coffee consumption is estimated to grow by roughly 3 percent a year through 2023, according to Euromonitor.
Luckin, with a focus on convenience and affordability, is seeking to lure urban office workers who don’t need the big plush spaces offered by Starbucks. Many customers are initially attracted to the coffee chain by its free vouchers, and the company plans to keep investing heavily in discounts and deals.
Fast Delivery
Luckin’s outlets are cashless and designed for fast pick-up as well as delivery, with an app that rushes out deliveries in about 18 minutes. The company has a partnership with internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Starbucks only launched delivery in August, under a partnership with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
Chasing the entrenched rival has been costly. Xiamen-based Luckin said it’s burning through $130 million a year and may continue to see losses in the future. The company reported a net loss of $241.3 million for 2018, on total revenue of $125.3 million.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), CICC, and Haitong International are the underwriters for the IPO. Luckin plans to use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may including store expansions.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 08:15PM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz's new CEO looks beyond cost-cutting, big M&A","By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co's incoming chief executive, Miguel Patricio, is indicating a change in strategy for the packaged food company that could move it away from the aggressive cost-focused culture that has been in place since the company was created in 2015.
Patricio, a 52-year-old Portuguese native who will take over the helm of the world's fifth biggest food company from July 1, said he plans to focus more on efficiency, investing in brands and growing sales organically at a company that has been reeling from a $15.4 billion writedown on some of its brands.
Kraft Heinz's focus on cost-cutting and interest in scoring a big acquisition have been key to the company's strategy under management installed by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. 3G, along with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), forged the $49 billion merger of Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz in 2015.
""I think the obsession for efficiency has to be much bigger than the obsession for cutting costs,"" Patricio, 52, told Reuters on Monday. 
""Cost cutting should be a priority for any company. However, you cannot cut costs every year,"" said Patricio, who most recently was the global head of marketing for brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev's. He previously worked at Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
3G Capital, which is Kraft Heinz's second largest shareholder, behind Berkshire Hathaway, with a 22.15 percent stake, is known for scoring large M&A deals and using a controversial cost-cutting tool called zero-based budgeting to keep profit margins high. 
Zero-based budgeting requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use the prior year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.
Kraft Heinz's outgoing CEO, Bernardo Hees, a 3G partner, told Reuters in September that he was considering M&A to fuel growth.
Asked on Monday if Kraft Heinz was still considering big acquisitions, Patricio said he was sure the company would do so one day, but that his focus, for now, was on growing existing brands.
""At this moment, I'm really focused on the organic part of it. I think we can - and we need – to get organic growth and I'm going to put a lot of my time figuring that out.""
INVESTORS WANT PROOF
The announcement comes two months after Kraft Heinz took the massive writedown on some of its brands, cut its dividend and disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into accounting practices at its procurement unit. Intense competition from private-label brands, changing consumer habits and pressure from retailers to lower prices has sent the food industry reeling in recent years.
""Given what's happened at Kraft Heinz in the past several months, that 3G model has come into question,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""I think they realize they cut a little too far. 
""And to Patricio's point, it may now be about investing where you need to while maintaining cost discipline. Investors want to see proof that can grow sales."" Weissman said. ""It's good to hear they're not thinking about an imminent acquisition. From a balance sheet perspective, they're not there yet.""
3G did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Under Hees, Kraft Heinz lost half its market value, as it ceded market share to competitors and failed to snap up Anglo-Dutch consumer giant  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Plc in a proposed $143-billion merger. At the time, Unilever cited concerns about Kraft Heinz's culture.
Kraft Heinz's cost-focused strategy also gave way to a high-pressure, anxious environment, according to four former Kraft Heinz employees who worked at the company's Chicago headquarters and two former employees from Europe. 
The deep cuts and layoffs also ate away at advertising budgets and decades of industry experience, said two sources who worked at Kraft Heinz's marketing department.
""3G are known for being ruthless and brutal when it comes to cost and what does that do to culture?"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""It's too early to see how much flexibility Patricio will have to change the culture or improve processes at the company. Can he get those brands back to growth? That's probably going to take a lot of investment.""
Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a pillar of the Kraft Heinz culture, spokesman Michael Mullen said, noting that cost savings help the company increase support for its brands, drive innovation, and invest in top-tier talent. 
""In 2018, and again this year, savings from ZBB allow us to invest in new capabilities, emerging channels, and new product platforms for top-line growth,"" Mullen said.
Industry analysts have raised concerns that Kraft Heinz was pricing its brands too high at a time when private-label brands from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Aldi and Kroger (NYSE:KR) were gaining popularity. Kraft Heinz's ketchups, sliced cheeses and hot dogs were some of the first products these retailers sought to replicate at a lower price.
Buffett, whose  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz, highlighted the pressure from retailers in February, saying Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Corp's Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.
""These next two months, I'm going to dedicate fully to knowing the people (at Kraft Heinz), to build on culture, to agree or tweak the long-term strategy of the company, and to know the financials behind the business in detail. These are the four big things I want to do,"" Patricio told Reuters. 

""I bring diversity of thought to the team. My background is very different from the background of the other team members. And I think that this is critical in any company.""

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>","China Signals Less Stimulus, Undermining World's Hottest Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- The world’s best performing stock market is suddenly looking a lot more vulnerable after Beijing officials signaled they’re less comfortable about adding stimulus.
The CSI 300 Index of equities traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen sank 2.3 percent on Monday, its biggest loss in a month, with five stocks falling for each that rose. Property developers led the plunge, along with companies reliant on consumer discretionary spending and so-called old economy shares such as banks and industrial companies.
The slump bodes ill for Hong Kong’s equity market, which has been closed since the end of Thursday for holidays and reopens on Tuesday.
After the CSI 300 surged almost 40 percent this year, investors have grown increasingly sensitive to whether the authorities will maintain the massive scale of stimulus seen in the first quarter. A statement late Friday from a meeting of the Politburo was interpreted by traders as meaning the economy is on a stable enough footing that extended support isn’t needed. Instead there was a focus on deleveraging and avoiding speculation in the housing market.
""People have come to a clear consensus that there won’t be any aggressive stimulus that floods the economy with excessive liquidity, indicating limited room for valuation recovery,"" said Dai Ming, a Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. ""The market is entering a consolidation period that may last one to two months.""
China’s stock market has historically been driven by liquidity and momentum traders and any sense that these may dry up could act as a serious overhang. Equities slumped earlier this month amid concern the authorities would act to slow the increase in leverage in the market. The CSI 300 sank 4 percent on March 8 after investors took a rare sell rating from the nation’s largest brokerage as a sign that the government was unhappy about the speed of the rally.
The central bank last week gave a signal that supply of cash would be less liberal, when it rolled over only half of the funds coming due through one of its longer-term policy tools, instead offering more seven-day money.
""The Politburo meeting showed that investors had gotten ahead of themselves,"" said Wang Zhihong, managing director at Whiterock Asset Management Co. The phrasing of the statement, and the implication that real estate may be targeted, has weakened sentiment, he said.
A gauge of property developers in Shanghai tumbled 3.8 percent, its worst performance since March 8, with Gemdale Corp. and China Vanke Co. losing more than 6 percent. Sany Heavy Industry Co., which makes excavators and steam rollers, plunged the most in more than three years. Appliance makers also declined, led by Gree Electric Appliances Inc., which dropped from a record.
To be sure, analysts don’t expect China to shift to a significantly tighter stance, especially with rising pork prices boosting inflation. With the bond market weakening, stocks may still be a preferred alternative. The yield on 10-year government rose to 3.41 percent on Monday, poised for its highest close in five months.
""There is a bit of an overreaction"" in equities, said Gerry Alfonso, director of international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. ""Keeping leverage at reasonable levels will be good for the real economy and in the long term for the stock market.""
But with officials now showing concern about the risk of asset bubbles again, the days of making easy money on the stock market may be nearing an end. China’s equity market has added $2.5 trillion in market value since its low in October, and more than 50 companies on the CSI 300 have risen more than 50 percent this year, meaning there’s a lot of profit for some investors to pocket.
""The market lacks strong momentum to rise further,"" said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. ""Investors are now expecting a shift from unconventional stimulus policies we saw last year to more targeted measures to support the economy.""

386,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","RBS tops up small business support fund, downplays Brexit effect","By Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - British state-controlled lender the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) has doubled its funding pot to support small businesses to 6 billion pounds ($7.8 billion), but says the extra cash is no longer primarily for Brexit-proofing businesses.
NatWest, the biggest trading arm of RBS, said it had topped up its so-called Growth Fund in response to high demand from firms in industries including green energy and technology. 
The lender previously topped up the fund from 1 billion pounds to 3 billion pounds in October. It said at the time that it was doing so after identifying nearly 2,000 businesses it lent to that were likely to suffer payment or supply problems due to Britain's exit from the European Union.
Since then, Brexit has been repeatedly delayed amid deadlock in parliament and it is now unclear how Britain will leave the EU, if at all. 
Brexit remained a core driver behind expanding the fund, NatWest said, but stressed other factors.
""It’s really about demand from growth sectors in the UK economy,"" Mike Slevin, head of capital management at NatWest, told Reuters.
""Obviously it remains fully available for companies that require extra support for Brexit-related purposes as well.""
Customers were unlikely to roll back facilities taken out to prepare for Brexit while uncertainty continued, Slevin said, but demand for such products has ""waned somewhat"" in recent weeks.
Banks have been keen to promote their small business lending credentials ahead of Brexit, but groups representing small firms have expressed scepticism.
Rival lender  Barclays  (LON:BARC) announced a 14 billion pound fund over three years to help small firms manage uncertainty including Brexit last month.
However, Barclays' fund included all projected lending to small companies over a three-year period, rather than just extra cash over day-to-day funding.
A Barclays spokesperson said the 14 billion pounds would represent an increase of around a third in lending over the previous three year period.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 07:07PM ET</span>","Tesla says robotaxis coming to U.S. roads next year, slams rivals' use of Lidar","By Alexandria Sage and Vibhuti Sharma
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets next year, continuing a habit of bold pronouncements that have excited many investors while often missing deadlines. 
""Probably two years from now we'll make a car with no steering wheels or pedals,"" Musk predicted, while acknowledging he is often late to meet aggressive targets. 
Central to this promise is a new microchip for self-driving vehicles unveiled by Musk on Monday during a webcast presentation. Made by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd in Texas, the chip now in all vehicles is hoped to give Tesla an edge over rivals and show its massive investment in autonomous driving - described by Musk as ""basically our entire expense structure"" - will pay off. 
The webcast presentation came two days before Tesla is expected to announce a quarterly loss on fewer deliveries of its Model 3 sedan, which represents Tesla's attempt to become a volume car maker. 
After launching the event with detailed technical descriptions of Tesla's progress on hardware and software by top executives, Musk began hawking the Model 3 and its potential.
""The fundamental message consumers should be taking away today is it's financially insane to buy something other than a Tesla. It's like buying a horse,"" saying Tesla was the only company to have a full self-driving suite of hardware. 
Tesla's use of the term ""full self-driving"" garners criticism, as it sells such an option today that is not yet ""Level 4,"" or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention. Musk has said that with the hardware complete, improvements in software will allow vehicles to fully drive themselves in future. 
The technology faces many regulatory hurdles both in Washington and from local governments.
Global carmakers, large technology companies and startups are developing self-driving - including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc - but experts say it will be years before the systems are ready for prime time.
""A year from now we'll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything,"" Musk predicted. 
Tesla has been working on a self-driving chip since 2016 and Musk had previously forecast that cars would be fully self-driving by 2018, a target Tesla has missed. 
Investors appeared unmoved by the chip announcement but shares rose slightly in after-hour trading following the announcement of the robotaxis.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Tesla's robotaxi ambition was ""impressive,"" but added that investors will be concerned by ""the practicality and financial implications of this endeavor especially with Waymo miles ahead of the autonomous competition.""
More pressing for analysts, he said, were concerns about demand for the Model 3 and whether Tesla may seek new financing.
""DOOMED"" RIVALS
Musk took a swipe at competitors relying on Lidar, light-based sensors that are a key element in most other self-driving systems. 
""Lidar is a fools' errand. And anyone relying on Lidar is doomed,"" said Musk, who has been vocal about the technology's limitations. Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving. 
Competitors will eventually ""dump"" Lidar, he said: ""It's expensive and unnecessary and once you solved vision it's worthless."" 
More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into some 50 Lidar startups over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data in March.
Musk called Tesla's new chip the industry's best because it was dedicated for autonomous driving, while others, like Nvidia Corp, developed chips for multiple uses.
Tesla's chip was capable of seven times as many frames as Nvidia's Xavier system, said Pete Bannon, Tesla's head of Autopilot hardware. Nvidia said the comparison was inaccurate.
U.S. magazine Consumer Reports cautioned against Tesla's ""bold claims about self-driving capabilities that overpromise and underdeliver.""

""Claims about (Tesla's) driving automation systems and safety are not backed up by the data, and it seems today's presentations had more to do with investors than consumers' safety,"" wrote the publication.

The company has proposed a $1.2 billion increase in its currently approved cost of capital to address the heightened wildfire risk in California and for investment in infrastructure safety.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of liabilities from the California wildfires, including the catastrophic 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people. 
The increase will not affect customers on the company's discount plan. 
The proposal will also boost PG&E's return on equity (ROE) to 16 percent from 10.25 percent, the company said. 
If approved, the average residential gas customer would see their monthly bill go up by 7.7 percent, effective Jan. 1.
The company said it expects the current plan to help fund about $28 billion in energy infrastructure investments over the next four years.
Separately, Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison (SoCal) on Monday urged the CPUC to include a wildfire risk component in setting the company's cost of capital for operations for a three-year period, starting 2020. 
SoCal, which is owned by Edison International (NYSE:EIX), earlier this month, requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an ROE of 17.12 percent, including incentives and investments in new technologies and clean energy projects.

Investigators have found that the devastating Thomas Fire in northwest of Los Angeles was sparked by power lines owned by SoCal.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>",Samsung delays Galaxy Fold phone launch over screen problems,"By Angela Moon and Ju-min Park
(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd said on Monday it would delay the retail launch of its Galaxy Fold smartphone for an unspecified period of time after reviewers discovered problems with the display, a hit to the reputation of the world's largest handset maker.
Last week, reviewers started posting problems with the device on Twitter, but as of Friday the company did not know the root cause of the screen defects, according to Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, who said he was in direct contact with the company.
About 50 units of the $1,980 foldable device had been sent for review to journalists, analysts and bloggers in the United States ahead of a planned April 26 launch, Moorhead said. 
It was not immediately clear how many of the devices were defective. Four units sent to journalists and a YouTube personality contained problems, according to their posts on Twitter.
Samsung declined comment beyond a prepared statement.
""To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold. We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks,"" a Samsung spokesperson said on Monday.
Samsung also postponed media events for the device planned for this week in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
While Samsung has not said how long the delay could be or whether production of the unit has halted completely, some analysts said the delay was minor compared to the massive recall and production halt that the company endured with its Galaxy Note 7 in 2016.
""It's certainly an embarrassment to Samsung's reputation but this won't have much financial impact on them since they created a whole new category of foldables with this product. There is no market share to lose,"" said Moorhead, who added that his test version of the phone was working without any issues.
Instead of plaudits ahead of the phone's planned launch, the South Korean conglomerate has been blighted by a handful of technology journalists reporting breaks, bulges and blinking screens.
Samsung said initial findings showed that the issues could be associated with impact on exposed areas of the hinges. It also said there were instances where substances found inside the device affected the display performance.
Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit, predicted the issue would likely be resolved within a month.
""We all know that Samsung has a technology that works. It's likely that this glitch is a problem with mass production and the failure is just in the single digit percentage,"" he said. 
Samsung has hailed the folding design as the future in a field that has seen few surprises since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhone in 2007. Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has also announced a folding handset, the Mate X.
Samsung was initially planning to begin South Korean and European sales of the unit in May and Chinese sales from an undisclosed date.

AT&T (NYSE:T), one of Samsung's U.S. launch partners for the Galaxy Fold, said the carrier was working to communicate with customers who pre-ordered the device as soon as possible. AT&T did not disclose the number of pre-orders.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>","Halliburton sees signs of price recovery, shares dip","By Debroop Roy and Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co sought to convince investors on Monday that weak pricing which has undermined oilfield services providers over four years was on the verge of turning a corner. 
Better-than-expected revenue in North America, along with the company's claim that prices were bottoming out, initially drove shares in the oilfield services giant almost 5 percent higher after it published first quarter results. 
But analysts and investors were unconvinced by a post-earnings conference call with management, which gave little hard evidence and left doubts over future pricing at a time when oil producers have been cutting investments. 
Shares ended the day down four cents apiece at $31.09. 
""I don't think there was anything in there to get people off the sidelines,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at brokerage Edward Jones, arguing the company's comments fell short of what was needed to shift sentiment around the industry.
""We are still kind of in the hope phase that the second half is going to look better,"" she said. 
Halliburton and larger rival Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) have been struggling with a tightening of spending by U.S. oil producers in response to shareholder pressure for greater returns following a period of heavy investment in shale.
The Houston-based company, known globally for its investment in post-war Iraq, posted an 11 percent rise in international revenue on the back of gains in Mexico, Argentina and the Middle East, areas where Schlumberger also reported gains last week.
However, in contrast to its larger rival, Halliburton said activity in its largest market, North America, was modestly higher. It added that it expects demand for its services to progress modestly for the next couple of quarters.
""We believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us,"" Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said.
Schlumberger last week posted a 3 percent fall in revenue from North America, blaming softer pricing and lower activity for its hydraulic fracking and drilling businesses.
Halliburton's revenue from the region fell 7 percent to $3.3 billion in the three months ended March 31, but came in above the $3.13 billion that five analysts had estimated on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
As expected, Miller also forecast further falls - a 6 percent to 10 percent decline in spending by oil producers in North America in 2019 - lower than the 10 percent fall forecast by Schlumberger. 
The company said it expects second quarter margins to rise 50 to 150 basis points from the first in both its drilling and evaluation units, as well as in its completion and production business. 
Revenue at the drilling and evaluation business is expected to rise in the low single digits percentage sequentially, while it is expected to grow mid-single digits in completion and production. 
The company also reiterated its expectation of high single-digit percentage growth for 2019 in international markets.

On an adjusted basis, it earned 23 cents per share, edging past an average estimate of 22 cents. Revenue of $5.74 billion also beat a consensus of $5.53 billion.

393,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Jet Airways Waits for a Buyer as Rivals Muscle in on Territory,"(Bloomberg) -- A revival of Jet Airways India Ltd., once the nation’s biggest carrier by market value, is at risk as days roll by since its operations were completely halted.
While the cash-strapped carrier awaits potential investors to pump in money, rivals are aggressively going after its most prized assets. A government desperate to limit public backlash after flight ticket prices escalated is parceling off landing and parking slots at congested airports. Lessors are also adding to the woes by allocating grounded aircraft to competitors.
“It appears to me that lenders are not very confident of getting any serious bid,” said Harsh Vardhan, chairman of New Delhi-based Starair Consulting. “You can not hold on to slots, and planes are not Jet Airways’ property. They have to find a buyer as soon as possible.”
Jet Airways, the oldest surviving private airline which broke into a monopoly of Air India Ltd., had a fleet of 124 and flew profitable routes like connecting India, the fastest growing aviation market in the world, with London and Toronto. With nearly 23,000 jobs at stake, its collapse last week couldn’t have at worse time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who’s seeking a second term based on his business-friendly image.
While the arrangement to give Jet’s landing slots and aircraft to rivals is temporary, the process to swap them again is complicated and is the domain of airports. It may get more difficult once rivals start new flights and sell tickets in advance, and that could potentially leave close to nothing for a potential new owner.
New Owner
Jet Airways started flying in the early-1990s after Indian liberalized its economy, and quickly cemented its spot as a leading airline offering an alternative to Air India, while averting several downturns that forced dozens of its peers to close shop. But a boom of budget airlines in the mid 2000s, on top on rising fuel prices and a weakening rupee, kept adding to Jet Airways’ costs in the notoriously price-sensitive market.
The airline, which controlled 13.6 percent of the local market as recently as January, needs 85 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) to restart operations. So far, it isn’t clear whether Jet Airways will find a buyer to fly again, or if lenders will take it to a bankruptcy court. Over the weekend, local media reported Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, and salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group are keen to pick up a stake or purchase Jet’s assets.
Shares of the Jet Airways have plummeted 36 percent since all flights were grounded, inching closer to their lifetime low. It fell 6 percent to 154.70 rupees on Wednesday.
Local carriers have been quick to take advantage of the situation. SpiceJet Ltd. plans to induct more than a dozen Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 planes, offering flights on the routes previously operated by Jet Airways. Market leader IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. has also added additional flights from New Delhi and Mumbai, the two busiest airports of the nation which hardly had any landing slots available when Jet Airways was operating.
Ambani, who controls Reliance Industries Ltd., may partner Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC to pick up a stake in Jet Airways, while also exploring a possible bailout of state-run Air India Ltd, the Indian Express newspaper reported over the weekend. Etihad, which already owns 24 percent of the Jet Airways, has put in an initial bid showing interest in purchasing a stake in the carrier, the newspaper said.
The Tata Group may jump into the fray if the sale process fails, and bankruptcy proceedings kick in, the Mint newspaper reported separately, citing two unidentified people. The government reached out to the group, which has a majority stake in two local airlines, last year to potentially bail out the airline but it did not materialize into a deal.
A Reliance spokesman declined to comment but said the company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. A Tata group representative also declined to comment.
With lessors taking over aircraft and slots going to rivals, the value of Jet Airways has eroded, said Mark Martin, founder of Dubai-based Martin Consulting.
“The lenders should have paid some money to lessors and urged them not to take over the aircraft while the sale process is on, and should have finalized a payment plan for past dues over the next 18 months, Martin said. “But they did not, and that’s really unfortunate.”

The Dow  slipped 0.18%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.22%.
Gains were held back in part because a number of financial markets were closed, including Germany, the U.K., France and Hong Kong.
Crude oil prices moved sharply higher after the Trump Administration threatened sanctions starting after May 2 against five countries if they continue to import Iranian oil. The group includes India, China, Turkey, Japan and South Korea. The goal is to cut Iranian exports close to zero and force the Iranian government to renegotiate a deal made with the Obama Administration.

The Trump administration and others, including Saudi Arabia and Israel, believe Iran uses its oil revenues to finance terrorist activities in the Middle East and elsewhere. The White House also believes Saudi Arabia and the UAE will boost production to offset the effect of the decline in Iranian supplies on global markets.
While energy stocks moved higher, airlines, always sensitive to fuel-price changes, were lower. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Alaska Airlines NYSE:ALK) both fell more than 2%.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 04:39PM ET</span>",Wall Street near flat in quiet session ahead of earnings wave,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a low-volume trading session little changed on Monday, with the biggest gains in the energy sector as investors otherwise stayed on the sidelines ahead of quarterly earnings.
Investors were waiting for some of the biggest S&P 500 companies, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to report first-quarter results later in the week. Additional reports could ease investor fears of an earnings recession.
Trading volume - which was the lowest so far in 2019 - was also muted by the fact that some investors were still on vacation after Friday's U.S. market holiday and because markets were closed in parts of Europe and Asia on Monday. 
Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York said he has been encouraged by quarterly results even though it was early in the reporting season. 
""To some degree it could be some concern because we know it's a big earnings week. What will the overall tenor of this week look like by Friday?"" said Orlando.
Orlando was impressed with the latest GDPNow forecast from the Atlanta Federal Reserve for a first-quarter expansion of 2.8% compared with a 0.2% forecast a month ago.
""That tells you the data has turned around and maybe earnings aren't going to be so bad,"" he said. 
S&P 500 profits are expected to drop 1.7% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data, in what would be the first earnings contraction since 2016.
But more than three-quarters of 82 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have surpassed beaten-down expectations.
With the S&P trading at less than 1% below its record high reached in September, investors were also waiting for upcoming data such as first-quarter GDP before making bigger bets.

1. Here Comes the Earnings Deluge
Investors must brace for the earnings avalanche coming tomorrow.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) reports ahead of the bell, with analysts predicting a profit of 15 cents per share on revenue of about $774 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But engagement metrics might have more of an impact on the stock. The company is no longer reporting monthly active users (MAUs) and will report daily active users (DAUs) instead. The company feels this metric is a better measure of its user base.
Twitter said in February it had 126 million daily active users.
Consumer goods powerhouse Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is also on the calendar. Analysts predict a fiscal third-quarter profit of $1.03 per share, with sales of about $16.4 billion.
For fiscal 2019, P&G guided earnings per share growth of 3% to 8%, with total sales growth in the range of down 1% to up 1%.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) also weighs in, with the consensus estimate for earnings of 46 cents a share and sales of about $7.9 billion.
Shares are about flat year to date.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report results.
2. New Home Sales Seen Falling
Following a worse-than-expected drop in existing home sales reported today, the Commerce Department will report on March new home sales at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Sales of new homes are expected to have dropped 3% last month to an annual rate of 647,000.
At 9 AM ET, the government will report its house price index for February, with economists predicting a month-on-month rise of 0.6%, the same as the month before.
And at 9:45 AM ET, Markit will issue its measure of services activity for April.
Economists, on average, expect that the services purchasing manager’s index edged up to 56.
3. Can U.S. Crude Make up Iran Shortfalls?
Oil prices jumped sharply today in response to President Donald Trump’s decision not to renew sanctions waivers for importing crude from Iran.
Traders will be looking tomorrow from any hints from OPEC about whether it will pump more to make up some of the supply shortfall.
They will also get a glimpse of how much the U.S. can add to the mix when the American Petroleum Institute releases its snapshot of oil inventories.
The API estimated inventories fell by 3 million barrels last week, following three-straight weeks of builds. The Energy Information Administration reported an official drop of about 1.4 million barrels last week."

404,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",Bombardier eyes higher sales from retrofitting trains,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier Inc sees higher sales from modernizing existing rail cars as the company works to further diversify its largest division as measured in revenue, a spokesman said this month. 
Bombardier projects that a quarter of its transportation division's expected 2020 revenue of $10 billion will come from rail services, up from 18 percent in 2014, according to a company investor presentation. Rail services include retrofitting, operations and maintenance.
The Montreal-based company is counting on its transportation and corporate jet divisions for growth as it sheds its money-losing commercial aviation businesses. It closed a deal last summer to cede a controlling stake in its largest narrowbody program to Europe's Airbus SE. 
But the company has wrestled with execution problems and delays on rail contracts that led earlier this year to the temporary halting of car deliveries in New York because of air compressor software defects, and in Switzerland because of faulty doors. New York deliveries have since resumed. 
As it pursues retrofitting contracts, Bombardier is eying a possible plan by the largest U.S. rapid transit system to modernize around 1,000 subway cars made by the company in the late 1990s and early 2000s, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The New York City Transit Authority is weighing a plan to retrofit its R142 subway car fleet with modern technology like Wi-Fi, but has not formally called for bids, one of the sources said. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. 
Transit agencies, which have traditionally bought new cars, are considering retrofits to respond to customer demand for amenities like Wi-Fi and accommodations for disabled riders. 
According to the American Public Transit Association (APTA), the average U.S. subway and commuter rail car is now around 22 years old, about halfway through its 40-year life span and still young enough to retrofit.
A spokesman for New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which oversees NYC Transit, did not respond to requests for comment.
Bombardier declined to comment on New York, but the company spokesman sees demand for retrofitting as manufacturing costs rise. 
""With increasing costs to produce new trains and the limited availability of federal funding support for large rolling stock acquisitions, a potential exists for reinvesting in existing rolling stock equipment,"" company spokesman Eric Prud'Homme said by email.
Prud'Homme would not disclose details about the division's sales or margins from retrofitting.
Retrofitting delivers higher margins and is considered less risky than building new, because the complexity of some vehicle orders can lead to delays, rail industry executives say.
Among its retrofitting orders, Bombardier won a $255 million contract to upgrade trains in Australia earlier this month.
Modernizing, however, brings challenges for agencies because it takes vehicles out of service to be retrofitted. Such a move risks creating gridlock in New York City which ""is already busting at the seams,"" said one of the sources. 
Prud'Homme said retrofitting can generally accommodate agencies by conducting the work when cars are taken out of service for regular maintenance. 
New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford recently left the door open to Bombardier winning more work because of improvements on their contract. 

""The more they (Bombardier) now deliver and the more the units work straight out of the box ... and the fewer the defects when they turn up, the stronger case they make in the future,"" Byford told reporters on the sidelines of the agency's March board meeting.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 03:56PM ET</span>",Nissan to reject new integration proposal from Renault: Nikkei,"By Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd will reject a management integration proposal from French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and will call for an equal capital relationship, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday, citing sources.
Nissan's management feels the Japanese company has not been treated as an equal of Renault under existing capital ties, and a merger would make this inequality permanent, the Nikkei said https://s.nikkei.com/2veityL.
The outlook for the alliance - one of the world's top automaking partnerships - has been in focus since the arrest in November of its main architect, Carlos Ghosn, for financial misconduct. The former Nissan and Renault chairman has denied the charges against him and has said he was the victim of a boardroom coup by Nissan executives opposed to closer ties.
Renault saved Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago and under their current capital alliance, the French company holds greater control over its much larger partner.
Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa declined to say whether the company had received such a proposal from Renault. 
""Now is not the time to think of such things,"" he told a group of reporters outside of his house in Tokyo. ""At the moment we are focused on improving Nissan's earnings performance. Please give us time to do that.""
Renault declined to comment on the report. 
Renault has argued in its proposal that an integration would maximise synergies within the French-Japanese alliance, according to the Nikkei.
The Financial Times reported last month of Renault's intention to restart merger talks with Nissan within 12 months.
The two companies said in March they would put themselves on more equal footing, breaking up the all-powerful chairmanship previously wielded by Ghosn.
The alliance between Renault and Nissan was first set up in 1999 and was expanded in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors.

Separately, Japanese prosecutors indicted Ghosn on Monday on another charge of aggravated breach of trust, the fourth charge against him, which his lawyers met immediately with a bail request.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 03:21PM ET</span>",Oil jumps on U.S. plans to tighten Iran sanctions; dollar eases,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil jumped almost 3% on Monday after the United States said it will take more steps to choke off Iranian oil exports, while U.S. equities were little changed as Wall Street braced for corporate results in a busy earnings week.
The dollar eased against a basket of currencies in thin holiday-impacted trading as gold held above a near four-month low on support from the weaker greenback. 
The United States said it will eliminate all waivers that allowed eight countries to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions, demanding that the purchases of Iranian oil stop by May 1. The announcement sent oil prices to 2019 highs.Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose as much as 3.5% a barrel and settled at $74.04 a barrel, up $2.07. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.70 to settle at $65.70 after rising as much as 3% during the session.
Another drop in Iranian exports would further squeeze supply in a market already tightened through U.S. sanctions against Iran and fellow OPEC member Venezuela, along with voluntary cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
""This does bring a lot more uncertainty in terms of global supplies,"" said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. ""It is a bullish surprise for the market.""
Major financial markets in Europe were closed for Easter Monday, as were markets in Australia and Hong Kong. 
Stocks on Wall Street hovered near break-even as the benchmark S&P 500 index was about 1% away from the record high hit in September, boosted in part by largely positive earnings in a market that had sharply lowered its expectations.
About one-third of the S&P 500 companies, including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), will report their quarterly earnings this week.
The results will determine whether investors should be concerned about the start of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided. [.N/O] S&P 500 profits are expected to drop 1.7% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data, in what could be the first earnings contraction since 2016.
""The market knows and understands earnings are going to be markedly lower this quarter,"" said Robert Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ""It's the beginning of the next turn in the cycle which is softer earnings."" 
The S&P energy index jumped 1.95%, the most among the major S&P sectors, as oil prices surged on the U.S. crackdown on Iranian oil exports. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.35 points, or 0.2%, to 26,506.19. The S&P 500 gained 0.51 points, or 0.02%, to 2,905.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.55 points, or 0.11%, to 8,006.61.
Overnight in Asia shares slipped, pulled lower by underperforming Chinese stocks that retreated from a 13-month high. Comments from top policy-making bodies raised investor fears that Beijing will slow the pace of policy easing after some signs of stabilization in China.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.3%, edging away from a nine-month peak last week after Chinese economic data beat expectations and eased concerns about the health of the world economy.
The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 1.7 percent and Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.08%.
The greenback has found support in recent weeks on the back of a gradual rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and signs of strength in the world's top economy, including better-than-expected retail sales in March.
The dollar index fell 0.19%, with the euro up 0.12% to $1.1259. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 111.95 per dollar. 
The Treasury yield curve steepened at the start of a busy week in which $237 billion of new U.S. government debt will be auctioned off. 
The spread between the two- and 10-year note yields, the most common measure of the yield curve, steepens when longer-dated yields rise faster than shorter-dated yields, suggesting bullish investor sentiment. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to push its yield up to 2.5921%.
U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% higher at $1,277.60 an ounce.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Monday she named four experts to a blue-ribbon committee to review the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) aircraft certification process after two deadly Boeing 737 MAX crashes killed nearly 350 people.
Chao said she was naming NASA's former aviation safety program director Amy Pritchett and Gretchen Haskins, chief executive of HeliOffshore Ltd, an international expert in aviation safety and a former U.S. Air Force officer. 
She also named Kenneth Hylander, chief safety officer at Amtrak and a former senior safety executive at Delta and Northwest airlines, and J. David Grizzle, chairman of the board of Republic Airways and a former FAA chief counsel.
The committee is ""specifically tasked to review the 737 MAX 800 certification process from 2012 to 2017, and recommend improvements to the certification process.""
U.S. lawmakers have criticized the FAA's program that allows  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and other manufacturers to oversee the process that ensures air worthiness and other vital safety aspects of new aircraft.
Chao said last month the panel would be co-chaired by retired Air Force General Darren McDew, the former head of the U.S. Transportation Command, and Lee Moak, a former president of the Air Line Pilots Association.

Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department’s inspector general and lawmakers are investigating the FAA’s certification of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft. A joint review by 10 governmental air regulators is also set to start April 29.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA is re-examining its treatment of whistleblower complaints after the indictment of six of the state-run oil firm's traders in December indicated that efforts to root out corruption had faltered, according to three people familiar with the matter.
In recent weeks, officials at Petrobras, as the firm is known, have summoned a number of current and former employees who had flagged instances of corruption at the company, particularly in relation to its trading operations, the sources said.
Company officials questioned the employees on how their complaints had been handled, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. Some of the employees said they were unsatisfied with the company's response and believed the wrongdoing was not addressed, sources said.
In a statement, Petrobras said it was not investigating its controls but rather carrying out a thorough internal probe relating to the December oil trading indictments, with some 27 professionals looking into the matter. 
The firm said it could not go into detail regarding the internal probe, citing the need to protect employees and the integrity of the investigation. 
The enquiry underlines how Petrobras is still working to improve compliance and root out the graft at the center of Brazil's five-year ""Car Wash"" investigation, considered by U.S. law enforcement to be the largest corporate corruption case ever. 
The scandal has spread across Latin America, toppling governments, destroying business empires and leading Peru's former president Alan Garcia to kill himself last week to avoid arrest in a related investigation.
Petrobras has said that a robust compliance department and beefed up internal investigations team have helped it to correct course since the Car Wash probes came to light in 2014 with revelations about political bribes paid by contracting firms.
However, in December, Brazilian prosecutors blew the lid off another kickback scheme, this time in the oil trading division of Petrobras, which also implicated commodities trading giants  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) PLC, Vitol SA and Trafigura AG.
In March, Reuters reported that Petrobras officials had known of problems in its oil trading operations for years, although the company failed to quickly identify suspects and sideline them from operations.
Of the six people indicted in December, one pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and is cooperating with U.S. authorities in a parallel investigation of the scheme, Reuters reported in February.
Those indictments were focused on the company's Houston trading desk. Some of the employees interviewed by Petrobras in recent weeks had previously complained of irregularities at the Singapore desk, the sources said, raising the possibility that the probe could expand geographically.
Petrobras did not comment on those allegations.
According to documents sent to Brazilian federal police investigators and seen by Reuters, a Singaporean employee complained to Petrobras officials in December 2012 of irregular trading of bunker fuel, which is used by ships.
A subsequent internal investigation found that Petrobras had paid unusual premiums for a significant quantity of bunker fuel in 2012, according to the documents, which were dated late 2012 and early 2013. Internal investigators recommended a series of measures to improve transparency at the Singaporean trading unit. It is unclear if those measures were carried out.

The federal police did not respond to a request for comment.

The Beijing-based coffee chain set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO and did not disclose the number of shares it would offer, a filing with the regulator showed. 
Luckin Coffee, expanding at breakneck speed, currently operates 2,370 stores in 28 Chinese cities and plans to open 2,500 new stores this year - displacing Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain in the process.
In its latest round of funding, Luckin raised $150 million from investors including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), valuing https://reut.rs/2KYMdKS the company at $2.9 billion.
However, the company is still loss making.
Since inception on June 16, 2017, the company has been in the red, with net loss to shareholders coming at $475.4 million in the year ended Dec. 31, 2018 and total revenue of $125.27 million, according to the filing. For the first three months of this year, it continued to post a net loss of $85.3 million.
Luckin said it would continue to spend on increasing its brand awareness, expand its customer base and store network, and invest heavily in offering discounts and deals to keep bringing in more customers through its doors. 
It, however, cautioned that revenues may not grow at the rate it expects that would offset higher expenses in the near future due to changes in regulation and increasing competition. 
Luckin said it could continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future and ""we cannot assure you that we will eventually achieve our intended profitability."" 
The coffee chain was co-founded by Chief Executive Qian Zhiya, the former chief operating officer of Car Inc, and two other senior executives, and is backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd.
The company, which intends to list under the symbol ""LK"" on the Nasdaq, chose New York for the listing as Hong Kong generally requires IPO applicants to have a track record of three financial years, sources told Reuters earlier.
The size of the IPO stated in preliminary filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final IPO size could be different.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are some of the underwriters to the IPO.

(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co named Miguel Patricio as its next chief executive on Monday, hoping the 30-year marketing veteran will revitalize brands such as Planters nuts and Oscar Mayer bacon at one of the world's largest packaged food companies.
Patricio, a 52-year-old native of Portugal, will take over the top job in July after two decades at Anheuser-Busch InBev, where he rose to become the company's global head of marketing, building sales of beer brands Corona, Budweiser and others. 
Before AB InBev, Patricio worked at major consumer companies including Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
He succeeds Bernardo Hees, 49, who was made CEO in 2015 when Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged.
His appointment comes two months after Kraft Heinz slashed its quarterly dividend, wrote down the value its marquee Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets by more than $15 billion. It also disclosed that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Kraft Heinz's second-biggest shareholder, Brazilian private equity fund 3G Capital, has pushed the company to rein in expenses to tackle higher costs and sluggish growth, a strategy it has successfully implemented at holdings including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch.
""Great companies are the ones that have the costs in control, that grow the top line, and grow the bottom line – it’s not one or the other, Patricio said in an interview. “I have very good experience on that - on being more efficient every year, which doesn't mean cutting costs. It means to be more efficient.""
Kraft's cost cuts, made at the urging of 3G, resulted in smaller marketing and advertising budgets for key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon and the loss of brand managers, which translated to market share loss to cheaper, private-label competitors, according to two former Kraft Heinz marketing employees. 
On top of that, the broad sector has struggled with rising transportation and commodity costs along with a shift in consumer preferences to more niche health-focused brands.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and 3G together own close to 50 percent of Kraft Heinz. Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately response to requests for comment. 
SEC PROBE
The company also disclosed in February that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation into its accounting policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement.
At the time, Kraft said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a $25 million increase to the cost of products sold.
""The change at the top of Kraft Heinz is a positive development,"" said Roosevelt Investment Group fund manager Jason Benowitz, which previously held a stake in Kraft Heinz.
""It shows that management and the board understand the serious nature of the challenges facing the company. Kraft Heinz ... cannot further cost cut its way to prosperity.""
The company's shares were flat at $32.96. The stock has lost half its value since Heinz and Kraft merged.
Kraft Heinz has been the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 Packaged Foods and Meats index over the last year, falling some 43 percent. 
""By appointing Mr. Patricio as the new CEO, it appears that Kraft Heinz is doubling down on its efforts to reinvigorate the top line,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note. 

Patricio's experience as the president of Asia Pacific of Anheuser-Busch InBev might enable him to explore more growth opportunities in emerging markets at Kraft Heinz, she said.

Along with domestic peers such as  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Auchan, Casino faces intense price competition in its home market as well as challenges from online players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Last month Casino raised its goal for the disposal of non-strategic assets to at least 2.5 billion euros by the first quarter of 2020.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 12:39PM ET</span>",Model S fire video adds to Tesla woes pre-results,"By Brenda Goh and Yilei Sun
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Video of a parked Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Model S exploding and a Wall Street downgrade of the electric carmaker's stock pushed shares down 4 percent on Monday, as it prepared to issue results for a troubled first quarter. 
Brokerage Evercore cut its recommendation on shares of the Silicon Valley company to ""sell"", becoming the twelfth brokerage to ask investors to abandon billionaire Elon Musk's venture and raising bearish sentiment to its highest ever.
Musk and Tesla have faced a range of challenges over the past year as one of the leaders in electric vehicle technology sought to ramp up production, deliveries and sales of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability.
The company, which is struggling with deliveries of its higher-priced Model S and X luxury cars, said it has sent a team to investigate the video on Chinese social media apparently showing the latest in a string of fires involving its cars. 
The video, time stamped Sunday evening and widely shared on China's Twitter-like Weibo, shows the parked vehicle emitting smoke and bursting into flames seconds later. 
A video purportedly of the aftermath showed a line of three cars completely destroyed.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the origins of the video, which Weibo users said was taken in Shanghai. 
The cause of the explosion could not be immediately ascertained from the videos.
""We immediately sent a team onsite and we're supporting local authorities to establish the facts. From what we know now, no one was harmed,"" Tesla said in a statement.
It declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters.
There have been at least 14 instances of Tesla cars catching fire since 2013, with the majority occurring after a crash.
""The car fire is just another data point of continued difficulties,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin wrote in an email. ""Not a lot of good news for Tesla these days."" 
Tesla will report its first-quarter results on Wednesday and had flagged in February that it expects to post a loss as it launched a cheaper $35,000 Model 3 sedan.
""We remain encouraged by Tesla's vision and future growth prospects, but there is increased uncertainty around near-term demand versus previous bullish forecasts and growth cannot stall for a growth company,"" Evercore analysts wrote in their note downgrading the shares. 
The change meant 38.7 percent of analysts now have a sell rating on Tesla, topping the previous record of 36.8 percent in November, 2016.
REPUTATION IN CHINA
The latest fire incident comes as Tesla tries to push sales in China, where its prices were impacted by tit-for-tat tariffs imposed during Sino-U.S. trade tensions last year.
The automaker currently imports all the cars it sells in China, but is building a factory in Shanghai that will initially make its Model 3 and help reduce the hit of a trade war.
In March, Tesla was also on the receiving end of a labeling mix-up at Shanghai customs that led to a temporary suspension of clearance for a batch of Model 3 cars.
Analysts said the latest fire incident would likely increase attention on the safety of EVs, but was unlikely to have a significant impact on Tesla's sales or reputation in China while the cause was being investigated.
""Tesla had fire incidents before, but they didn't have a big impact on its reputation in China,"" said analyst Alan Kang at LMC Automotive. 
""Since its consumer base is not particularly conservative, and China is pushing the electric vehicle market, if this incident is just accidental, it will not have a big impact on Tesla,"" he said.
""Tesla self-ignites"" was one of the most popular hashtags on Weibo on Monday, racking up over 20 million clicks. Some users urged the automaker to quickly find the cause, whereas others speculated over the impact to the value of Tesla cars currently on the road. Still more found humor in the situation.
""One lesson I learned from the Shanghai self-exploding Tesla: Don't park your car next to a Tesla,"" said one commentator.
The company is expected to host an Autonomy Day later at its headquarters in Palo Alto, focusing on its autonomous driving system.
In a separate, unrelated incident, Tesla's rival in China, Nio, said in a social media post that an ES8 electric sport utility vehicle caught fire on Monday in a Nio service center in the central city of Xian while under repair. 

""Nio has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire,"" Nio said, adding no one was harmed due to the incident.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 09:12AM ET</span>","Bed Bath & Beyond shakes up board amid investor pressure, co-founders step down","(Reuters) - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY) said it appointed five new independent members to its board, replacing some directors including co-founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, after facing pressure from a trio of activist investors. 
Shares of the New Jersey-based home furnishing retailer rose about 2 percent before the bell. 
Last month, activist investors Legion Partners Asset Management LLC, Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC urged Bed Bath & Beyond to replace its entire board and oust Chief Executive Steven Temares, citing the company's inability to grow sales and margins.
The activist investors own about 5 percent stake in the company. 
Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to keep pace with changing consumer tastes and shopping habits over the years, even after introducing experimental store formats, investing in its decorative furnishing business and digital platforms. 
In its latest results, the retailer forecast dismal first-quarter profits that raised doubts on the efficacy of its turnaround plan.
""The changes announced today reflect significant shareholder input and underscore our commitment to ensuring we have best-in-class governance,"" said Patrick Gaston, who was named an independent chairman. 
The company has also formed a committee to review all aspects of its business transformation, strategy and structure.
Following the changes effective May 1, the board will comprise 10 directors, nine of whom are independent and six women, the company said. 
The activist group was asked to participate in the latest transformation of the board, but it declined the invitation. The company, however, said it remains open to engage in constructive dialogue with the investors.
The three investors were not immediately available for comment. 

Shares of the retailer have risen nearly 26 percent since March 26 when the activist investors demanded changes in the company.

439,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 09:09AM ET</span>",Top cannabis CEOs say Canopy Growth's $3.4 billion purchase of pot cultivator Acreage 'shakes the foundation of what's been true' and will spur a cannabis M&A boom,"The Canadian marijuana behemoth Canopy Growth last week announced it had entered into a conditional agreement to purchase Acreage Holdings, a US pot company, for $3.4 billion pending federal legalization in the US.
Canopy Growth, in other words, is leveraging its Constellation Brands-backed balance sheet to make a huge bet on the US federally legalizing marijuana. 
The structure of Canopy's deal could provide a framework for more of these cross-border mergers, and perhaps pave the way for the biggest consumer, tobacco, and pharmaceutical companies to enter the lucrative US cannabis market and spur a cannabis M&A boom, according to numerous cannabis CEOs, investors, and lawyers.

The deal ""shakes the foundation of what has been true,"" Keith Merker, the CEO of Canadian marijuana cultivator WeedMD told Business Insider in an interview on the sidelines of the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in downtown Toronto's Fairmont Royal York hotel. 
""This deal will absolutely be scrutinized by all industry participants, from the exchanges, to the regulators, to investors,"" said Merker. ""We'll be all over this like a wet blanket.""
Here's how the deal works. Acreage shareholders will receive an immediate $300 million payment in cash, according to sources close to the deal, pending approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia as well as both Canopy and Acreage shareholders. The value of the deal represents a 41% premium over Acreages weighted share price. 
The rest of the money would come as soon as there is a ""federally permissible"" pathway to legalization in the US. That pathway could take the form of the recently reintroduced STATES Act, which would allow states to choose their own route on marijuana legalization (as many have already done), according to Vivien Azer, a cannabis analyst at the investment bank Cowen. The STATES Act, if passed, would also protect banks that want to invest in the industry in states where marijuana is legal.
""There's never been another industry where you've had a federally illegal activity that's legal at the state level, and that is also fully legal in a neighboring country,"" said David Feldman, a partner at the law firm Duane Morris who leads the firm's cannabis practice group and was not involved on the deal. ""This is a very unique set of circumstances — even liquor prohibition was nationwide, there were no exceptions.""
The deal will be terminated in seven years if a federally legal pathway doesn't emerge. And it's not clear what would happen to the $300 million that Canopy Growth paid out up front if the deal doesn't go through.
""We don't yet know what's in the agreement,"" said Feldman. ""It's sort of like waiting for the Mueller report.""
Both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange, where Canopy is dual-listed, do not allow listed companies to invest in or own US cannabis because the drug is federally illegal in the US.
While it's not clear whether the TSX or NYSE will change their policy — spokespeople from both exchanges declined to comment to Business Insider. Johnathan Sherman, a lawyer from the firm Cassels Brock that represented Canopy on the transaction, told Business Insider that the deal was in the works for over eight months and both exchange's regulators had been ""looped in"" to the discussions.

""I don't think this announcement would shock anyone,"" said Sherman, regarding the exchange regulators. And to Sherman, the structure of this deal has the potential to ""untap the market"" for companies that want to pursue US cannabis acquisitions while remaining onside of both federal and stock exchange regulations.
""You're going to see some interest from alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceutical companies that aren't in the space right now because of sensitivity to cannabis generally,"" said Sherman. 
Business Insider previously reported that Canadian cannabis companies had been lobbying the TSX to change exchange regulations to allow them to purchase US assets.
The deal is not without some precedent, however. Canopy Growth has already purchased warrants in Slang Worldwide, a cannabis brand headquartered in Toronto but with operations in a number of US states.
Canopy's deal with Acreage takes a similar deal structure ""to the next level,"" said Slang CEO Peter Miller in an interview. 
""The warrant will allow them to buy the entire company,"" said Miller. Both Slang's and Acreage's deals with Canopy are caveated that they're only exercisable upon a change in federal law, and ""that immediately says right in black and white 'we're not going to do anything that goes offsides what the exchanges will allow,"" said Miller.
""Canopy has just gone bigger than everybody as they do — they don't take small swings,"" said Miller. 
Nicholas Vita, the CEO of Columbia Care, a New York-based medical marijuana company, told Business Insider that this deal is ""very typical of Canopy Growth's behavior to be a first mover.""
""You have large Canadian companies that were essentially boxed out of the US market,"" said Vita. The deal opens up a ""large range of opportunities for consolidation and partnerships.""
Part of what the deal gives Acreage, said Vita, is access to deeper capital markets. Because of the ever-changing regulations in the cannabis industry, there's a quirky setup where US operators like Acreage are forced to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange, a secondary exchange, whereas Canadian operators can tap into premier exchanges like the TSX and NYSE. 
And that access to capital via Canopy's position on both exchanges can help a company like Acreage grow more rapidly by reducing the cost of capital as US marijuana companies fight for market share.
""Ordinarily you don't see a corporation move so far out ahead of the risk curve in advance of a decision,"" said Vita, regarding Canopy's $3.4 billion bet that the US would federally legalize marijuana.

""I'd imagine you're going to see several groups initiate transactions,"" said Vita. ""Maybe not exactly like this, but I'd be surprised if all the large US operators, and all the large global operators aren't having some conversations. It's going to be very rapid.""
But for Acreage's shareholders, like former Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, this could just be a good opportunity to cash out, said Matt Hawkins, a managing partner of the Dallas, Texas-based Cresco Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests in the cannabis industry.
""There's no doubt that this is a shot across the bow to US cannabis companies that Canopy has the war chest to be your exit once [marijuana] becomes legal,"" said Hawkins on the sidelines of the Benzinga conference. 
Hawkins' firm invested in Acreage Holdings before the company went public and still holds shares in the company.
""Canopy is the only company that could do this deal,"" said Hawkins. ""That's why it's so tricky on the public side, because when you've got effectively one company that can come in and gobble up the number one US marijuana company and dictate those terms the way they have, it doesn't make for much of a competitive landscape."""

Pinterest began its IPO road show on Monday with a planned valuation of up to $11.3 billion —notably  below the last private valuation ($12.3 billion) of the company. This could be due to wariness of ""unicorn"" valuations following the choppy trading of Lyft, which is currently below its IPO price.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Ghosn lawyer requests bail after ex-Nissan chairman indicted for fourth time,"By Tim Kelly and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors indicted Carlos Ghosn on Monday on another charge of aggravated breach of trust, a Tokyo court said, the fourth charge against the former Nissan Motor Co Ltd chairman, which his lawyers met immediately with a bail request.
The charge came on the day Ghosn's latest detention period was set to expire. Ghosn had been out on bail when authorities arrested him for a fourth time on April 4 on suspicion he enriched himself at a cost of $5 million to the automaker.
""We are confident that we have the evidence to successfully prosecute all four cases,"" an official from the prosecutor's office said at a briefing after the indictment was announced.
Ghosn has denied all four of the charges, which include understating his income, and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup. He has accused former colleagues of ""backstabbing"", describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between Nissan and its top shareholder, France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
""Carlos Ghosn is innocent of the latest charges brought against him by the Tokyo prosecutors, aided and abetted by certain Nissan conspirators,"" a Ghosn representative said in a statement.
The case has exposed tensions in the Nissan-Renault alliance forged by Ghosn some two decades ago when the French automaker invested in Nissan, then on the brink of bankruptcy - a deal that gave Renault control over its larger partner.
Nissan is due to reject a management integration proposal from Renault and will instead call for an equal capital relationship, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday, citing sources.
Ghosn's arrest has also focused a harsh light on Japan's judicial system, which critics refer to as ""hostage justice"" as defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors are able to hold suspects for up to 22 days without charge and interrogate them without their lawyers present. In accordance with these terms, prosecutors had to indict or release Ghosn by Monday.
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
According to the latest indictment, Ghosn caused a total of $5 million in losses to Nissan from July 2017 through July 2018.
During that period, prosecutors allege two separate payments of $5 million were made from the account of a Nissan subsidiary into the account of an overseas dealership. A total of $5 million was subsequently transferred from the dealership's account to another account in which Ghosn had an interest. 
Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against the former chairman in relation to the matter, saying it had determined that some of its overseas payments had been ordered by Ghosn for his personal enrichment.
The payments were ""not necessary from a business standpoint"", Nissan said in a statement. ""Such misconduct is completely unacceptable, and Nissan is requesting appropriately strict penalties.""
A court would likely rule on the bail request on Tuesday, Ghosn's lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.
Before Ghosn's latest arrest, he had been out on $9 million bail for 30 days. He is now being held in the same Tokyo detention center where he was detained for 108 days following his initial arrest on the tarmac at a Tokyo airport in November.
Kyodo news agency previously reported, without citing sources, that Nissan funds had been shifted through a car dealer in Oman to the account of a company Ghosn effectively owned.
Sources have previously told Reuters that Renault had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering payments it deemed suspect to a partner in Oman.
Evidence sent to French prosecutors showed much of the cash was channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by associates of Ghosn, who holds Lebanese citizenship, the sources told Reuters.

Ghosn's French lawyer denied the allegations.

Elon Musk, the electric vehicle company's chief executive officer, has touted the company's self-driving capabilities over the years, highlighting its semi-autonomous Autopilot system.
Tesla began offering a feature described as ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" in 2016. The company instructs drivers to keep their hands on the wheel when those systems are engaged, sparking some criticism of terms used.
The company's investor day starts at 2 p.m. ET.
Following are the comments made by Musk and Tesla related to the topic in the past few years:
2019

April 3 - Tesla says it is making ""significant progress"" in development of its autonomous driving software and hardware, including the FSD (Full Self-Driving) computer, saying the computer is in production and will enable full-self driving through over-the-air software updates in future.
Feb. 28 – In response to a media question whether it is problematic that Musk uses the term ""full self-driving,"" Musk replies: ""I think we're very clear when you buy the car what is meant by full self-driving. It means it's feature complete. Feature complete requiring supervision ... There's really three steps: feature complete of full self-driving but requiring supervision, feature complete but not requiring supervision, feature complete not requiring supervision and regulators agree.""
2018
Oct. 5 - Tesla introduces software version 9.0 with a number of features including 'Navigate on Autopilot' – intended to guide a car from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, navigating highway interchanges and taking exits that would still require driver supervision [ June 11 - Musk tweets that Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system will get full self-driving features following a software upgrade in August May 23 - Two U.S. consumer advocacy groups urge the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla's ""deceptive and misleading"" use of the name Autopilot for its assisted-driving technology Feb. 2018 - Musk says Tesla can do a coast-to-coast autonomous drive in 3 months, 6 months at most Oct. 19 - Musk says he expects that by the end of 2017 a Tesla would be able to drive in full autonomous mode from Los Angeles to New York ""without the need for a single touch"" on the wheel. [https://reut.rs/2Pk7RYI] Oct. 2016 - Tesla begins to sell a ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" option in its vehicles for $3,000, on top of the $5,000 price for ""Enhanced Autopilot."" Musk says full self-driving features will be rolled out in future via over-the-air updates when available. The option was removed in October 2018, then reinstated in February 2019. Oct 2016 – Musk says all new Teslas built have the hardware required for full self-driving.  2015 
Oct. 15 – Tesla launches an advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot, with Musk cautioning that drivers should keep their hand on the wheel. [https://reut.rs/2VS8gnB]

446,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Beijing Just Undermined China's $2.5 Trillion Stock Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s best performing stock market is suddenly looking a lot more vulnerable after Beijing officials signaled they’re less amenable to adding stimulus.
The CSI 300 Index of equities traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen sank 2.3 percent on Monday, its biggest loss in a month, with five stocks falling for each that rose. Property developers led the plunge, along with companies reliant on consumer discretionary spending and so-called old economy shares such as banks and industrial companies.
After the equity measure surged almost 40 percent this year, investors have grown increasingly sensitive to whether the authorities will maintain the massive scale of stimulus seen in the first quarter. A statement late Friday from a meeting of the Politburo was interpreted by traders as meaning the economy is on a stable enough footing that extended support isn’t needed. Instead there was a focus on deleveraging and avoiding speculation in the housing market.
""People have come to a clear consensus that there won’t be any aggressive stimulus that floods the economy with excessive liquidity, indicating limited room for valuation recovery,"" said Dai Ming, a Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. ""The market is entering a consolidation period that may last one to two months.""
The slump bodes ill for Hong Kong’s equity market, which has been closed since the end of Thursday for holidays and reopens on Tuesday.
China’s stock market has historically been driven by liquidity and momentum traders and any sense that these may dry up could act as a serious overhang. Equities slumped earlier this month amid concern the authorities would act to slow the increase in leverage in the market. The CSI 300 sank 4 percent on March 8 after investors took a rare sell rating from the nation’s largest brokerage as a sign that the government was unhappy about the speed of the rally.
The central bank last week gave a signal that supply of cash would be less liberal, when it rolled over only half of the funds coming due through one of its longer-term policy tools, instead offering more seven-day money.
""The Politburo meeting showed that investors had gotten ahead of themselves,"" said Wang Zhihong, managing director at Whiterock Asset Management Co. The phrasing of the statement, and the implication that real estate may be targeted, has weakened sentiment, he said.
A gauge of property developers in Shanghai tumbled 3.8 percent, its worst performance since March 8, with Gemdale Corp. and China Vanke Co. losing more than 6 percent. Sany Heavy Industry Co., which makes excavators and steam rollers, plunged the most in more than three years. Appliance makers also declined, led by Gree Electric Appliances Inc., which dropped from a record.
To be sure, analysts don’t expect China to shift to a significantly tighter stance, especially with rising pork prices boosting inflation. With the bond market weakening, stocks may still be a preferred alternative. The yield on 10-year government rose to 3.41 percent on Monday, poised for its highest close in five months.
""There is a bit of an overreaction"" in equities, said Gerry Alfonso, director of international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. ""Keeping leverage at reasonable levels will be good for the real economy and in the long term for the stock market.""
But with officials now showing concern about the risk of asset bubbles again, the days of making easy money on the stock market may be nearing an end. China’s equity market has added $2.5 trillion in market value since its low in October, and more than 50 companies on the CSI 300 have risen more than 50 percent this year, meaning there’s a lot of profit for some investors to pocket.
""The market lacks strong momentum to rise further,"" said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. ""Investors are now expecting a shift from unconventional stimulus policies we saw last year to more targeted measures to support the economy.""

447,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Picks Hedges to Deal With Potential Trade Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors should use hedges to mitigate the effect of several trade-event risks, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Trade worries have largely gone into the rear-view mirror this year as stocks have soared and the Federal Reserve turned more dovish. They still can’t be entirely ignored, as U.S.-China talks continue, the approval process for USMCA (the new trade accord between the U.S., Mexico and Canada) gets going and the U.S. contemplates implementing auto tariffs.
READ: Morgan Stanley Cautions Investors to Prepare for Auto Tariffs
“Hedges are a more appropriate way for investors to approach these events rather than wholesale shifts in asset allocation strategy,” Morgan Stanley strategists wrote. “We see the positive outcomes as mostly in the price of the respective markets and the negative outcomes as either unlikely (China, USMCA) or severe-but-temporary (autos/EU).”
READ: GIC Has ‘ Target  (NYSE:TGT) List’ of Stocks to Buy With Trade War Swings
Owning variance on the Euro Stoxx 50 versus that on the S&P 500 would make sense as a hedge for potential auto tariff implementation, according to strategists Andrew Sheets and Serena Tang. That’s because the implied volatility on the European gauge is lower than that of the American one, and that would likely reverse if European Union-U.S. trade tensions increased, they wrote. Their colleague Sheena Shah suggested shorting the euro/Japanese yen cross via options.
For those who own Mexican local assets, strategist Andres Jaime recommends hedges based on the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso for uncertainty over ratification of the USMCA, as peso long positioning looks “stretched.” Morgan Stanley’s base case is for USMCA to be ratified, which would keep the peso stronger because high interest rates are giving the currency a cushion, Jaime said.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2019 11:28AM ET</span>",Strong stock and bond markets at odds over global growth,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It looks like something has to give in global markets. 
Stocks and bonds around the world have rallied atypically together since the start of the year, rewarding investors both bullish and bearish on the direction of global growth.
The main catalyst for the gains was the Federal Reserve's surprise decision in early January to pause its tightening policy, after four interest rate increases in 2018 raised fears it was being too aggressive as the economy cooled and inflation remained minimal. Those fears helped send global markets into a tailspin in December.
Yet with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 near a record level and corporate junk bonds notching new highs, the question stock and bond investors are asking is whether the Fed's next move will be a rate cut that further propels risk assets or a rate hike that cuts into the stock market's momentum. 
A move by the Fed on interest rates or a communication misstep by the central bank would likely end either the rally in the stock market or in investment-grade bonds by the end of the year, restoring the traditional give-and-take between risk and safety, investors say. 
""The Fed is between a rock and a hard place,"" said Kathleen Gaffney, a portfolio manager at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Management in Boston. ""They can't go lower because there are signs that inflation is rising and they can't go higher because of global political uncertainty. It leaves the market on pause."" 
The U.S. central bank has said it will soon stop letting bonds bought during its ""quantitative easing"" period following the financial crisis roll off its balance sheet, which also helped push yields on safe havens like Treasuries lower and acted as a tailwind for riskier assets.
Gaffney said the Fed will likely have to raise rates again because of rising wages and other forms of inflation by the end of the year, adding that such a move will ""pierce"" the high valuations in both the stocks and bond markets. 
TWIN RALLY
The rolling four-month percentage change in the price of the S&P 500 and the 10-Year Treasury note have both been positive for three straight months, according to a Reuters analysis. That is the longest such streak since a five-month run that ended in August 2017, it showed.
In that same 2017 period, the S&P 500 gained and 10-year Treasury yields fell as the market digested conflicting economic reports during the first year of the Trump administration, before the Federal Reserve in September began quantitative tightening that resulted in bond yields rising as the S&P 500 continued to rally. 
Since January equity markets around the world have made up much of the ground they lost during a wrenching fourth quarter of 2018 that sent the U.S. stock market to the brink of a bear market. 
The S&P 500 and Europe's STOXX 600 are up almost 16% year to date, while stock indexes in China are up nearly 30%.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) Merrill Lynch U.S. high yield index is up 8.6% year to date while the Merrill Lynch World sovereign bond index is up almost 1.5%. 
World stocks vs bonds - https://tmsnrt.rs/2IrqXeF
A rally in benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, usually seen as a safe haven, undercuts the picture of a ""risk on"" market. Their yields have slid from 2.69% at the start of the year to as low as 2.34% in late March. 
""At this point in the cycle, equity investors are trying to take any incremental news positively while fixed income investors are not,"" said Jen Robertson, a portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management in London. ""It's quite delicate at the moment and any negative news out of first quarter earnings could impact this sharp bounce."" 
Further uncertainty due to the economic impact of the UK leaving the European Union, which has now been pushed back to Oct. 31, or a deterioration in U.S.-China trade talks could be a ""shock to the system"" and derail both stocks and bonds, she said. 
The spread between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes turned negative for the first time since 2007 in March, a bearish sign as a yield curve inversion has signaled an upcoming economic recession in the past. 
The move initially boosted stock prices as investors predicted it would hem the Fed in from future interest rate hikes. But equities could fall soon if recession fears continue to grow, said Hiroaki Hayashi, managing director of Fukoku Capital Management in Tokyo.
""If you look at the past experiences, share prices have often rallied six to nine months after the yield curve initially inverted before entering a major correction. I believe we are exactly at such a phase now.""
Despite outsized gains this year, financial markets have not indicated investors have faith that the global economy can grow without historically low interest rates a decade after the end of the Great Recession, said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. 
""The bull market we've had for the past 10 years is essentially because of really low interest rates,"" Bahuguna said. 

""I don't think that equilibrium will last much longer,"" she added, saying rising inflation and low unemployment could soon test global markets' ability to cope with tighter monetary policy.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2019 09:08AM ET</span>",Financial market 'pause party' makes Fed rate cut less likely,"By Howard Schneider and Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Risk-taking has been the rage since the Federal Reserve quit hiking interest rates at the end of last year. U.S. stocks are back near record highs and investors are stockpiling the lowest-grade corporate bonds with only a smidgen of extra compensation for the added risk.
That rebounding mood on Wall Street may be welcomed by a president that has been demanding the Fed cut rates after markets fell sharply last year, and complaining that even pausing at the current level is the wrong call.
But if anything the 'pause party' on Wall Street makes it even less likely that the U.S. central bank will cut rates. Recent positive news on retail sales and exports, which have eased concerns of a sharply slowing economy, makes the case for a rate cut even weaker.
Investors at least have gotten the message, and shifted from projecting a rate cut later this year to now putting the odds at only 50-50 that the Fed will move lower by early 2020.
Wall Street celebrates the Fed's 'pause https://tmsnrt.rs/2VRQYqp
The state of financial markets, say some analysts, is evidence the Fed's rate increases last year were on point, allowing the economy to continue growing while keeping risks in check. A rate cut at this stage would only be courting problems.
“The argument for why they should keep the possibility of a rate hike on the table is because of financial stability,” Citi chief economist Catherine Mann said in remarks on Wednesday to a conference on financial stability at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College.
After a decade of near zero interest rates, “moving toward a constellation of asset prices that embodies risks is critical for getting us to a more stable financial market,” she said, noting that both equity prices and low-grade bond yields show a market that remains too sanguine. 
In their critiques of the Fed, U.S. President Donald Trump, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and possible Fed nominee Stephen Moore have argued that lower rates would allow faster growth and be in line with Trump’s economic plans. They contend that, with the risk of inflation low, the central bank does not need to maintain 'insurance' against it by keeping rates where they are.
     Overlooked in that analysis are the financial stability concerns steadily integrated into Fed policymaking since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. Mann spoke at a conference named in honor of economist Hyman Minsky, who explored how financial excess can build during good times, and unwind in catastrophic fashion. The downturn a decade ago showed just how deeply that dynamic can scar the real economy.
     Financial stability isn’t a formal mandate for the Fed, which under congressional legislation is supposed to maintain the twin goals of maximum employment and stable prices. But since the crisis the central bank has concluded that keeping financial markets on an even keel is a necessary condition for achieving the other two aims. 
    That doesn’t mean an end of volatility or a guarantee of profits, but rather that risks are properly priced and that the use of leverage – investments made with borrowed money – is kept within safe limits.
Keeping an eye on stock valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr6u5z
     That's a key reason why even policymakers focused on maintaining high levels of employment, like Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, at times have taken on a hawkish tone in favor of rate increases. The worse outcome for workers, Rosengren and others have said, would be to let markets inflate too much, and crash again, even if that means risking a bit higher unemployment in the interim.  
Markets are currently ""a little rich,"" Rosengren said in recent remarks at Davidson College in North Carolina. 
Though not enough to warrant a rate increase, he said, it does argue against a rate reduction. Overall, Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell say they feel financial risks are within a manageable range, something policymakers feel has been helped along by the rate increases to date. 
The state of financial markets is ""something that the Fed has to wrestle with,"" Rosengren said. ""It's appropriate for interest rates to be paused right now.""

In an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, Fink warned, however, that the global economy was in the late stage of a long growth cycle, suggesting that downturn was becoming more likely. 
""I see no signs of a global recession in the coming 12 months,"" said Fink, who leads the world's largest asset manager.
""The central banks have loosened their policy above all because of the weak fourth quarter of 2018. We will go through a phase in which things are not great but also not bad.""
He added: ""But we are naturally in a late phase of the economic growth cycle.""
The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 this month and said growth could slow further due to unresolved trade disputes and the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
The global lender said some major economies, including China and Germany, might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth and that a severe downturn could require coordinated stimulus measures.

German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has ruled out taking on new debt to stimulate growth in Europe's biggest economy, saying tax cuts, higher investments and a solid labor market will continue to provide growth impetus.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2019 02:49AM ET</span>",U.S. intelligence says Huawei funded by Chinese state security: report,"(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence has accused Huawei Technologies of being funded by Chinese state security, The Times said on Saturday, adding to the list of allegations faced by the Chinese technology company in the West.
The CIA accused Huawei of receiving funding from China's National Security Commission, the People's Liberation Army and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network, the British newspaper reported, citing a source.
Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence shared its claims with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, which includes Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the report Huawei dismissed the allegations in a statement cited by the newspaper. ""Huawei does not comment on unsubstantiated allegations backed up by zero evidence from anonymous sources,"" a Huawei representative told The Times. The company, the CIA and China's Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The accusation comes at a time of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and amid concerns in the United States that Huawei's equipment could be used for espionage. The company has said the concerns are unfounded.  Authorities in the United States are probing Huawei for alleged sanctions violations. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. She denies wrongdoing and her father has previously said the arrest was ""politically motivated"".  Amid such charges, top educational institutions in the West have recently severed ties with Huawei to avoid losing federal funding.  Another Chinese technology company, ZTE Corp (HK:0763) 0763.HK, 000063.SZ, has also been at the center of similar controversies in the United States. U.S. sanctions forced ZTE to stop most business between April and July last year after Commerce Department officials said it broke a pact and was caught illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea. The sanctions were lifted after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties. Reuters reported earlier this week that the United States will push its allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks. (This version of the story clarifies in sixth paragraph that China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to request for comment)

The student, Liu Jingyao, from China, filed a civil lawsuit against JD's CEO in a Minneapolis court on Tuesday, nearly four months after prosecutors declined to press criminal charges against him.
The law suit identified the student for the first time. The two Lius are not related.
Richard Liu, through his lawyers, maintained his innocence throughout the law enforcement investigation, which ended in December. The company did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
It was unclear who launched the petition, which carried the hashtag #HereForJingyao, although signatories included Chinese students at foreign universities as well as in China. On Saturday, it was gathering momentum on the social media platform WeChat, with more than 500 names attached.
""To Liu Jingyao: You are not alone. We believe in survivors, we believe in your bravery and honesty, we will always stand with you. We must join hands and march together in the face of the challenge of a culture of blaming the victims of rape,"" the petition said.
A Chinese-language translation of the indictment was also circulating online.
Liu Jingyao first accused Richard Liu of rape in August when he was visiting the University of Minnesota to attend a program directed at executives from China.
Liu, 46, who started JD.com as a humble electronics stall and expanded it into an e-commerce company with 2018 net revenues of $67 billion, was arrested on Aug. 31 but released without charge about 17 hours later.
A fledgling #MeToo-style movement in support of women's rights has been slow to gain wide traction in China, where issues like sexual assault have traditionally been brushed under the carpet.

China's ruling Communist Party, wary about grassroots organizing, has also in recent months put pressure on activists focused on issues like sexual assault on campuses and workers' rights.

Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson, and Linda Johnson Rice will not be standing for re-election in the upcoming annual meetings of stockholders in 2019 and 2020, the company said https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459019012123/tsla-8k_20190418.htm in a regulatory filing. 
The company said its directors reviewed the composition of the board ""focusing on a phased streamlining of the size of the Board to allow it to operate more nimbly and efficiently.""
Tesla said the decision did not result from any disagreement between the company and the directors.
Of the four members who would exit the board, Buss and Gracias were part of Tesla's disclosure controls committee, overseeing the implementation of the terms of the consent agreement between Tesla and the SEC. 
Buss was also the chief financial officer of solar panel installer SolarCity for two years before retiring in 2016. Tesla bought SolarCity that year. 
Gracias has been an independent director at Tesla since 2010. Last May, proxy adviser ISS recommended that investors vote against his election to the board and called him a non-independent director. 
Jurvetson, the co-founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is said to be on a leave of absence from Tesla's board since allegations of sexual harassment against him arose. Jurvetson has denied the allegations against him. (https://reut.rs/2mn57in)
The proposed changes in the board come a couple of weeks after Elon Musk's position as the chief executive officer of Tesla was secured after a federal judge urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter.
Musk was sued by the SEC last year for tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private. He settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company. 
But he was again accused of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. 
On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Musk and the SEC would get another week to settle a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that a joint governmental review of the now grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX will begin on April 29 and will include 9 other aviation regulators from around the world.
The FAA said earlier this month it was forming an international team to review the safety of the aircraft, grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - that killed nearly 350 people.
Boeing has announced a planned software update on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system known as MCAS that is under scrutiny following the two disastrous nose-down crashes. It has not yet submitted the software to the FAA for formal approval.
China, the European Aviation Safety Agency, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates will all take part, the FAA said, in the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) that is set to last 90 days, the FAA said. Most of the countries previously confirmed they would take part.
The JATR is chaired by former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Chris Hart and is comprised of a team of experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities. The group will conduct a comprehensive review of the certification of the aircraft’s automated flight control system.
The team will evaluate aspects of the 737 MAX automated flight control system, including design and pilots’ interaction with the system, ""to determine its compliance with all applicable regulations and to identify future enhancements that might be needed,"" the FAA said.
Hart told reporters earlier this month the review is in response ""to the growing need for globalization ... because these airplanes are all over the place"" and to the need for a “uniform response.""
American Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co have canceled flights into August as a result of the grounding.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday the manufacturer is making ""steady progress"" on the path to certifying a software update to the grounded 737 MAX and has made the final test flight before a certification flight.

NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and private realty firm Crown Acquisitions said on Friday they were the unnamed investors in a deal with  Vornado Realty  Trust (NYSE:VNO) valued at $5.56 billion that involves a portfolio of prime New York retail properties.
Vornado sold a non-controlling stake in its portfolio of properties along Fifth Avenue and Broadway in Times Square (NYSE:SQ) in a transaction that provided the firm cash proceeds of about $1.2 billion, the firm said on Thursday. 
Neither QIA, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, or Crown Acquisitions were named on Thursday as the investors who contributed $1.31 billion in cash in a newly created joint venture with Vornado. 
QIA and Crown Acquisitions, which acted as an advisor to the deal, said they acquired a 24% stake each in a portfolio of five ground-level stores along a swath of Fifth Avenue just north of St. Patrick's Cathedral and two sites in Times Square.
The deal comprised $950 million of mortgage debt, $1.83 billion of preferred equity entirely held by Vornado and $2.78 billion of common equity in which Vornado holds 51%. 
The portfolio include stores at 666 Fifth Avenue, a building that has been in the news because it was owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, until Brookfield Asset Management bought a 99-year lease on the office portion last August. 
QIA Chief Executive Mansoor al-Mahmoud said in a statement the investment underlined QIA's ambition to boost its U.S. investments to $45 billion in coming years and ""our belief in the exciting long-term possibilities offered by New York City.""
The retail portfolio includes such brands as MAC, Polo, Forever 21 and Disney.
QIA also is an investor in Brookfield and the transaction at 666 Fifth Avenue involving Kushner Cos had prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via the sovereign wealth fund, two sources told Reuters earlier this year.
Qatar had decided that QIA would aim to avoid investing in funds or other vehicles it does not fully control, according to the sources, who are familiar with the strategy. 
Qatar, whose wealth comes from the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas, manages about $300 billion in assets.
Mahmoud told Reuters in December the fund was focusing on ""classic"" investments in the West such as real estate and financial institutions, and would also accelerate investment in technology and healthcare.
With oil and gas prices growing over the past two years, Qatar has not departed from what it is best known for - snapping up big-name properties.

The preliminary findings by the trade panel mean the U.S. Commerce Department will move ahead with an investigation into whether Chinese wooden cabinets, vanities and components are unfairly subsidized or sold in the U.S. market at less than fair value.
If the Commerce Department determines the products are unfairly subsidized or dumped on the U.S. market, and the ITC upholds its finding of harm, the United States would impose tariffs on the imports for a period of five years.
The United States imported some $4.4 billion worth of wooden cabinets, vanities and their components from China in 2018. The trade investigation was launched in March based on petitions from the American Kitchen Cabinet Alliance.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Will the Benettons use Alitalia to fly in from the cold?,"By Giselda Vagnoni, Francesca Landini and Stefano Bernabei
MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Italian transport group Atlantia could join a rescue of loss-making flag carrier Alitalia to try to win favor with the government and secure the future of its own domestic business following a deadly bridge collapse last year, sources said.
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, faces the loss of its entire national motorway concession in a bitter dispute with the government, which erupted after last year's disaster on its toll network killed 43 people.
The government blamed Atlantia for the tragedy, saying it had failed to adequately maintain the aging bridge, and vowed to revoke the concession, worth 58 percent of group revenue.
However, sources familiar with the matter said Atlantia could mend relations with the government by joining a rescue of Alitalia, which Rome is desperate to save, and possibly be rewarded with a reprieve on its motorway concession.
Atlantia has publicly scoffed at the idea, but sources say it stands ready if Rome signals a quid pro quo is possible. The government has not given such a signal but a political source says it may do if it sees Atlantia as key to saving Alitalia.
Atlantia, which also runs Alitalia's main airport hub in Rome, has denied it is in talks to join a rescue consortium, saying its hands are already full with complex business challenges, including the fate of its motorway concession.
However, a source familiar with the flag-carrier's thinking said Alitalia expected Atlantia to sign up to a rescue as early as this month. The source did not elaborate.
Atlantia declined to comment for this article.
Another potential investor in the rescue bid, state-owned rail group Ferrovie dello Stato, which has had initial talks with Atlantia, also believes the Benetton-controlled group could yet be tempted to join, said a source familiar with those talks.
""Atlantia's door is not closed ... it is now up to the government to take the lead in the talks,"" said a second source familiar with Alitalia's thinking.
Alitalia, put into special administration in 2017 after workers rejected a previous rescue plan, needs to find investors ready to inject fresh funds by the end of April, in advance of an end-June repayment deadline for a state bridging loan of 900 million euros. That loan, however, may be rolled over, daily Il Sole 24 Ore said.
The government, formed by the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, is keen to save the airline because it wants to avoid mass layoffs at Alitalia, which has around 11,600 employees.
However, political sources said it was still unclear whether the ruling coalition, especially the 5-Star party, would be ready to make such a peace with Atlantia. The party was the most critical of Atlantia after the bridge collapse.
""For 5-Star even the hypothesis of freezing the procedure for revoking the concession is not politically sustainable,"" said a senior 5-Star source.
The prime minister's office did not reply to a request for comment.
CLOCK TICKING
Ferrovie and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are looking to invest in Alitalia but they still need to find other investors to stump up another 400 million euros for a rescue worth a total of around 1 billion euros, sources close to the talks said.
Ferrovie and its adviser, investment bank Mediobanca, have discreetly sounded out Atlantia after being turned down by a string of other companies.
Reuters was unable to immediately reach a Delta spokeswoman.
Atlantia has been burned by Alitalia once before, having lost 190 million euros when it participated in a rescue in 2008.
""We have many open fronts, we can't afford to open a further, particularly complex one,"" Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci said on Thursday, speaking to shareholders.
In addition to the bridge disaster, Castellucci said he was also dealing with the government over its lengthy approvals process which was blocking 4.9 billion euros in group projects.
Some financial analysts say a quid pro quo would make sense.
""We reckon a possible agreement over Alitalia would be positive for Atlantia, because it would lead to a rapprochement with the government,"" broker Equita said in a note this week.
For now, Ferrovie is ready to take a 30 percent stake in Alitalia, Delta Air Lines would invest 100 million euros for a stake of 10-15 percent and another 15 percent would probably go to the Italian treasury, sources familiar with the matter say.
But there is still a question mark over who would take the remaining 40-45 percent of the carrier. 
British budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) walked away from talks with Ferrovie last month, state-controlled defense group Leonardo and postal operator Poste Italiane said they were not interested in the deal.

If Ferrovie and Delta cannot find co-investors, Rome would face its least favored option: a takeover by German carrier Lufthansa which has said it would only rescue Alitalia if the government were first to carry out major job cuts.

""We have already provided jobs to more than 100 pilots, more than 200 cabin crew and more than 200 technical and airport staff,"" said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of SpiceJet. ""We will do more."" 
Hundreds of Jet Airways employees protested in Delhi and Mumbai on Thursday to push its management for answers about their future after the airline shut down all flight operations on Wednesday having failed to secure new funding from its lenders. 
Jet Airways has lost many employees as the crisis unfolded. About 400 pilots have moved to other airlines, leaving Jet with about 1,300 pilots, a senior Jet pilot told Reuters. About 40 engineers have also left, a senior engineer said.
Lenders, led by State Bank Of India, say they are hopeful of a successful bidding process for Jet. The carrier is saddled with about $1.2 billion in debt. 
Low cost carrier SpiceJet, which pledged to add 27 planes over the next two weeks to help to fill in the slots left vacant by Jet's grounding, said that it is making all possible efforts to minimize passenger inconvenience. The government plans to form a committee to temporarily allocate takeoff and landing slots left vacant by the grounding of Jet's flights, a senior official said on Thursday. Local airlines including InterGlobe Aviation Ltd and state-run Air India are likely to benefit. 

Air India on Thursday offered special fares to passengers stranded in international routes due to Jet's grounding.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Electric vehicle (EV) concepts shown in Shanghai this week, such as the Audi AI:me and Infiniti QX Inspiration, point to a future of living-room-like comfort in cars with flat floors and ample space for sofa-like bench seats. 
In the design studies, automakers have taken advantage of the space freed up by the electric motor, which takes less room than the bulky internal combustion engine, cooling apparatus and complex transmission gears needed for gasoline cars. 
As most batteries in an EV are laid out flat under the floor, the EVs shown in the Shanghai auto show, which started on Tuesday, also have more height and, in fact, many are sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
Both the AI:me urban car and Infiniti's QX Inspiration SUV have flat floors, interiors large enough to accommodate what looks like a sofa in the back and more leg room and storage. 
Because there is no tunnel, which often houses the drive shaft and exhaust apparatus in a gasoline car, running through the length of the EV cabin, the center of the rear seat ""can become just as valuable"" as the space on its sides, design chief for Nissan's premium brand Infiniti, Karim Habib, said.
That in turn points to the possibility of ""a return of the bench seat"" in the front and the rear - a throwback to American cars of a bygone era, Habib told Reuters.
The EV's flat and slightly elevated floor allows passengers to slide into it, Habib said. ""You can kind of comfortably sit into it ... You can cross your legs, stretch your legs out,"" he added, referring to the QX Inspiration concept car.
Audi's AI:me offers what the company's China operations chief, Thomas Owsianski, described as ""maximum space comfort"" despite its smallish urban car profile. 

""We are fundamentally changing the perception of a (urban) car, particularly car experience,"" Owsianski said in Shanghai on Monday. ""The AI:me has very compact dimensions but ... it shows the urban mobility, especially premium mobility, doesn't need to feel small. Cars are becoming a living room space.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Friday it is recalling more than 320,000 Dodge Dart compact cars in North America that could roll away because of a defective part that could allow the shift cable to detach from the transmission.
The Italian-American automaker said the recall covers 2013 through 2016 model year automatic transmission Dart cars and that the defect could prevent drivers from shifting vehicles into park. The company said it is not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the issue but has several thousand reports of related repairs to vehicles. The company said a cable bushing may degrade after prolonged exposure to high ambient heat and humidity.
The company said owners should make sure they shut off the vehicle and engage the parking brake. Fiat Chrysler will replace the transmission side shifter cable bushing, the company said. 
The company did not said when repairs will be ready.
The recall covers about 298,000 U.S. vehicles, 20,117 in Canada, 3,400 in Mexico and about 900 outside of North America.
Fiat Chrysler ended production of the Dart in 2016.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2019 07:57AM ET</span>",Mir card payment system looks beyond Russia,"By Tatiana Voronova and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
MOSCOW (Reuters) - After Western sanctions gutted Russia's financial system five years ago, a new bank card began appearing in the wallets of many Russians.
Now the country is hoping to introduce its cards, known as Mir cards, to foreign markets where Russian nationals live and travel, Vladimir Komlev, the head of Russia's National Card Payment System (NSPK), told Reuters in an interview. 
""In the next three years we want Mir cards to be operational in countries where Russians are used to traveling,"" Komlev said. ""It's the hardest task in terms of returns on investment.""
Russia created its own card payment system in 2014 because it feared U.S. and European sanctions against some Russian banks and businesspeople over the annexation of Crimea could block transactions made with U.S.-based Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V).
NSPK said Turkey's Isbank had started accepting Mir cards as of Thursday. Russians made 5.7 million trips to Turkey last year, according to state statistics agency Rosstat.
Komlev projected Mir cards would be operational at some banks in 12 foreign countries by the end of the year. He would not, however, disclose which countries those might be.
NSPK is not subject to Western sanctions, but some foreign companies are wary of doing business with Russian firms in case further restrictions are put in place.
EXPANDING AT HOME 
More than 56 million Mir cards have been issued and they currently make up more than 20 percent of Russia's bank card market, Komlev said. 
Mir means ""World"" or ""Peace"" in Russian. 
NSPK, which was created by the central bank, has received a boost from legislation obliging civil servants to receive their salaries on Mir cards. It aims for Mir cards' share of the market to reach 30 percent over the next couple of years. 
Starting next year, pension payments, as well as child and unemployment benefits, will only be paid on the cards.
These measures have made Mir a rival to Mastercard and Visa in Russia. But its shortcomings - its incompatibility with many international shopping platforms and its limited use outside Russia - have prompted Russian officials to call for more support to help it to take on U.S. competitors.
""At this time, it's difficult for Mir to compete with Visa and Mastercard,"" Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said this month. ""We need to develop its functionality, its social orientation.""
Mastercard, which operates a co-branded card with Mir, said it ""supported the development of the payment industry and fair competition."" Visa did not reply to a request for comment.
Mir has develop its own ""Mir Pay"" smartphone application and is available on Samsung (KS:005930) Pay. Komlev said NSPK had not reached an agreement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make Mir cards available on its mobile payment platform. 
Komlev said another of NSPK's priorities was to get major international online booking services for airline tickets and accommodation to accept Mir cards. 

""Business and geopolitics have mixed here, so it's not as easy to implement as we would like,"" he said.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2019 07:01AM ET</span>",Nissan slams output cut report as 'completely incorrect',"(Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Friday a report by the Nikkei that it would slash production this year was ""completely incorrect"" and that it had lodged a complaint with the business daily, in an unusually strong denial of a media report in Japan.
The comment came after the Nikkei, revered in Japan for its business news and known for its market-moving scoops and previews, said Nissan would cut its global production by about 15 percent for the current fiscal year ending March 2020.
The move would mark a shift away from the aggressive expansion campaign promoted by ousted former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the Nikkei said.
""The details reported in this story are completely incorrect, and Nissan has voiced its strong objection to the Nikkei,"" the Japanese automaker said in a statement posted on its website.
""Nissan's production plan for the current fiscal year will be disclosed on May 14, when the company announces its financial results for the previous fiscal year,"" said the maker of the Rogue sport-utility vehicle and Altima sedan.
The Nikkei, which also owns Britain's Financial Times newspaper, confirmed it had received the complaint from Nissan. It said it would continue to cover the issue and promptly report all the facts once they become clear. 
The newspaper had earlier reported that Nissan aimed to produce about 4.6 million units in fiscal 2019, citing plans being communicated to the automaker's suppliers. The move was likely to impact earnings and could cast a pall over Nissan's alliance with French automaker  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), the Nikkei said without elaborating.
That would be the steepest production cut in more than a decade by the Japanese automaker, as it battles weak sales in overseas markets including the United States where it plans to scale back sales operations, according to the Nikkei.
Earlier this year, Nissan, which has been battling falling sales, lowered its operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year to 450 billion yen ($4 billion), 22 percent lower than a year earlier. It would be Nissan's lowest profit since 2013.
Japanese companies typically respond to media reports by saying they were not the source of the information and, depending on the content of the report, that they may be considering various options and that nothing had been decided.
It is rare for a Japanese firm to say it has issued a strong rebuke to a media outlet.
Shares in Nissan, mired in a financial misconduct scandal involving Ghosn and the company itself, closed down 2.2 percent on Friday, versus a 0.5 percent rise in the broader market.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil refiners are planning a heavy slate of plant overhauls in the second quarter, with total production this month off 8.5 percent compared with the start of the year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Early spring and winter traditionally are heavy periods for U.S. refinery maintenance. But refiners are planning more upgrades than usual in the first half of 2019 to avoid fall and winter shutdowns as they prepare to meet coming low-sulfur standards.
This year's maintenance schedule and higher crude prices helped push U.S. gasoline prices to a national average of $2.83 a gallon last week, up 26 percent since the start of the year, according to data from the American Automobile Association. U.S. crude futures rose 32 percent in the first quarter. 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 is a standard for maritime diesel that takes effect on Jan. 1 and is designed to reduce air pollution. Refiners have been revamping their plants to make IMO 2020 compliant fuel. 
""They will push (winter) turnarounds later into 2020 to take advantage of that margin bump from the switch to IMO 2020,"" said Susan Bell, a senior associate at energy consultancy IHS Markit.
Most U.S. refiners typically ramp up production of motor fuel during the second quarter to build inventories for the summer driving season. But Bell said an average of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil refining capacity could be offline through the second quarter.
Work on refiners' crude distillation units (CDUs) and catalytic crackers helped send volumes down to 15.85 million bpd in the last week of March, from 17.5 million bpd in the first week of January, the EIA said. CDUs generate feedstocks for fuel processing units such as catalytic crackers. 
Among the refiners scheduling major maintenance this month are  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc. Valero's Memphis, Tennessee, refinery will shut its 65,000 bpd gasoline producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit for a 60-day overhaul the last week of April. 
BP is shutting one of two small CDUs at its 413,500 bpd Whiting, Indiana, refinery on Monday for 30 days of work. The Whiting refinery is BP's largest in North America. 
Work also is continuing this month on a planned overhaul of the 112,000 bpd gasoline-producing residual catalytic cracking unit at Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's 218,200 bpd Norco, Louisiana, refinery. That unit is expected to restart in the first full week of May.
Two other major overhauls finished during the switchover between the quarters.

 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) recently finished CDU overhauls at two plants: its 560,500 bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery wrapped up work on its largest CDU in late March and the company's 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery restarted its second-largest crude unit on Monday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura Holdings has no plan to follow the lead of Wall Street rivals and seek a tie-up with a commercial lender, its chief executive told Reuters, pledging to stay independent even as the investment bank faces its first annual loss in a decade.
Nomura in January reported a net loss of more than 101 billion yen ($903 million) in the first three quarters of the year to end-March. It has since announced an overhaul plan to cut $1 billion in cost from its wholesale business and close more than 30 of its 156 retail branches. 
But it will not seek to join forces with a commercial bank, Koji Nagai said, eschewing a model that has reshaped Wall Street since the financial crisis and has seen  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) tie up with Japan's biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
""We can do a deal with any partner if we make the effort. We don't belong to any banking group and that is our strength,"" Nagai told Reuters in an interview this week embargoed for release on Friday.
Even without capital ties to any of Japan's three megabanks - Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group - Nomura has been able to retain its formidable presence in Japanese investment banking, particularly deals.
It is advising Nippon Paint Holdings on a $2.7 billion bid for Australia's DuluxGroup, announced this week. 
But it doesn't have the lending firepower of a rival such as Morgan Stanley, which thanks to its tie-up with Mitsubishi UFJ, has been able to leverage the Japanese bank's massive balance sheet to offer financing alongside of advisory services.
ENVY & INDEPENDENCE
Nagai said that while he felt ""envy"" toward competitors with lending power, a capital alliance with one of the megabanks would sacrifice Nomura's independence - likely closing it off from clients allied to one of the other megabanks, given the Japanese corporate practice of sticking to a ""main bank"" and doing business with that lender's affiliates.
""We won't give up our independence by joining a capital alliance,"" he said.
As part of the cost-cutting overhaul Nomura also plans to axe about 100 jobs in London, the center for its European banking business, Reuters has previously reported.
The wholesale business has been squeezed by lower trading revenue in fixed income. 
Credit-ratings firm Moody's has said that Nomura's overhaul plans, if successful, would help it refocus its business and reduce earnings volatility.
Nagai said Nomura is also focused on driving its mass-affluent customers - often defined as those with less than $1 million in investable assets - to its digital platform. The bank is looking to hire people from online brokerages to help drive that strategy, he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Embattled Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has denied accusations of embezzlement and financial irregularity made by a rival group of shareholders in Hong Kong Airlines (HKA) as the two sides fight for control of the struggling carrier.
The allegations were made by Zhong Guosong and Frontier Investment Partner who between them control 61 percent of HKA's shares. On Tuesday, they declared they had taken control of the carrier and made Zhong, a former HKA director, chairman after an extraordinary shareholder meeting.
The pair said on Wednesday, via a spokesperson, that an investigation had been launched into ""the embezzlement of HKA assets and serious financial misappropriation by HNA Group parties.""
In an emailed statement to Reuters on Friday, HNA said that the allegations ""are false"".
""HNA Group is committed to the highest standards of integrity in all of its activities and expects the same of all of its representatives,"" it added. 
HKA's website still lists Hou Wei as chairman. 
Hou joined HKA in September last year after more than four years with HNA-controlled Hainan Airlines, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. 
HNA holds about 29 percent of HKA, having cut its majority holding two years ago.
This week's battle comes as HKA is struggling to survive. Earlier this month, airline executives told shareholders the company needed at least HK$2 billion ($254.95 million) to avoid the risk of losing its operating license - and that it swung to a loss of about HK$3 billion last year.
Zhong and Frontier representatives at that meeting, however, demanded details of the 2018 accounts and questioned the close ties between HKA and HNA affiliates, which include loans and equity investments by HKA to HNA groups, according to HKA's 2017 accounts seen by Reuters.
On Thursday this week, the two sides clashed again when Zhong and Frontier accused HNA of storming HKA's head offices and removing documents - claims denied by an HKA spokesperson.
HKA said later that day that the extra security staff visible in the lobby and foyer of HKA's offices were to preserve order that had been disrupted by the shareholder dispute. 
On Thursday evening, Hong Kong's Transport and Housing Bureau said it had met with representatives for both sides and was monitoring the situation. 
It added that the Civil Aviation Department had stepped up its oversight of HKA's flight operations to ensure no disruption over the holiday weekend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will get another week to settle a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter, a federal judge ruled Thursday. 
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan extended the deadline by one week to April 25, in response to a Thursday court filing where both sides requested the extension and said ""discussions are ongoing."" 
Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet that the SEC said violated an earlier settlement with the agency.
If Musk and the agency fail to resolve the dispute, the judge said she would rule on the contempt request. 
The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk's privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.
Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company, including tweets.
In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.
Musk's lawyers have argued that the tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.
At an April 4 hearing, a lawyer for the SEC said that if Musk were found in contempt, the agency would ask the judge to require him to submit regular reports about his Twitter use, and to pay a series of progressively higher fines for any future violations.
Nathan declined to rule on the contempt motion at the hearing, instead ordering Musk and Tesla to meet and try to resolve the dispute on their own.
Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. He has been chief executive of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.
The Palo Alto, California-based company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.
The Feb. 19 tweet that prompted the SEC's contempt motion said: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" meaning 500,000 vehicles.
Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be ""probably around"" 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.
The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.
Musk's lawyers have argued that the first tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.
Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission.""

In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight.""

That is the biggest percentage gain since July 2016, when enthusiasm for Nintendo-backed smartphone game Pokemon Go sent the stock rocketing. Friday's jump sent the shares to their highest price since October and pushed the year-to-date gain to 32 percent.
Nintendo's U.S.-listed shares rose 12 percent overnight after the Chinese province of Guangdong allowed Tencent to distribute the Switch console with a test version of the ""New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe"" game.
It remains unknown when the console may go on sale in China, with games needing to clear a separate approval process.
Gaming industry leader Tencent is trying to recover from a lengthy game approval freeze in China last year. The firm is listed in Hong Kong, where financial markets are closed on Friday for a public holiday.
The freeze resulted in a backlog which ""means it is uncertain whether a strong line-up of launch titles can coincide with the hardware launch,"" said market analyst Gu Tianyi at gaming industry analytics firm Newzoo.
Tencent is likely to release its own popular titles such as Honor of Kings on the Switch in China, he said. The international version of the game, Arena of Valor, is available overseas on the Switch. 
With China dominated by PC and mobile gaming, analysts hope the news may lead to Tencent and Nintendo teaming up in mobile, where Nintendo has been expanding its range of partnerships.
The Kyoto-based games maker has previously been hampered by Chinese regulations and the search for a partner in its efforts to bring the hybrid home-portable Switch console to China, holding back the development of console gaming there.

Nintendo shares sold off toward the end of last year over concerns about weakness in its Switch games pipeline. Media reports saying Nintendo will launch a low-price Switch version have helped bolster sentiment in recent weeks.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 10:13PM ET</span>",National Enquirer to be sold to owner of magazine distributor,"(Reuters) - American Media Inc (AMI) said on Thursday it was selling its National Enquirer tabloid to James Cohen, whose family owns a magazine distributor and used to own the Hudson chain of airport newsstands.
The National Enquirer had admitted to paying hush money to help U.S. President Donald Trump get elected and been accused of attempting to blackmail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The weekly tabloid, along with two of its sister publications, will be purchased by Cohen. The Washington Post reported the sale was for $100 million. The companies did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on the price.
Cohen's family owns a U.S. magazine and book distributor, Hudson News Distributors. In 2008, the family sold the airport retail and newsstand business to Dufry AG.
The deal comes a week after AMI said it was looking at ""strategic options"" for the National Enquirer as well as for the Globe and National Examiner brands.
The sale is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million.
Last week, the New York Times reported that owners of the National Enquirer were in talks to sell the tabloid to California-based billionaire Ronald Burkle.
Paul Pope, one of the heirs of the National Enquirer founder, Generoso Pope Jr., had also been in the list of bidders, according to media reports.
On Tuesday, Pope dropped his bid to buy the supermarket tabloid from American Media, the New York Post reported.
Over its 92-year history, the National Enquirer has enticed readers in supermarket checkout lines with sensational headlines and photos about celebrities. The tabloid's website says it has an audience of 5 million.

Earlier in February, Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), accused the publication of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing intimate photos. AMI has defended its reporting on Bezos' affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",Uber's self-driving unit valued at $7.25 billion in new investment,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber's autonomous vehicle unit has raised $1 billion from a consortium of investors including SoftBank Group Corp, giving the company a much-needed funding boost for its pricey self-driving ambitions on the eve of its public stock offering.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc said on Thursday that the investment values its Advanced Technologies Group, which works to develop autonomous driving technology, at $7.25 billion. SoftBank will invest $333 million from its $100 billion Vision Fund, while Toyota Motor Corp and automotive parts supplier Denso Corp will invest a combined $667 million.
Toyota will also contribute up to an additional $300 million over the next three years to help cover the costs of building commercial self-driving vehicles, Uber said. 
Reuters had reported in March talks of the investment in ATG.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the funding ""will help maintain Uber's position at the forefront of"" a transforming transportation industry.
The funding allows Uber to transfer some of the substantial cost of developing self-driving cars onto outside investors. That is likely to appease some of Wall Street's concerns over Uber's spending on the autonomous unit, which has topped $1.07 billion since the program started in 2016. 
In its filing for an initial public offering this month, Uber cautioned that development of self-driving technology ""is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful"" and the company lagged certain competitors. 
The self-driving business unit brings in no meaningful revenue for Uber, which last year lost $3.03 billion.
As part of the investment, ATG becomes its own legal entity but remains under the control of Uber. A new ATG board will be formed, with six directors appointed from Uber, one from SoftBank and one from Toyota. Eric Meyhofer, currently the head of ATG, will take the title of CEO and report to the new board. 
Such sizeable deals are unusual for companies so close to an IPO, because bringing in large new investors changes the company's capital structure.
Uber is preparing to launch its ""roadshow,"" when it will pitch its company prospective investors, the week of April 29, setting up for an early May debut on the New York Stock Exchange. It is expected to raise $10 billion at a $90 billion to $100 billion valuation.
NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS
The transaction is expected to close the third quarter. The deal, however, will almost certainly require approval from the inter-agency regulatory group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). 
A law enacted last year expands that group's powers to review minority stakes by foreign investors in startups with certain sensitive technologies, and self-driving technology is widely considered to have defense applications.
SoftBank's investment in General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's self-driving car unit Cruise is still under CFIUS review and is likely weeks away from any decision, even though that investment was announced nearly a year ago.
Both SoftBank and Toyota are repeat Uber investors. SoftBank took a more than 16 percent stake in the company after investing around $8 billion last year, becoming its largest shareholder. Toyota invested in Uber in 2016 and again in August with a $500 million check to work jointly to develop self-driving cars. 
The investment comes despite growing disillusion with the self-driving business, which has failed to deliver on bold promises of commercial autonomous cars, and Uber's setbacks. A crash in March 2018 involving an Uber self-driving SUV killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, and forced the company to shutter its biggest testing operation and halt autonomous driving in other cities. 
Uber now has a small number of cars testing in Pittsburgh, during the day and in good weather, with two safety drivers. They do not offer rides to passengers. 
The Tempe crash hurt the entire industry, say self-driving company executives, dealing a blow to public confidence in the safety of robot cars. 

ATG chief scientist Raquel Urtasun said in an interview with Reuters this month it ""is not clear"" when self-driving cars will be deployed at a large scale, and for the next decade at least there will be a mix of robot and human-controlled cars.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 09:01PM ET</span>",Earnings deluge could make or break sentiment,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Next week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by U.S. companies. 
A wide swath of S&P 500 sectors are scheduled to report next week, with 155 companies representing over $9 trillion in market capitalization in the queue, more than 35 percent of the total for the index. 
Heavy hitters Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are due to report as well as a dozen Dow components such as United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM). 
""The focus is going to continue to be on earnings and what the message is and so far the message hasn’t been that great,"" said Ken Polcari, managing principal at Butcher Joseph Asset Management in New York. 
""If they continue to be what they are, these kind of lackluster reports, the market is going to get exhausted and it is going to back off. It is going to be an important week just for direction.""
Refinitiv data shows analysts expect the first year-over-year earnings decline since 2016. As of Thursday morning, they see profits declining 1.7%.
Rapidly sliding expectations for second-quarter profit growth have sparked concerns about an earnings recession. Right now estimates are for growth of 2.1% in the second quarter, down from the 6.5% increase at the start of the year and 9.2% on Oct 1. 
""That is the big question hanging over this thing, is this really an earnings recession?"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
Forrest said that while some companies have been able to hold the line on earnings due to their ability to control costs, investors would rather see earnings growing on consumer strength. 
Refinitiv data show 77 S&P 500 companies have reported, with 77.9% topping expectations, compared to the 65% beat rate since 1994 and the 76% over the past four quarters. 
But in a recent note to clients,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson said that while companies are likely to beat ""the significantly lowered bar"" for the first quarter, they believe it won't be the trough for the year. 
Wilson noted with the S&P 500 now near the top of their valuation range with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8, there is not much upside remaining without a resurgence in growth that the market currently anticipates. 
(Graphic: S&P forward PE ratio - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VPXmOV)
That return to growth has also been cast into doubt by the less than enthusiastic picture being painted by corporate outlooks. The current ratio of negative to positive preannouncements stands at 2.7, well above the 1.5 average over the past four quarters but in line with the long-term average dating to 1997. 
And while that number is elevated over the past year, some view last year's results as being positively affected by tax reform and at a level that is unsustainable this year.
""It is just a return to the normal, what we are used to seeing, in this quarter,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
Should results next week push earnings season further towards an earnings recession, that may still not derail the market, which was able to recover from the last one in 2016 that was fueled in part by worries about a China slowdown.
""Even if we were to get an earnings recession, to me that is not the end of the world, because comparisons are so strong from the year before and we’ve been through earnings recessions before and recovered,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. 

""We came out of that once we all got comfortable with the idea China’s economy was growing once again and we are sort of in a similar situation this time around

In February, Bafin initiated the ban due to volatility in Wirecard's stock following reports in the Financial Times that became the subject of an investigation by German authorities.
Wirecard has denied wrongdoing and the FT has stood by its reporting.
The short-selling ban ""has now expired"", Bafin said in a statement, without elaborating further. Short-selling is when an investor borrows shares to sell in the hope of being able to buy them back later at a lower price.
Earlier this week, Bafin filed a complaint with the Munich Prosecutor's Office alleging market manipulation in the shares of Wirecard.
A series of reports run by the FT, citing a whistleblower's claims of fraud and creative accounting at its Singapore office, have wiped billions off Wirecard's market value and triggered a police investigation in the Asian state.

The agreement comes a month after Barington urged the company to either explore a spin off of the underperforming Victoria's Secret brand or take the much financially stronger Bath & Body Works public.
Barington would now vote in favor of the entire L Brands board nominees at its 2019 annual shareholder meeting, the company said https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/701985/000095010319004932/dp105308_8k.htm.
As a special adviser, Barington would provide consulting and advisory services to the company for its business, operations, strategic and financial matters, the composition of the board and potential candidates for nomination.
L Brands also announced on Thursday a slate of director nominees for election to the board, which includes three independent directors. The company's nominees include its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leslie Wexner.
In March, Barington had also suggested that the role of chairman and chief executive officer be held by separate individuals, an increasingly popular demand by activist investors who feel it would help companies run better.

(Reuters) - Investors' appetite for risk was on display yet again this week with huge cash inflows into U.S.-based stock exchange-traded funds, corporate bond funds and high-yield ""junk"" bond portfolios, according to Refinitiv's Lipper research service data on Thursday.
U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds attracted more than $2.3 billion in the week ended Wednesday, extending their weekly inflow streak since late January, Lipper said. U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds attracted more than $1.1 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their sixth consecutive week of inflows, Lipper said.
Stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted about $7.35 billion of inflows, Lipper said. Investors in exchange-traded funds are thought to represent institutional investors, including hedge funds. Mutual funds are thought to represent retail investors. U.S. stock mutual funds posted cash withdrawals of more than $1.84 billion, Lipper added. 
Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper, said a ""tale of two cities"" still exists within equities. 
""Mom and Pop are still net sellers of equity funds, withdrawing $1.8 billion for the week, while (institutional investors) continue to pad the coffers of equity ETFs,"" Roseen said. ""But for the 14th consecutive week, the average fund investor remained enamored by fixed-income funds, pouring in roughly $1.7 billion this week.""
All told, Roseen said investors put money to work, partly evident in the cash withdrawals from money-market funds. Investors yanked cash from money funds to pay for taxes but they also felt compelled to put money to work in rising markets, he said. U.S.-based money market funds posted $54.5 billion in outflows in the week ended Wednesday, their largest cash withdrawal since August 2011. 
""I am attributing that to tax season and investors’ moves back into bonds and equity funds,"" Roseen said. 
Outside the United States, U.S.-based emerging market funds attracted more than $417 million in the week ended Wednesday, extending their weekly inflow streak since early January, according to Lipper. U.S.-based international funds attracted $1.22 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their first inflows since mid-March, Lipper said.

On Wednesday, Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau called for pilots to receive simulator training for Boeing’s new 737 MAX software, going beyond a draft report by a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration-appointed board, which recommended additional training without requiring a simulator.
Boeing is working to deliver to global regulators a software update and new training proposals for the MAX following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October and an Ethiopian crash in March, which killed 346 people combined.
Boeing said on Wednesday it was making ""steady progress"" on the path to certifying the software update and had made the final test flight before a certification flight.

(Reuters) - Shares of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc surged almost 30 percent in their stock market debut on Thursday, valuing the online scrapbook company at around $16 billion and signaling investor appetite for new tech listings.
That bodes well for the U.S. IPO market as ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc prepares for its highly anticipated debut, particularly with shares in smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) floundering below their March offering price. 
""All of the gyrations that you read about in the press and the drama that you read about in other cases, we can certainly fall victim to a lot of those things if we are distracted by the news cycle or things that are short-term by nature,"" Pinterest Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said. 
""But we're focused on building the best version of Pinterest we can over the next several years.""
Pinterest shares opened at $23.75, well above the $19 they were priced at, and closed at $24.40
Zoom Video Communications Inc shares also surged in the U.S. video conferencing company's first day of trading on Thursday, closing 72 percent above their IPO price of $36. 
""It is a very favorable market at the moment,"" Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said in an interview. ""Investors really see the opportunity for 'software as a service' companies.""
Investors are hopeful that money-losing Pinterest, the most high-profile social media company to list in the United States since  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2017, will have a strong run in the market, given the company's ability to grow revenue and increase its user base.
""When you see an initial pop in price like this it's a pretty clear indicator interest is strong out of the gate,"" said Chris Larkin, senior vice president of trading at E*TRADE Financial Corp.
'RIGHT TRACK'
Pinterest allows users to search for topics like home improvement projects and travel tips, with results often showing handy infographics. It also lets users create themed social ""boards."" 
The company brings in revenue through advertisements, which are placed among the ""pins"" or posts that users upload on the site.
Pinterest had a net loss of $63 million on revenue of $756 million in 2018. It expects to report 291 million global monthly active users as of March 31, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
Pinterest was showing a clear path to profitability but was overvalued, said Haran Segram, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.
The IPOs of Pinterest and other loss-making unicorns - startup companies with valuations of at least $1 billion - have presented a predicament for investors. 
While they do not want to miss out on popular companies with fast growth, they also have to weigh the risks of businesses with unproven economics.

Pinterest's IPO was underwritten by 12 banks led by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).

499,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Risk of U.S. 'profit recession' eases as results beat forecasts,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The initial earnings results of this reporting period are beating expectations by a wide margin, suggesting to some investors that the S&P 500 may be able to avoid a so-called ""profit recession"" this year because predicted economic bad news has failed to materialize.
That is a reversal of the view from a few months ago, when the 2019 profit outlook appeared to be getting worse. Earnings already faced tough comparisons with last year, when the U.S. tax code overhaul provided a big boost.
The quarter could be the trough for ""this mini down cycle,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. ""The market is now expecting to see earnings stabilize. Eventually, if the global story gets better as we expect, earnings will help propel the market higher later this year.""
Though it is still early in the season, the aggregate profit forecast has improved from an estimated year-over-year decline of 2.5% a week ago to an expected decline of just 1.7% as of Thursday, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The average earnings surprise so far is higher than what is typical. Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout, said based on his data, the earnings surprise factor for the 77 S&P 500 companies that have reported is 6.1%, the highest in at least three years.
The average earnings surprise for an entire earnings period since 1994 is 3.2%, based on Refinitiv's data.
Moreover, 78% of the companies reporting have beaten estimates on earnings per share, above the amount at the same time last quarter.
The data underscores the view that S&P 500 companies will end up posting an increase in year-over-year earnings for the first quarter, and that a profit recession - defined as two straight quarters of year-over-year earnings declines - is much less likely in 2019. That, in turn, could support the argument that a long bull market in stocks could get longer still since earnings drive stock prices.
The last S&P 500 earnings recession ran from July 2015 to June of 2016.
""Numbers were slashed significantly going into this reporting period,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""I think we are going to end up seeing flat to positive growth for the quarter when it is all said and done.""
To be sure, the earnings season is just getting going, and corporate earnings face a number a headwinds: costs are rising because of tensions with U.S. trading partners, a stronger dollar diminishes the value of overseas sales, and technology companies in aggregate are looking at a likely profit decline in the first quarter.
Analysts began to cut earnings forecasts for 2019 in the fourth quarter and the market sold off as worries increased over the interest rate and economic outlook, and as the United States' trade conflict with China seemed far from over.
But those fears have eased since then, and the S&P 500 index has risen sharply since late December.
Profit forecasts for the second quarter and beyond have steadied as well.

""We have actually seen some signs of life as companies are starting to report first-quarter earnings slightly better than expected,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Inc's chief equity strategist, Kate Moore, said during the asset manager's quarterly U.S. wealth advisory event on Wednesday.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Banks ordered to disclose bondholder information to Puerto Rico board,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A judge on Thursday ordered banks to comply with a request from Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board to disclose customer information related to certain debt issued by the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth.
The ruling boosts a potential effort by the board to recover billions of dollars in payments made to bondholders should a federal court hearing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy cases choose to invalidate disputed debt issued by the government and its agencies.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith Gail Dein's order said ""good cause exists"" to grant the board's motion, which seeks to compel banks to submit bondholder names and addresses along with Puerto Rico debt payments the bondholders received between 2013 and 2017.
The Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) Bank, and U.S. Bank objected to the board's request last week, citing concerns over disclosing confidential customer information, as well as the cost and ability to produce a large amount of information by the April 19 deadline set by the board.
The judge ordered the banks and the board to submit a proposed confidentiality agreement by April 23 and set rolling deadlines of April 25, April 30 and May 8 for the banks to submit bondholder information. She rejected requests by the banks to be reimbursed for their costs and for indemnity for claims that could result from compliance with the order.
It was unclear whether the banks will appeal. Attorneys for the banks either declined to comment or could not immediately be reached. 
The quest for bondholder information is related to an attempt by the board and some creditor groups in the bankruptcy to have the federal court void more than $6 billion of defaulted general obligation (GO) bonds sold in 2012 and 2014, as well as debt issued by Puerto Rico's Public Buildings Authority and bonds sold for the island's Employees Retirement System.
The board filed bankruptcy for the island in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. But it did not seek to void the GO bonds on the basis they were issued in violation of debt limits in the Puerto Rico Constitution until January 2019, just months before the statute of limitations on bringing such actions runs out in early May.

U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain is scheduled to take up the board's motion to extend that deadline at an April 24 hearing.

The S&P 500 rose 0.16%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.42%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.02%. Market volumes were thin heading into the holiday weekend.
Industrials racked up gains as  United Rentals  (NYSE:URI) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) rallied after delivering better-than-expected earnings.
United Rentals surged 8.20% and Honeywell rose 3.8% as both companies beat on the top and bottom lines.
But investors had to contend with weaker-than-expected earnings from Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) and Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX). Both ended the day sharply lower.
Falling energy stocks also kept gains in the broader market in check, despite oil prices settling higher following data showing Saudi Arabia cut crude exports in February.
In consumer discretionaries, tobacco stocks came under pressure on reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will propose legislation to raise the legal tobacco age in the U.S. to 21 from 18.
Altria (NYSE:MO), Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) ended the day lower.
Health care stocks pared losses to end just above the flatline, finally showing resilience after steep losses on concerns that government reforms could destabilize the sector.
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) CEO David Wichmann told analysts in a conference call earlier this week that proposals by Democrats like Medicare for All would ""destabilize the nation’s health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best."" UnitedHealth gained 2.3% on the day after two days of losses. It finished the week down 0.7%.
In tech, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) fell 0.7% after Wedbush Securities downgraded its rating on the stock to neutral from outperform.
“With shares currently trading around 8x the consensus 2020 revenue estimate, current valuation appears to leave little room for multiple expansion, as greater investor confidence in current management and the potential for earlier-than-expected profitability appear to be largely priced in,” Wedbush said.
In other company news, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and  Zoom Technologies  (OTC:ZOOM) rallied after making their stock market debuts, adding billions to their market caps.
On the economic front, better-than-expected retail sales, pointing to underlining strength in the consumer also boosted sentiment on stocks.
""A bounce in consumption is consistent with the pendulum of economic sentiment swinging back from the extreme negatives seen last month,"" BMO said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrials led the S&P 500 and the Dow moderately higher on Thursday after robust U.S. economic data and some healthy corporate earnings reports.
All three major U.S. stock indexes closed in positive territory heading into the three-day weekend. 
For the holiday-shortened week, the S&P snapped its three-week winning streak, while the Dow and the Nasdaq posted weekly gains. 
The bellwether S&P 500 has hovered within a percent of its all-time high for the last five sessions.
""It's been kind of an anemic market over the last few weeks,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""There's concern that the majority of the returns in 2019 were front-end loaded."" 
U.S. retail sales in March blew past analyst expectations, rising at their fastest monthly pace in 1-1/2 years, according to the Commerce Department. 
In a separate report, data from the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped last week to a 50-year low. 
Industrial stocks boosted the markets following upbeat quarterly results and remarks from China's commerce ministry spokesman that progress has been made in U.S.-China trade talks. 
With reporting season in full swing, January-March S&P 500 profits are expected to have dropped 1.7% year-on-year, which would mark the first decline in quarterly earnings since 2016.
Of the 77 S&P 500 companies that have released results thus far, 77.9% have beaten consensus, compared with the 65% average beat rate going back to 1994.
""Expectations were so low going into the quarter, there's been some nice surprises,"" Keator added.
Growing demand for aircraft parts drove Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) Inc's earnings beat. The company raised its full-year forecast, and its stock rose 3.8%. 
Fewer catastrophe losses helped Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Companies Inc report higher-than-expected profit. The property & casualty insurer's stock gained 2.3%.
 Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) shares advanced 4.4% after beating earnings estimates as price hikes helped the railroad offset the impact of severe weather and midwest floods.
Among earnings misses, Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) reported a 20% drop in first-quarter profit. Its shares slipped 3.9%. 
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Co's quarterly revenue fell short of analyst estimates, but the stock ended the session up 1.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 110 points, or 0.42%, to 26,559.54, the S&P 500 gained 4.58 points, or 0.16%, to 2,905.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.98 points, or 0.02%, to 7,998.06.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven closed in the black.
Industrials were the biggest percentage gainers, up 1.1%.
Online scrapbook company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc jumped 28.4% in its debut.
Meanwhile,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) dropped 1.9%. The ride-hailing service's stock is now trading 19% below its $72 offer price.
U.S. stock markets will be closed on Good Friday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 77 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.79 billion shares, in line with the average over the last 20 trading days.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 03:58PM ET</span>",GM CEO Barra's pay dipped slightly to just under $22 million in 2018,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's top executive, Mary Barra, received a compensation package worth just under $22 million in 2018, slightly less than the previous year, according to the No. 1 U.S. automaker's proxy statement released on Thursday.
GM also said two members of the board of directors - former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, retired Admiral Michael Mullen and the former CEO of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) , James Mulva - will not stand for re-election. The Detroit company did not name replacements, meaning the number of board members will drop to 11.
GM and the rest of the auto industry are facing an expected decline in U.S. demand this year, slowing sales in the world's largest auto market in China and potential costly tariffs that could be imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump as it negotiates new trade deals with China, Europe and Japan.
GM is also investing heavily in developing electric and self-driving technologies.
Barra's total compensation package was valued at $21.87 million, slightly below the $21.96 million she received in 2017. Barra, GM's chairman and chief executive, was paid $22.58 million in 2016. GM said Barra's pay was 281 times that of the median company employee.
Barra's pay package included a salary of $2.1 million, unchanged from 2017; stock awards worth almost $11.1 million; options worth more than $3.4 million and a performance award worth almost $4.5 million, according to the proxy.
Barra is GM's highest paid executive. Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara received slightly more than $5.5 million in total compensation, and Chuck Stevens, who she replaced last September, received just under $7 million, according to the proxy. 
Former President Dan Ammann, who now heads GM's Cruise automation unit, received just under $9 million, while Mark Reuss, who replaced Ammann as president, received almost $7.4 million, according to the proxy.
GM's annual investor meeting is scheduled to be held online on June 4.

One shareholder proposal requests the board adopt as policy the naming of an independent board chairman, a proposal that at the 2017 annual meeting received 41 percent voting support. GM opposes the proposal.

506,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds Aggressively Shorting VIX Shouldn't Ring Alarm Bells,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds shorting stock volatility en masse is the latest canary in the coal mine for those fretting dovish central banks are setting the stage for the next market blow-up.
Not so fast, says a growing chorus of Wall Street voices.
As policy makers squeeze monetary uncertainty from asset prices, the fast money is betting against further swings in U.S. equities, according to futures data on the Cboe Volatility Index, or the VIX. Net shorts are close to record highs.
But strategists are pushing back on fears that complacent traders are gripped in a speculative mania. They’re citing everything from the billions riding passive products tracking the long side of the wager to the smaller value of VIX shorts versus previous highs.
The positioning data overall paints a far “more nuanced” picture on the state of the volatility landscape, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
“Discussions tend to miss the other side of the trade -- namely, the net long volatility exposure in VIX exchange-traded products, which now stands near an all-time high,” strategists including Anshul Gupta wrote in a note.
Just look at vega, or the sensitivity of options to changes in implied volatility. At $215 million, the long vega in ETPs is greater than the short vega of the VIX futures shorts at $164 million, according to Bank of America data.
In other words, sliced and diced this way, the longs are sizeable.
Meltdown Memories
And for those obsessed with hedge-fund shorts, it’s foolhardy to take net-positioning data at face value.
Volatility speculators typically hold a mix of long and shorts either as a hedge or a relative-value strategy, with U.S. positions often the funding leg of global trades.
“We don’t care so much about ‘net’ positioning so much as we care about how much short vol is out there that could be covered,” wrote Pravit Chintawongvanich, Wells Fargo’s equity derivatives strategist, in a note. “Short VIX futures positioning is actually smaller than the previous highs and the net position looks the way it does because long VIX futures positioning is down a lot.”
And it’s not even clear that investors in risk assets should fret too much about these signals from the volatility-derivatives market. While exchange-traded products that were short VIX futures arguably helped fuel February’s Volmageddon, their firepower has been considerably depleted.
“We look to debunk any myth that extreme short positioning in VIX leads to a spike in the VIX in the near-term, particularly given the dampened effect of volatility ETPs following the events of February 2018,” Maxwell Grinacoff, quantitative strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, said in a note.
He found no real statistical link between net positioning in VIX futures and the forward one-month performance of the S&P 500, or the VIX itself.
That’s not to say futures speculation doesn’t matter.
In an equity sell-off, a feverish tug of war will break out between buyers of futures on the one hand and sellers on the other, pulling the contracts in opposite directions until an equilibrium emerges, according to the BofA strategists. All that will impact the VIX -- but outsized selling pressure is unlikely to spark a disruptive move.
As short ETPs are shadow of their former selves, large institutional sellers of volatility are more important players nowadays. These accounts have a higher pain threshold than the type of smaller retail players or leveraged funds that blew up in the first quarter of 2018.
Their presence was likely felt during the depths of the December equity sell-off when implied volatility was relatively cheap and skew, a cost measure for tail-risk protection, was suppressed. That all suggests the DNA of participants is just as important as the size of the short wagers.
“It is really a question of which side of the trade has the ‘weaker hand,’ i.e., is more reactive to risk as a vol spike unfolds,” the BofA strategists wrote."
507,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",Grounded Jet Air Takes a Toll as Airfares Spike and Staff Protest,"(Bloomberg) -- Passengers stranded, employees protesting on the streets of India’s capital and authorities scrambling to put more flights in the air -- that’s the view on the ground after Jet Airways India Ltd. pulled its final few aircraft from the sky.
Once India’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways’ dominance and profitability were slowly whittled away by competitors, whose no-frills options forced base fares down to as low as 2 cents. Since the start of this year, Jet has scrambled for a capital infusion to meet payments to lenders, employees and aircraft lessors. With no respite in sight, the carrier finally accepted defeat, saying on Wednesday that all flights would be temporarily halted.
About a hundred people, including uniformed Jet Airways pilots, took to the streets on Thursday in New Delhi to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene. As they pressed for a rescue, airfares for domestic travelers are expected to climb 30 percent on average as capacity is squeezed heading into a peak travel period, according to flight-booking website Yatra Online Pvt Ltd. Fares of some international routes have also spiked.
“Jet Airways is very important to the economy,” said Rajesh Handa, a pilot with Jet Airways for 18 years. “We request the prime minister to come out and help us -- not just us but the economy of the country.”
Jet Airways has 23,000 employees and scenes of staff and their families protesting are particularly concerning from Modi, who is in the middle of a sprawling six-week general election where opposition parties have hammered his government on its jobs record.
“There’s people whose families are completely dependent on this airline,"" said Renu Rajora, a Jet Airways cabin crew member for the past five years. “We don’t have salaries, we don’t have any money. It’s April, and admissions are going on for schools.”
Separately, the civil aviation ministry said on Wednesday that it’s assisting airlines and airports to rapidly bring in capacity to ensure fares remain stable and competitive. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation and others are monitoring the situation to ensure existing rules regarding refunds, cancellations and alternate booking are followed, it said.
“It is indeed very sad to see Jet Airways grounded,” said Sharat Dhall, chief operating officer of the business-to-consumer segment at Yatra. “Fares are likely to further go up if Jet Airways delays getting planes back in the air or the capacity gap is not filled by other carriers.
Fifteen-day advance fares have risen as much as 10 percent compared to last year, while three-day advance fare levels have shot up by 25 percent to 30 percent with the grounding coming at a time of peak summer vacation demand, he said.

He joined Nissan in 2004 in Europe and led its expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has raised its market share in the United States and posted record sales.
Munoz resigned from Nissan in January, further rattling the Japanese automaker's management team amid the investigation into ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn's alleged financial misconduct.
Widely considered as a close ally of Ghosn and a potential successor to lead the automaking partnership between Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Munoz had been a ""person of interest"" in Nissan's widening internal investigation.

PARIS (Reuters) - An attempt by French sugar group Tereos to spread risk on a 250 million euro ($281 million) loan secured earlier this year has failed to attract bidders, leaving three main creditor banks with exposure, sources familiar with the matter said.
Tereos, the world's second-biggest sugar producer, has struggled to cope with poor market conditions since the European Union's output quota regime ended in 2017, warning that it would post a loss for a second year in a row this season.
The debt-laden cooperative group said in February it had subscribed a 250 million euros ($281 million) loan with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Natixis and Rabobank, to reimburse half of its 2020 bond one year in advance.
Tereos then launched a syndication round with about 10 banks, including other members of its banking pool and new ones, in a bid to spread the risk, the sources said.
The call, for 50 million euros, failed to attract any bidders by April 15, they said.
""The group is in constant dialogue with its financial partners on various financing operations around the world. The group does not comment on these non-public discussions which, taken in isolation, may give a misleading picture of the group's funding,"" Tereos said in an email statement.
Potential bidders were put off by tough conditions for European sugar producers faced with a collapse in prices but also by the company's high debt level and poor results expected this year, one source said.
""The problem here was significant risk. The pricing offered failed to attract banks,"" one source said. ""This means they will have to pay more and go elsewhere.""
The departure of the group's Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Casanova, responsible for presenting the syndication offer, discouraged potential participants, the source said.
Natixis and BNP declined to comment. Rabobank was not immediately available to comment.
DEBT MOUNTS
Tereos held net debt of 2.7 billion euros by Dec. 31, up 4.5 percent on the year, putting the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 8.0 versus 4.1 a year earlier.
Concerns about Tereos' financial health in a difficult sugar market sent yields on the group's bonds to all time highs late last year and they have remained high since with Tereos' June 2023 bond yielding 8.5 percent on Thursday.
The sugar maker said in February it maintained at group level a financial security of 1 billion euros as of Dec. 31, 2018, including a still undrawn 225 million euros back-up facility, despite plunging profits.
A surge in output after the European Union abolished production quotas and a 40 percent slump in prices since early 2017 in an oversupplied world market has hit profits for several European firms.
Suedzucker, Europe's largest sugar refiner, said in February it would halt sugar output at two factories of its French branch Saint Louis Sucre while French competitor Cristal Union is planning to shut another two.
Tereos has said that the group does not expect to close any plants in France.
The group is looking at opening its business to partners to boost diversification and internationalization. The process could take two or three years, it said.

The forecasts from the U.S. Trade Representative's office were released ahead of an independent trade panel's hotly anticipated analysis that economists expect to show little or no U.S. gains from the new U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement.
A USTR official told reporters that the jobs and investment estimates are based on plans disclosed by automakers to the trade agency for compliance with the new agreement's tighter rules of origin. These require 75 percent of a vehicle's content to be produced in North American, with 40-45 percent produced in high wage areas, namely the United States or Canada.
A senior USTR official told reporters that none of the 15 automakers producing vehicles in North America intend to opt out of the agreement to pay U.S. tariffs instead and move production overseas, as some critics of the deal have suggested.
""They have verbally committed to us that they intend to comply with the rules,"" the official said. ""And they have told us that this is not going to have significant upward pressure on vehicle prices.""

515,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>","Sears sues Lampert, claiming he looted assets and drove it into bankruptcy","By Jonathan Stempel and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp sued longtime former chairman Eddie Lampert, his hedge fund ESL Investments and others like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, claiming they illegally siphoned billions of dollars of assets from the retailer before it went bankrupt.
The lawsuit, made public on Thursday, was filed by the restructuring team winding down Sears' bankruptcy estate and suing on behalf of creditors, many of whom blame Lampert for the retailer's downfall.
It followed the billionaire's $5.2 billion purchase in February of most Sears assets, including the DieHard and Kenmore brands, after a bankruptcy auction.
The complaint seeks the repayment of ""billions of dollars of value looted from Sears,"" including while it was in what Lampert would later call a ""death spiral"" where it sold core assets to meet daily expenses with no real plan for becoming profitable.
""Had defendants not taken these improper and illegal actions, Sears would have had billions of dollars more to pay its third-party creditors today and would not have endured the amount of disruption, expense, and job losses resulting from its recent bankruptcy filing,"" the complaint said.
Sears filed for Chapter 11 protection in October after a prolonged decline under Lampert marked by large losses, scant investment and lost market share to retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Others sued include ESL President Kunal Kamlani; Bruce Berkowitz and his Fairholme Capital Management, which was a large Sears shareholder; and Seritage Growth Properties, which took over 266 of Sears' best stores in a 2015 spinoff.
Mnuchin, a college roommate of Lampert's at Yale University, had been a director at Sears and ESL, and previously worked with Lampert at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
In a statement on behalf of ESL, Lampert and Kalmani, ESL said it vigorously disputed the lawsuit, calling the allegations ""misleading or just flat wrong,"" and saying all transactions were done in good faith and for shareholders' benefit.
Fairholme said it was reviewing the complaint. Seritage and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
'DEATH SPIRAL'
Lampert created Sears Holdings through the 2005 merger of Sears, Roebuck & Co and Kmart Holdings Corp.
According to the complaint, Lampert and other insiders had by 2011 begun hatching a plan to ""strip"" Sears of assets, as the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer's performance fell short and more ESL investors were demanding their money back.
The complaint said Lampert ordered the creation of bogus financial plans projecting a Sears turnaround, and used them to help transfer five major assets worth more than $2 billion, including Land's End and Sears Hometown Outlet.
Sears' bankruptcy estate in particular faulted the conduct of Lampert and others in the $2.58 billion Seritage spinoff.
It said that transaction undervalued the real estate by at least $649 million, stuck Sears with hundreds of millions of dollars of rent and fees from leasing most of the 266 stores back, and was structured to benefit favored shareholders like Lampert, in part through Seritage's payment of dividends.
Seritage reported $24.1 million of funds from operations in 2018, a measure of cash flow, and last July obtained a $2 billion loan package from Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) Berkshire is not a defendant.
Thursday's lawsuit was filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York.
It seeks a declaration that the alleged looting constituted ""fraudulent transfers"" that should be undone or, more likely, justified damages.
The reorganized Sears was expected to have about 425 Sears and Kmart stores, down from roughly 3,500 at the time of the 2005 merger.

The case is Sears Holdings Corp et al v Lampert et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-ap-08250. The main bankruptcy case is In re Sears Holdings Corp in the same court, No. 18-bk-23538.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. pilot program allows online grocery shopping with food stamps,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it has launched a pilot program in New York that allows consumers dependant on food stamps to use them to buy groceries online, a move that is likely to boost sales at retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Both companies are participating in the initial pilot launch with Wakefern Food Corp's ShopRite supermarket chain expected to join the program early next week, the USDA said. Walmart will offer the service in upstate New York, while ShopRite and Amazon will service the New York City area.
Food stamps are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides free food to some 40 million Americans, or about 12 percent of the total U.S. population.
""People who receive SNAP benefits should have the opportunity to shop for food the same way more and more Americans shop for food – by ordering and paying for groceries online,"" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement.
Walmart, the world's largest retailer, already has 40 stores in other parts of the country that allow shoppers to pay for groceries ordered online using food stamps.
The new program will expand to Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington, and additional retailers are expected to take part, the USDA said.
Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company has nearly 275 stores that offer grocery pickup in the nine states eligible for the pilot. 
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, in a blog post on Thursday said New York customers can shop on AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry without requiring a membership fee. 
""Amazon believes the program will dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers and help to mitigate the public health crisis of food deserts,"" the retailer said.

The pilot program will involve the use of electronic benefit (EBT) cards issued by New York to allow for the online purchases.

Schelling, a member of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, served as finance minister in the previous government until December 2017. Last year, he agreed to work as an adviser for the Russian-lead Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, of which OMV is a financing partner.
Austria holds 31.5 percent in the country's largest listed company via state holding OeBAG and Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala is a second core shareholder with 24.9 percent. 
Nine of OMV's 15 supervisory board mandates must be reassigned at the annual shareholder meeting on May 14. Eight contracts expire and the current board chair, former Siemens chief executive Peter Loescher has also decided to step down. 
OeBAG boss Thomas Schmid and the chief executives of Vienna Insurance, Elisabeth Stadler, and Lenzing, Stefan Doboczky, are also nominated as new candidates for the supervisory board, OMV said on its website.
As a finance minister, Schelling supported OMV in its negotiations on an asset swap with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and in 2016 took part in the ceremony, in which OMV agreed to exchange a stake in its Norwegian business for a stake in the Russian group's Achimov oil and gas exploration blocks. 
The deal was abandoned last year due to opposition from Norway. OMV said at the time that it would buy the Siberian assets instead of swapping them.
There is still no deal and OMV CEO Rainer Seele has said he expects the price negotiations to drag on until summer after he had initially guided for an agreement in early 2019.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>",South Africa's Shoprite cuts chairman Wiese's voting influence,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African grocer Shoprite is to buy back deferred shares held by its chairman Christo Wiese to simplify its voting structure but substantially curbing Wiese's influence in the company he helped turn into an African powerhouse.
Besides ordinary shares, Shoprite's capital structure includes deferred shares which carry about 32.3 percent of the voting rights at Shoprite. The deferred shares are held by Weise's investment vehicle, Thibault Square (NYSE:SQ) Financial Services Proprietary Ltd. 
Under the deal, Titan - another one of Wiese's entities - will receive 20 million new ordinary shares from Shoprite, in exchange for deferred shares which Shoprite will buy for 265,000 rand ($18,836.41) and cancel, the retailer said in a statement.
The proposed deal will see Wiese's voting interest reduced to 17.8 percent from 42.3 percent, while his direct shareholding will increase to 17.8 percent from 14.8 percent, Shoprite said.
Following the issuance of the new shares, the total voting interest of minority shareholders will increase from nearly 60 percent to more than 80 percent, while their shareholding will be diluted by 3.5 percent, it added.
Wiese has been instrumental in Shoprite's transformation from just six outlets in South Africa in the 1970s to 2,800 shops across Africa, dwarfing rivals including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's South African unit Massmart.
Shoprite, which also sells furniture and medicine, said the deal is expected to result in a potential once-off reduction in earnings and headline earnings of 3.3 billion rand, based on a 30-day-volume-weighted-average price of 165.35 rand per share as at April 17.

Shares of the New York-based company were up 2 percent.
AmEx has been bolstering its rewards programs and relying on partnerships to get customers to spend more. Last year, it renewed partnership with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) that brought in over a million customers over the past two years, the company said.
The rewards program helped push quarterly card customer spending up 4 percent from a year ago.
Total expenses in the quarter went up 11 percent at $7.6 billion, while the company spent $2.46 billion on card rewards, up 4 percent from last year.
AmEx also expects its marketing expenses to rise by $200 million in the year on Delta partnership, as it tries to combat stiff competition for customers from big rival banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
The company missed quarterly revenue estimates for a second straight quarter even though total revenue, excluding interest expense, rose 7 percent to $10.36 billion. 
Revenue was hurt by flat growth in its global merchant and network services unit, compared to a year ago, the company said.
Meanwhile, net income fell to $1.55 billion, or $1.80 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.63 billion, or $1.86 per share, a year earlier https://reut.rs/2VQDifq.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.01 per share, ahead of analysts' expectations of a profit of $1.99 per share.

The burger chain added the Signature Crafted burgers to its menu two years ago to keep up with competition from Wendy's and Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK), which serve more premium burgers using fresh ingredients.
But putting together the burgers took time, slowing down service lines at drive-thrus and at stores.
These premium beef, grilled or crispy chicken burgers came with condiments like pico guacamole, sweet BBQ bacon or maple bacon dijon, compared with the Quarter Pounders, which are beef patties served with ketchup, pickles and onions.
The company said its new deluxe and bacon Quarter Pounders received good feedback and it would continue to focus on such items.
""It (the removal) probably has more to do about the process of cooking the burger in McDonald's than it does what the consumer is saying about the food,"" said Howard Penney, a managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management.
Big franchisees also did not buy into the idea of McDonald's pricier burgers initially, mindful of the cooking time required for these made-to-order burgers.
""It makes it easier for the people running the stores and operating the stores ... simple is good,"" Penney said.
The move is seen as a positive, coming at a time when quick service restaurants are moving away from customization and focusing more on transparency in the ingredients used.
This is the second time McDonald's has tweaked its menu this month, after trimming down its late-night menu to keep only eights items.

Shares of the Dow component have risen nearly 18 percent in the past year, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Index's 6.7 percent rise.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 10:38AM ET</span>","Airbus sells longer-range A321, expects quick end to Boeing crisis","By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said it is selling longer-range versions of its A321, while signaling a shift away from chasing market share at any cost and predicting Boeing (NYSE:BA) will emerge quickly from the grounding of its rival 737 MAX.
Scherer, who took on the top sales role in September, told Reuters that Airbus is seeing more demand for longer-range versions of roughly 200-seat planes previously used for medium-haul routes, blurring boundaries with bigger jets.
""We are selling increased range on the A321. People are telling us this is a great module, give me more range. (We say) we will give you the maximum range we can on the A321: how many would you like? That is what we are doing,"" he said in his first substantial interview in his new role.
Scherer's remarks are the strongest indication yet that Airbus has quietly launched the A321XLR, a keenly awaited new version of its single-aisle plane that competes with the 737 MAX and could brush up against a proposed new Boeing mid-market jet.
Airbus and Boeing compete ferociously for sales of single aisle jets like the MAX and A320 or A321 and the effort to expand Airbus' lead in the market for its cash cow predates last month's grounding of the 737 MAX following two crashes.
""I am certainly not encouraging any sort of behavior to try and exploit this situation, because this is out of bounds,"" he said of Airbus, which has limited potential to increase output.
Sources also say Airbus is worried about a regulatory backlash over the 737 MAX crisis.
Separately, sources say Airbus has already signed up customers for the A321XLR, which is being developed at a cost of several hundred million dollars although its launch has not yet been formally announced. 
The two planemakers have been raising production to serve record air travel, though Boeing has dropped back from 52 to 42 such planes a month due to the MAX crisis.
Airbus plans to increase single-aisle output from 57 to 63 a month from next year but recently halted plans to go as high as 70 due to objections from overstretched engine makers. 
Industrial issues aside, Scherer cited demand beyond 63 jets a month. Asked if the market could absorb 70, he said: ""That number has been used before and I see the logic of it.""
The suggestion is likely to worry leasing companies and engine makers who have urged restraint on jetmakers trying to make good on a seven-year waiting list of unfilled orders.
The situation is different in wide-body jets where Airbus has been outsold three to one by Boeing for two years. Scherer pointed toward future sales of the A330neo, a 250-300-seater that has been struggling to make a mark against Boeing's 787.
""I'll take a bet that in a year from now there will be no doubts about the A330,"" he said.
NEW CHESSBOARD
Scherer, whose father flew in the first ever Airbus test flight as an engineer, became head of sales in September after a career in sales contracts, strategy, defense and turboprops.
As head of strategy he was closely associated with the 2010 launch of the re-engined Airbus A320neo, which precipitated Boeing's decision to drop plans for an all-new jet and launch the 737 MAX, as well as with moves to open a U.S. A320 plant.
Urbane and multilingual, Scherer's style contrasts with that of long-serving sales chief John Leahy who dominated aviation for 25 years with a dizzying pursuit of higher market share as he dragged Airbus from upstart to Boeing's commercial equal.
""We will defend where we are. But as I look into the future it's a different kind of chessboard than when Airbus had to lift itself from a 20 percent market share to 50,"" Scherer said.
Market share is one yardstick but ""it is not our business objective,"" he added. ""It is not how I measure if I had a good day, it is do I have the confidence of customers, am I making money, am I controlling costs?""
Investors monitor such language because market-share battles have tended in the past to conflict with higher profit margins. 
Scherer is up against a relentless dealmaker in Boeing sales chief Ihssane Mounir, who snatched the orders crown last year, while Airbus had a negative first quarter on orders due to cancellations.
Analysts say Scherer is picking market battles but will come under some pressure to sustain orders. He must also respond to Boeing proposals for a New Mid-sized Airplane (NMA) between the A321neo and A330neo, though he insists Boeing's plan won't work.
How that battles plays out could affect choices and timing of the next generation of single-aisle jets like the MAX and A321neo from 2030, which is beginning to influence strategies.
Scherer, who keeps a model in his office of a jet code-named A30X, which would have seen the light of day if Boeing had opted for a new jet instead of the MAX, is focused on current business but acknowledges Airbus is shaping its ideas beyond the A320neo.

""I would like you to believe that we have more than started to think about it,"" he said.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",France points way for UK shake up of audit market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Taking on the Big Four accounting firms will remain a lengthy and costly challenge for smaller rivals in Britain despite the regulatory leg-up unveiled on Thursday, but France has shown it can be done over a decade.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has ordered that Britain's top 350 listed companies must hire two auditors to loosen the grip of EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC that individually check the books of all but nine of those companies.
It forms a package of measures from the CMA aimed at improving audit quality and restoring trust after accounting failures at construction company Carillion and retailer BHS.
Though the changes are likely to take some time to make it into law, joint audits in France have enabled smaller rivals like Mazars to work alongside the Big Four and win the confidence of bigger clients.
They also feature in Sweden and Spain, but were ditched in Denmark due to the higher cost, with estimates ranging from about 20 percent to far higher.
""We know it works and we know it will work in Britain and will create a markedly different market that is much needed,"" said David Herbinet, the London-based global head of audit at Mazars.
According to the International Accounting Bulletin (IAB), Deloitte earned $43.2 billion globally in audit and consultancy fees in 2018 - a fifth of the market - while PwC earned $41.9 billion, EY $35 billion, and KPMG $29 billion.
Smaller competitors BDO and Grant Thornton earned $9 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.
Checking the books of big, international companies with subsidiaries across the world has long been the preserve of the Big Four given the need for a cross-border network of partners and big spending on IT.
Deloitte, for example, employed 286,000 staff in 2018 compared with 80,000 at BDO and 52,686 at Grant Thornton, according to IAB.
PwC has spent a billion dollars on cloud computing alone in recent years, dwarfing the IT spend of BDO or Grant Thornton.
BDO and Grant Thornton audited just nine of the 350 top listed companies in Britain, the rest checked by the Big Four, Britain's accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, has said.
(GRAPHIC: Big Four graph - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DjNhCJ) 
FRENCH WAY
KPMG questioned the capability and willingness of smaller auditors to break into the top end of the market.
Big Four officials say privately that smaller rivals benefit from the current situation by having more opportunities to cream off the more lucrative consultancy work, especially now the Big Four won't sell advisory services to audit clients.
Smaller auditors have dismissed this view.
KPMG said that for BDO, Grant Thornton and others to audit big clients they will have to very quickly deliver multiple, large-scale, complex global audit work in a short time.
""Shareholders, audit committees and the regulator must have total confidence in the ability of these firms to complete this work before the market can move ahead with this recommendation,"" KPMG said.
Deloitte's UK managing partner for audit, Stephen Griggs, said joint audits were unproven in Britain and some countries had moved away from them due to big cost increases and little company and investor interest.
""In the only market where joint audits are used extensively, France, the vast majority of audit mandates in the CAC 40 are held by Big Four firms,"" Griggs said.
Joint audits have been in place in France for about 50 years, but only changed the market after regulators ruled in 2011 that they must be ""balanced"", meaning a Big Four firm cannot have the lion's share and leave crumbs for a challenger.
The CMA said only 44 percent of the 120 top listed companies in France are audited by two Big Four firms, and challengers often have around 40 percent of the joint audit.
Companies and investors have already cast doubt on the ability of joint audits to improve audit quality and avoid another Carillion or BHS.
""We remain unconvinced of the value of joint audits, as there is little evidence that they actually lead to the better quality audits that investors want to see,"" said Chris Cummings, chief executive of The Investment Association, which represents asset managers in Britain.
The CMA has said the biggest, most complex companies listed in the UK - estimated to number around 30 - would be exempt from the joint audit requirement. 
Gervase MacGregor, head of risk and reputation at BDO, said market caps on the Big Four would diversify the market faster, a step the CMA considered but has not recommended.
""We will be gearing up and making this commitment,"" MacGregor said, referring to preparing for joint audits. 
He said that over time Big Four audit market share in Britain would stagnate, with BDO already getting job enquiries from Big Four partners who see better promotion prospects at one of the smaller firms in a reverse of the historical situation.
Mandatory joint audits will need legislation and it could take several years before a new law is in place, given parliament is clogged up with Brexit.
By then, BDO and other challengers will have taken on more partners to cope with joint audits and grown their IT investments, MacGregor said.

The CMA is clever in granting companies an exemption from joint audits if they hire a challenger as a sole auditor, MacGregor said. ""We know we will be contacted by a lot of people who want us to take over as sole auditor,"" he said.

544,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 09:44AM ET</span>",Traders ignoring climate change may be in for a shock — and BlackRock says America's aging utilities are most at risk,"Climate change is here.
And investing gurus are sounding the alarm for investors about the looming impact on publicly owned US utilities, which looks to bear the brunt of changes in the earth's climate.  Just look at PG&E.
BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers, says that US utility companies with aging infrastructures are especially underprepared for ""climate shocks,"" and investors should take note.
""Extreme weather risks already threaten utility stocks — and are set to rise in frequency and intensity over time — but are not fully priced in,"" BlackRock  said in a report this month. BlackRock says gas and coal-fired power plants, which make up almost two-thirds of America's generation capacity, are most exposed to risks including wildfires, rising temperatures, flooding, and drought. 
""Electric utilities with exposure to extreme weather events typically suffer temporary price and volatility shocks in the wake of natural disasters,"" BlackRock said.
Raj Thamotheram, who formerly led environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing at pension fund USS, said investors in utilities and other energy producers could face ""significant portfolio damage"" as a result of the sector's ""willful blindness"" and failure to take action on climate risk. Thamotheram also founded a think tank called Preventable Surprises.
Utilities are generally seen as a safe bet for steady, long term returns given their necessity and creditworthiness. They're a favorite of long-term investors including mutual and pension funds.
But this may change going forward. 20 investors with around $1.8 trillion under management wrote to US utilities last month to urge them to decarbonize and upgrade systems, saying that the world was on a path to ""climate disaster.""
Meanwhile on Tuesday, New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest pension fund in the US, looked to decarbonize its holdings, saying that climate is among other notable dangers to the sector. 
""Risks include liability for carbon-emission effects, value depression and demand shifts resulting from innovation and consumer choice,""  the fund said in a recent report.
US investors and insurers are seen to be behind their European counterparts on the issue. 
BlackRock says utility companies will need to invest in upgrading and improving their systems to cope with new conditions. Damages incurred could cause capital losses for investors, though some of this risk can be mitigated through hedging. 
Thamotheram said in an interview: ""It goes beyond green investments, divestment or portfolio decolonization — which does nothing to manage systemic risk — it's about assertively challenging boards and senior management to align business plans with the Paris Agreement."" 
Companies have been making efforts to protect themselves. 
For example, Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) has introduced greater geographic distribution, meaning other areas of its business can cover for losses in the event of hurricane damage. However, this the risk of outage is still damaging as  a recent bout of severe weather proved causing thousands of customers to go without power which hit the company's share price by more than 2% on Tuesday. 
Similarly, as the US's Fourth National Climate Assessment points out, ""major water utilities provide examples of planning that focus on identifying and managing vulnerabilities to a wide range of uncertain future conditions, rather than evaluating performance for a single future.""
A good case study for the impact climate change can have on investors comes from California. It's thought that  the state's temperature has risen by three degrees Fahrenheit on average over the past century with droughts and water shortages increasingly common. 
The fires that scorched thousands of acres of California land and killed scores of people over the past few years have now all but destroyed San Francisco-based utility Pacific Gas and Electric company (PG&E),  which buckled under about $52 billion in debt. PG&E  saw about 75% of its market capitalization wiped out at the end of last year, its CEO step down, its bonds rated junk, and its liabilities may balloon to over $30 billion.
Wildfires and drought-like conditions have exacerbated the state's problems, with some  utilities forced to stop electricity generation from hydropower, due to forced water re-allocations and insufficient water flows — highlighting the scale of the issue already. "

SANT'ELPIDIO A MARE, Italy (Reuters) - Turnaround efforts at Italian luxury group Tod's are starting to bear fruit with e-commerce sales growing at a ""high-double digit"" pace, owner and Chief Executive Diego Della Valle told shareholders on Thursday.
The shoes and leather goods company, famous for its Gommino loafers, has been struggling to revive the appeal of its brands to attract younger luxury shoppers, focusing on digital and more frequent collections and collaborations.
""Our recipe is known and unchanged. We want to keep our long-standing consumers and attract millennials,"" Della Valle, who is also Tod's chairman, said.
""We've got to the operational stage on some fronts and this gives us a little more confidence that the road taken is the right one.""
He added the company, which launched a new business model in late 2017 to reverse falling sales and refresh its namesake brand, could have moved earlier to tackle issues.
""But we're doing what is needed"", he said listing among actions taken a management reshuffle that led to the appointment of a joint-CEO which Della Valle said was working out well.
Online sales, which account for 7 percent of total revenue, are growing at a ""high double digit"" pace and the firm hopes they will keep expanding at this rhythm in one or 1-1/2 years' time so that the contribution to group sales can become more sizeable, Della Valle said.
To complement the online expansion in line with current multi-channel consumer trends, Tod's is also planning to open a new flagship store on Milan's famed Montenapoleone fashion street in a month.
Della Valle said disappointing quarterly earnings were the result of a push to ""achieve sustainable results quite quickly"".
The company, which has fallen short of market expectations in recent years, has said 2019 will be another ""year of transition"" in terms of profitability.
The Della Valle family has been gradually increasing its stake in Tod's as a sign of confidence in the company of which it now owns 63 percent. 

""I'm happy where I am,"" Della Valle said when asked about his role at the company.

Around 10,000 jobs will be cut at Daimler, the business-focused magazine said, without citing sources. 
Daimler declined to comment on the cost savings figure and on Manager Magazin's report but has previously ruled out forced redundancies until the end of 2020.
The magazine said the savings are being sought by Daimler's Ola Kaellenius, who will become Chief Executive in May.
Daimler said in February it would pursue cost saving measures after fourth-quarter operating profit plunged 22 percent, hit by trade wars, rising costs for developing electric cars and an industry downturn.
Manager Magazin said around 30,000 Mercedes-Benz cars with faulty vehicle electronics were produced at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, requiring expensive reworking which was causing production delays.
Those delays had led to a revenue shortfall of around 2 billion euros and could depress first quarter earnings by up to half a billion euros, the report said. 
Daimler is due to release first quarter earnings on April 26. 
Manager Magazin also said Daimler plans to become a carbon neutral company by 2040, ensuring that all new cars, production methods and suppliers work in ways which do not produce carbon dioxide emissions.
Separately, Kaellenius will not renew common projects with French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan, letting an alliance between the carmakers lapse, the magazine said.

The official told Reuters that a former managing partner of Dubai-based Abraaj, Sev Vettivetpillai, had also been arrested and was facing a U.S. extradition request linked to the same charges. 
Vettivetpillai could not be reached for a comment.
Whilst at Abraaj, Vettivetpillai was head of impact investing in a role that oversaw the firm's troubled healthcare fund.
Abraaj's executives are facing U.S. charges that they defrauded their investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that Naqvi and his firm raised money for the Abraaj Growth Markets Health Fund, collecting more than $100 million over three years from U.S.-based charitable organizations and other U.S. investors.
According to the SEC's complaint, Naqvi misappropriated money from the health fund and commingled the assets with corporate funds of Abraaj Investment Management and its parent company, and used it for purposes unrelated to the health fund.
Naqvi, in a statement released through a PR firm, pleaded innocent last week.
Naqvi was arrested in the United Kingdom earlier this month, while managing partner Mustafa Abdel-Wadood was arrested at a New York hotel, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Griswold said at a hearing in Manhattan federal court on April 11.

Dubai's financial services regulator said on Monday that it was in touch with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the latest case involving collapsed private equity firm Abraaj.

The supervisory board is set to decide on a radical restructuring at the end of the month, with hundreds of jobs set to go, particularly at the head office in Ingolstadt, Germany, several people familiar with the process told Reuters.
The sources said the company - under the management of new boss Ferran Reverter - is also reviewing its investments and could even close some down.
Ceconomy - which runs more than 1,000 Media Markt and Saturn stores across Europe - has been battling fierce competition from e-commerce players such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and is trying to better integrate its stores and online range.
Ceconomy appointed a new management team at the end of January, after its chief executive officer quit in October and its chief financial officer left at the end of December.
The company reported tentative signs of recovery in February when it maintained its profit guidance for the fiscal year after posting better-than-expected first-quarter sales, buoyed by Black Friday discount days and upbeat online sales.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Mediaset to make decision on pan-European TV project by July 25 board meeting: CEO,"By Giancarlo Navach
COLOGNO MONZESE, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's Mediaset will make a decision on a possible pan-European free-to-air television alliance by the time of a July 25 board meeting, its chief executive said on Thursday.
The board meeting had already been scheduled to review the broadcaster's decision not to pay a dividend for 2018.
The broadcaster, owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's holding company Fininvest, has in recent months repeatedly raised the idea of creating a pan-European TV player to fend off competition from established rivals and new entrants.
Speaking to reporters after the group's annual general meeting, CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi, who is the son of the former premier, said there were several options for Mediaset's pan-European project.
""Once we have all the elements, we'll understand how to go about this,"" he said.
Most recently, speculation has intensified that Mediaset and German rival ProSiebenSat.1 Media could strike a deal, but the two companies denied last Saturday a press report that they were in merger talks.
Mediaset's Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani told the shareholder meeting there were currently no plans to expand in Germany with ProSiebenSat.
Like other European free-to-air broadcasters, Mediaset is suffering competition from internet giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the advertising market and is struggling to keep up with investments in content production by video-streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video.
France's largest private TV broadcaster, TF1 has also been mentioned in the press as a possible partner for Mediaset, though the company said last September it was not discussing a major cross-border deal with its Italian rival.
Thursday's shareholder meeting approved a loyalty share scheme that rewards longer-term investors with additional votes under an Italian law that is traditionally used by controlling shareholders to strengthen their grip on companies. Fininvest currently owns 44 percent of Mediaset. 
Under the new scheme, investors will have two voting rights for each share held for at least 24 straight months.
Mediaset has been embroiled in a legal battle with hostile shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), the French media conglomerate controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, since 2016 when Vivendi pulled out of a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit.
After the failed pay-TV sale, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns. Vivendi is also the top shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
As Mediaset considers Vivendi's stake illegitimate, its board rejected requests from both the French group and the trust in which it has transferred most of its stake to vote at Thursday's shareholder meeting.

Vivendi said in a statement that it could challenge the validity of the decisions approved by the meeting.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Blackstone to switch from a partnership to a corporation,"By Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation, in a bid to get more investors into its stock.
Blackstone is hoping the move, which will take effect July 1, will boost its share price, which has traded at a discount to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) for more than a decade.
Under the so-called C-Corp structure, Blackstone will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue, in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock.
The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21 percent from 35 percent. 
Two other private equity firms, KKR & Co Inc and Ares Management Corp, announced last year they would also make the switch.
Passive investors such as mutual funds, which are becoming more important as they manage more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring the stock of publicly listed partnerships. 
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees. 
Blackstone said the expanded investor base was worth what it called a ""modest"" tax hit.
""We believe the decision to convert will make it significantly easier for both domestic and international investors to own our stock and should drive greater value for all of our shareholders over time,"" Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said in a statement.
Blackstone also announced first-quarter earnings on Thursday, reporting distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - of $538 million in the first quarter, up from $502 million a year earlier.
This translated to distributable earnings per share of 41 cents, lower than the 51 cents analysts had predicted on average based on Refinitiv data.
Nevertheless, the announcement of the switch to a corporation sent Blackstone shares surging about 10 percent in premarket trading to $39.20.
""We believe this will unlock value, as the partnership structure made it too difficult for many of our long-only clients, and major indexes, to own,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a research note.
Fee-related earnings, the amount Blackstone earns from management fees, were up 11 percent year-on-year at $374 million. 
Blackstone said its assets under management reached $512 billion at the end of March, up 14 percent from a year ago.

Blackstone declared a first-quarter dividend of 37 cents per share.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares erased this week's gains on Thursday after weak manufacturing surveys from Asia and Europe stoked fears of a widespread slowdown in growth, adding to profit-taking ahead of the long Easter weekend.
French and German surveys of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector for April showed activity continuing to contract, hitting European stocks in early trade.
However, short-covering helped Germany's DAX trade half a percent higher by afternoon in London and the pan-European STOXX 600 index was higher 0.2 percent. 
The euro fell to its lowest in over a week after the data, last down 0.3 percent on the day to $1.1253. [FRX/]
German 10-year bond yields were three basis points lower at minus 0.5 percent, dropping further off Wednesday's high of 0.10 percent. 
Activity in Germany's services sector rose to a seven-month high in April, but investors focused on the 44.5 reading for the manufacturing sector, well below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction even if it was above the 44.1 reading last month. 
""Overall, these prints confirm that Europe’s growth engine entered Q2 on a soft footing, and other things equal, they raise the likelihood that the ECB (European Central Bank) may roll out some more stimulus, or at least that any rate hike may be pushed further back,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM.
The weak surveys out of Europe added to a reading of Japanese manufacturing activity which showed new export orders fell at the fastest pace in almost three years.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent on the day. It erased all gains for the week after the German data.
The VIX volatility index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", inched up to 12.61, close to where it was at the start of the week. On Wednesday, the index had fallen to its lowest since August 2018.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were flat.
Market participants are also eyeing signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations.
Washington and Beijing set a tentative timeline for a fresh round of face-to-face meetings ahead of a possible signing ceremony in late May or early June, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
The U.S. trade deficit fell to an eight-month low in February as imports from China plunged, data on Wednesday showed.
Separate figures from China earlier on Wednesday showed the world's second-largest economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying forecasts for a slowdown.
Attention is now turning to how much more stimulus Beijing will apply without triggering more financial risks.
Elsewhere in currencies, the dollar was 0.3 percent higher against a basket of peers at 97.293.
The Australian dollar was 0.3 percent lower at $0.7157. It had earlier jumped to $0.7200 as traders wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia will not rush to ease rates even though the broader economy has seemingly lost momentum.
Oil prices rose slightly, boosted by a decline in U.S. inventories, ongoing supply cuts from OPEC and its allies, and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. 
Brent crude futures were 0.3 percent higher at $71.87 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures were also 0.3 percent higher at $63.97.

556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Goldman Figures Out Best Times to Enter and Exit Earnings Trades,"(Bloomberg) -- As earnings season powers ahead, the question of when to enter and exit stock trades has been answered by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Over the past decade, liquidity has risen before results, then dropped on the day itself as volatility increases and quants stay away, according to calculations from the U.S. bank. In other words, volumes were spurred by anticipation of corporate reports, and volatility fanned by reaction to them.
“The five days preceding the earnings day offer the most attractive days to access liquidity in a single stock,” Goldman strategists led by John Marshall wrote in a note. “Pre-position for earnings moves, but wait until four to six days after to exit.”
The study comes as Goldman has seen an improvement in broad liquidity metrics over the last three months after declines to multi-year lows at the end of 2018. In a research note in December, strategists led by Marshall and Rocky Fishman said the divergence between 2018’s heightened equity volatility and relative economic stability can be explained in large part by illiquidity.
It’s a fear often expressed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), re-stating this month that liquidity and volatility can be connected in a feedback loop that exaggerates price moves.
Marshall’s April note also offered 25 “most differentiated” ideas for the next three months of earnings, where Goldman’s analysts are most out of consensus for the coming quarter and expect shares to move. Firms such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO).,  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN). and Marriott International Inc. make the list of those with upside to estimates, while Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). are among those with most downside.
Also, the consumer discretionary sector provides “usually strong alpha opportunities,” or chances to beat the overall market, because its earnings-day moves have increased recently, the strategists said.
Another big opportunity may lie in the options market, especially given low volatility levels on broad cross-asset metrics.
“The average implied earnings day move ahead of this earnings season is +/-4.1 percent, its lowest level on record,” the strategists wrote. “We see options as unusually attractive given the recent rise in earnings-day volatility. We see low implied moves as evidence that there is limited fear priced into stocks.”

Columna, launched in 2013, was a top-performing fund in a stable known as LFP I SICAV, managed by Luxembourg Fund Partners.
Alter Domus, a Luxembourg fund platform and administrator that has financial backing from private equity giant Permira, bought Luxembourg Fund Partners in December 2017, after Columna's collapse, when LFP I SICAV's assets under management totaled nearly 400 million euros ($450 million).
In a statement released earlier this week, the new directors said they had launched a claim to recover investment losses, management and performance fees from Alter Domus Management Company. LFP I SICAV's assets under management now total around 80 million euros.
Columna made double-digit gains in 2014, 2015 and 2016 investing in a range of commodity products, according to information it sent its investors. But it then closed abruptly in December 2016 without returning any of its assets.
An Alter Domus spokesman said the firm was only aware of ""significant issues"" with Columna between 2013 and 2016 after buying Luxembourg Fund Partners.
The spokesman declined to comment on the legal claim.
In a previous email, he said Alter Domus was looking into the issues with Columna and had ""engaged various external firms to assist with our investigation, the findings of which has led to the commencement of legal actions"". He declined to comment further on the legal actions, saying they were ongoing.
Permira declined to comment.
After being asked by Columna investors to help, asset recovery specialist David Mapley was one of three directors appointed to a new board of LFP I SICAV late last year and authorized by the Luxembourg regulator in February 2019 to take over management of the fund stable from Alter Domus.
Luxembourg's financial regulator declined to comment on individual firms or court cases.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year financial forecast as a boom in air travel drove demand for its aircraft parts used in the airline industry.
The company said adjusted sales rose across all its businesses in the first quarter, led by a 10 percent growth in its aerospace unit, Honeywell's biggest business by revenue.
Higher demand for air travel is driving increased sales of parts such as avionics, braking systems and offerings for high speed internet connectivity in flights, the company said. 
Honeywell is also seeing ""robust demand environment"" for business jets, Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis told Reuters. ""United States has really been the strong point for us in that regard."" 
The company supplies engines, cockpit avionics and other aircraft parts to business jets made by Bombardier Inc and  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT). 
The company has also taken advantage of a boom in e-commerce as it sees rising sales of warehouse automation equipment and software to customers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Sales in safety and productivity solutions unit, which houses the business, rose 9 percent on a reported basis to $1.58 billion in the quarter.
Honeywell expects 2019 sales of $36.5 billion to $37.2 billion, up from $36.0 billion to $36.9 billion estimated previously. Earnings are expected to range between $7.90 and $8.15 per share, compared with its previous forecast of between $7.80 and $8.10 per share.
Honeywell said it had $14 billion in cash available to be deployed in 2019.
""M&A clearly is our first preference in terms of deploying the capital that we do have,"" Lewis said.
""We are definitely thinking more in the bolt-on area again. Bolt-on could be a $2 billion deal. We are not really looking to make the transformational size deal.""
The CFO also said the company repurchased $750 million worth of shares in the first quarter and would have a pretty even share buyback program during the course of the year. 
Honeywell earned $1.92 per share in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.83 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitv.

Revenue fell about 15 percent to $8.88 billion, due to certain divestitures, but was above analysts' estimate of $8.64 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange is poised to deal with a loophole in its warehousing rules, exposed after commodity trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) bought large amounts of aluminum earlier this year, sources familiar with the matter said.
But the exchange will have to wait until a complaint lodged by Glencore with the LME on its inability to take fast delivery of the aluminum from warehouses owned by ISTIM UK in Port Klang, Malaysia has been resolved, sources said.
A problem has emerged in relation to the LME's ""load-in and load-out"" rules - otherwise known as LILO, which specify the tonnage that has to be shipped out when a queue to deliver metal is longer than 50 days.
The rules were introduced after queues to take aluminum out of storage in Detroit soared to near two years in 2014, sparking complaints from consumers in transport and packaging about artificially high aluminum prices.
""The rules were for another era and aimed specifically at cutting those two-year queues. The LME will revisit and change the rules for the current environment,"" an aluminum industry source said. ""Latest events with Glencore and ISTIM have highlighted the problem with LILO.""
The LME, Glencore and ISTIM declined to comment.
Glencore bought 200,000 tonnes of aluminum on the LME in January, creating a queue of more than 50 days at ISTIM's Port Klang facilities at the end of a three-month calculation period ending in January.
The queue would have activated LILO, which stipulates a warehouse must load out its normal requirement and all the metal delivered in over those same three months in March, April and May, which means less rent would be payable by Glencore. 
However Glencore and ISTIM are in dispute over whether the queue started at the end of January or on the first day of February and LILO was not triggered.
If LILO had been triggered at the end of January, ISTIM warehouses in Port Klang would have had to load out 2,500 tonnes a day and another 222,713 tonnes in March, April and May.
""That's an economic benefit for the company making the queue. A company that makes the queue cannot take advantage of QBRC (queue-based rent capping) and should not be able to take advantage of LILO,"" an aluminum trader said.
QBRC specifies that full rent is payable for 30 days and half rent for another 20 days. Rent for metal in a queue to leave a warehouse after 50 days cannot be charged.
However, the company that creates a queue has to pay full rent for as long as it takes to get the metal out. 
""The LME will have to consult on any changes to its warehousing rules, but I don't think anybody will object,"" a source at an aluminum producer said.
""It's a loophole that needs to be closed.""

Any consultation on reforming LILO will be separate to proposals for other changes made by warehousing firms and published by the exchange at the end of March.

Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) are all also due to report before the opening, while ADRs in European consumer giants Nestle (OTC:NSRGY) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) may both catch a bid after the two companies reported stronger-than-expected organic sales growth earlier Thursday.
Image-sharing social media company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange a day after it raised approximately $1.4 billion in its initial public offering. That was above the top end of its range but still well below the valuation implicit in its last private funding round.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) is evaluating the revenue potential from supplying parts to Boeing's next major aircraft program, which is likely to be finalized by late 2019 or early next year, Chief Financial Officer Greg Lewis told Reuters.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has signaled that the proposed new mid-sized jetliner, known as NMA, will accelerate its drive to diversify beyond airframes and into services such as repairs and maintenance, where parts suppliers make much of their revenue.
""If Boeing decides to move forward on the NMA ... we feel like we have got some very competitive offerings that we could provide on a platform,"" Lewis said.
""But it would have to be done in a way where it's a good project for Honeywell and we are able to protect our intellectual property.""
Honeywell makes auxiliary power units, cockpit avionics and flight management systems for the aerospace industry.
Lewis also said that China's C919 passenger jet program, manufactured by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), was progressing well and was likely to meet its target of first deliveries in the next three or four years.
Honeywell is supplying parts for the narrowbody jet, which will compete directly with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 aircraft.
There were reports that the C919 program was having problems with its flight deck design, raising concerns that the new jet would miss its target of entry into service by 2021.

""We are bullish on how that's (the C919 program) going. Our equipment has performed well. As far as we can tell, they are on track for that 2021-22 type of entry into service date,"" Lewis said.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Hong Kong Airlines power struggle deepens amid allegations head office 'stormed',"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A power struggle at Hong Kong Airlines (HKA) intensified on Thursday as a group of shareholders accused a rival group representing indebted Chinese conglomerate HNA of storming the troubled airline's head office and taking away documents.
Both groups also again staked claim to the chairmanship of the carrier.
Former HKA director Zhong Guosong and Chinese private equity firm Frontier Investment Partner, who together control about 61 percent of the airline, said in a statement that ""HNA Group representatives stormed"" the carrier's office early on Thursday morning.
""It is believed that HKA’s key financial information and hard disks were taken away or destroyed, with the specific losses still unknown,"" they said, adding the move took place in spite of an agreement between the two sides reached late on Wednesday to not remove documents. 
However, HKA said via a spokesman: ""No one broke into our headquarters or took away any company document this morning.""
HNA, which holds about 29 percent of HKA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Around eight security guards were visible in the lift lobby outside HKA's head office, and in reception, when Reuters visited on Thursday afternoon. They declined to say who they worked for.
Multiple HKA staff approached by Reuters outside the head office declined to comment. Two, however, said that ""all is normal"" at the airline.
In a statement, HKA said: ""The recent dispute among the company’s shareholders has seriously disrupted the order and operation of our office. As a result, we had to hire third-party security personnel and lawyers to assist us in dealing with the situation.""
The power struggle first went public on Tuesday when Frontier and Zhong, who hold 34 and 27 percent of HKA, respectively, said they had held an extraordinary shareholder meeting where they removed the existing directors and installed Zhong, already chairman of sister airline Hong Kong Express, as chairman.
This was disputed on Wednesday by Hou Wei, who is still listed on HKA's website as chairman and who said in a memo to staff that he was still in charge of the airline.
Hou joined Hong Kong Airlines in September last year following more than four years with HNA's Hainan Airlines, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. Hainan Airlines is China's fourth largest carrier.
The fight comes as HKA is struggling to survive. Earlier this month, executives warned shareholders the company needed at least HK$2 billion ($255 million) or risk losing its operating license - and that it swung to a loss of about HK$3 billion last year.
Zhong and Frontier representatives at that meeting, however, demanded details of the 2018 accounts and questioned the close ties between HKA and HNA, which cut its controlling stake in the Hong Kong carrier in 2017.
Zhong and Frontier said on Thursday that the two sides had agreed that security personnel appointed by them could remain in the offices to safeguard documents and that executives promised to not destroy or remove information or data, or remove it from the office. 

The two shareholders, who maintained that Zhong is chairman, added that they were ""fully committed to exercising every possible legal means they have to act"" to protect the interests of the airline's employees, customers and business partners.

570,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Respite for banks as payouts for mis-sold insurance fall,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's lenders are starting to put the most costly consumer scandal to hit the industry behind it, with payouts for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) falling in the second half of 2018 ahead of an August deadline for claims.
Firms paid 1.99 billion pounds ($2.59 billion) in compensation to customers for mis-sold PPI over the period, down 14 percent on the first half of the year and 3 percent lower than the same period in 2017.
The number of complaints about PPI also fell, down 8 percent on the first half to 1.72 million, according to the latest figures from watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority published on Thursday.
This helped pull down the overall number of complaints against financial firms by 5 percent. 
The slowdown in PPI complaints will come as a relief for banks, including RBS (LON:RBS) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY), which have already paid out more than 30 billion pounds in redress to customers since 2007.
PPI policies were meant to protect borrowers in the event of sickness or unemployment but were often sold to those who would have been ineligible to claim.
PPI claims had previously surged following an FCA advertising campaign launched in August 2017 featuring the animatronic head of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, ahead of this August's deadline.
Despite the fall, PPI remained the most complained about product, accounting for 40 percent of all complaints.
Complaints about current accounts also fell 13 percent, after a jump in the first half in part caused by a major IT failure at challenger bank TSB, a subsidiary of Spain's Sabadell.
Complaints about credit cards, the third most complained about product, bucked the trend rising 10 percent.
Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: “It is encouraging to see that complaint figures have dropped and firms are dealing with complaints more quickly.""

(Reuters) - European shares were little changed on Thursday as strong quarterly results from  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Nestle tempered data showing euro zone businesses unexpectedly slowed this month. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.01 percent by 0940 GMT, retreating from an eight-month high and set to snap a six-day winning streak ahead of the Easter holiday. 
Losses in bank-heavy Milan and Madrid indexes led declines, while Germany's DAX edged higher.
The yield on the German 10-year bund fell further after flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data unexpectedly fell to 51.3, a downturn led again by the bloc's manufacturing industry.
The data came on the heels of the German government lowering its forecast for 2019 economic growth on Wednesday, which was overshadowed by better-than-expected economic data out of China. 
""We ... have confirmation that we are in a bit of a weak spot in Europe, if you look at the services sector and the composite PMI, and this is the reason why you're seeing stock markets in Europe soften,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at CityIndex.
""But I think the PMI data is the wrong data at the right time. We are coming to the end of a very short week,"" Odeluga added.
Also due are retail sales data and flash PMIs from the United States.
Bank stocks fell 0.7 percent, their steepest loss in three weeks.
Shares in Osram were among the biggest percentage losers on the STOXX 600 after a German magazine reported that private equity groups Bain and Carlyle were losing confidence in their bid for the lighting group.
SIGNS OF SLOWDOWN
 Kering  (PA:PRTP) dropped 3.6 percent and weighed heavily on France's CAC 40 after signs of a slowdown at the French fashion company's Gucci brand, particularly in the United States.
Top gainer in Germany's DAX was  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn), after the Federal Network Agency cleared the way for the postal company to significantly increase the cost of sending letters after the company pledged to hire an extra 5,000 delivery workers.
Not all earnings were disappointing. The food and beverage sector raked in a 1 percent rise, the most among European sectors, lifted by upbeat earnings from Nestle.
The food group's shares advanced after it maintained its full-year forecast after good momentum in the United States and China.
London and Amsterdam-listed shares of Unilever topped the STOXX 600 after the consumer goods group reported stronger than expected quarterly underlying sales growth, helped by increased prices and volume.
Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) rose after the French company beat first-quarter revenue estimates.
Lab equipment maker Sartorius Stedim Biotech rose 3 percent after it maintained full-year guidance as first-quarter revenue rose. 

French vouchers and card provider  Edenred  (PA:EDEN) gained 2.3 percent after keeping its outlook for 2019 unchanged. Rival Sodexo (PA:EXHO) was up 0.5 percent.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Jet Airways shares plunged on Thursday, battered by worries about whether the grounded Indian airline would fly again, while carriers such as SpiceJet rushed in to plug a supply gap in the wake of their rival's demise.
Once India's largest private airline, Jet halted all flight operations indefinitely on Wednesday evening after lenders led by the State Bank of India declined to extend more funds to keep the carrier going.
Investors punished Jet shares on Thursday, driving them down 34 percent in their biggest intraday fall. The company is worth about $260 million now, versus $1.6 billion at its peak in 2005.
The carrier, saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of bank debt, has been teetering for weeks after failing to receive a stop-gap loan of about $217 million from its lenders, as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.
While lenders are ""reasonably hopeful"" a bidding process for an up to 75 percent stake in the airline will end successfully, investors - according to Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics - have doubts over whether a successful deal will be completed.
Jet's ""value is dwindling with each passing day"", he said.
However, the crisis at Jet, long the biggest operator in Mumbai, has opened a window of opportunity for other airlines.
""Rivals are looting available slots because of Jet's shutdown,"" Edelweiss Securities analyst Vijayant Gupta said.
Jet's slots will be allocated to other airlines based on factors including fleet and staff strength, a civil aviation ministry source said on condition of anonymity.
Once allotted, an airline can keep the slot for one flying season or six months and Jet can reclaim the slots if it is revived by the end of the flying season, the source said.
The current flying season ends on Oct. 26, according to the Indian aviation regulator's website.
""We are assisting airlines and airports to bring in capacity rapidly to ensure that fares remain stable and competitive,"" India's Ministry of Aviation said on Twitter on Wednesday.
It is meeting with airports and airlines on Thursday.
A gap in capacity has pushed up fares by 30-40 percent since September in India, ratings agency ICRA has said.
India's biggest airline IndiGo has been rapidly inducting new Airbus SE A320neos into its fleet in recent months.
Low-cost airline SpiceJet Ltd has pledged to add 27 planes over the next two weeks, adding it would launch 24 new flights from Mumbai and Delhi over the period.
""The industry is currently facing severe shortage of capacity and SpiceJet remains committed to make all possible efforts to minimize passenger inconvenience,"" said Ajay Singh, SpiceJet's chairman and managing director.
SpiceJet shares rose as much as 15 percent to the highest since February 2018 early on Thursday. Shares in IndiGo's parent InterGlobe Aviation rose 3 percent.
LENDERS ""REASONABLY HOPEFUL""
At its peak, Jet operated over 120 planes and well over 600 daily flights. The airline, which has roughly 16,000 employees, has in recent weeks been forced to cancel hundreds of flights and to halt all flights out of India as funds dried up.
""The best way forward for the survival of Jet Airways is to get the binding bids from potential investors who have expressed EOI and have been issued bid documents on 16th April,"" Jet's lenders said, referring to expressions of interest.
They added that they were ""reasonably hopeful"" the bid process will be successful in determining Jet's fair value.
CNBC-TV18 reported on Tuesday that Jet's lenders were set to invite binding bids from four shortlisted suitors that include private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, Indian wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), and Etihad Airways, which already owns a minority stake in Jet.
Etihad did not respond to a request for comment outside usual business hours.
""Ultimately Jet's share price will hinge on what sort of haircut lenders take. That will dictate the equity value of the company,"" Edelweiss' Gupta said.
Shares in Jet's lead lender, State Bank of India, fell 1.9 percent on Thursday.
Jet's failure would be a blow to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently seeking re-election in a weeks' long general election. Modi's critics blame his government for rising unemployment.
Lenders wanted to keep Jet operating but declined to extend the stop-gap loan to the carrier partly due to concerns over whether there had been any regulatory violations, a source at one of the banks said on condition of anonymity.

""We do not know right now if there are any regulatory violations in the company. If in the future someone finds that some rules were violated, then it could get us all in trouble,"" the source said. ""You do not know how these things work out.""

576,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",Nestle and Unilever Raise Prices Without Stunting Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s consumer-goods giants are showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies, even at higher prices.
Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) surprised investors with strong starts to the year, reporting first-quarter sales growth that handily topped analysts’ estimates. The Swiss maker of KitKat bars and the Anglo-Dutch owner of Dove soap each cited a combination of improved pricing and higher volumes.
Unilever rose as much as 3.6 percent in Amsterdam as Nestle traded as much as 1.3 percent higher in Zurich.
The companies delivered a counterpoint to the cost-cut-driven performance of U.S. rival Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co., which has slumped since a profit warning and asset write-down in February -- about two years after it made an unsuccessful approach to take over Unilever. Instead, the European multinationals joined U.S. peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. in selling more of their products. The companies also successfully passed higher raw-materials costs on to consumers.
At Nestle, for example, the pricing gain of 1.2 percent was the biggest in 10 quarters. The businesses most hit by inflation included bottled water, with higher oil prices making plastic and transport more expensive. Unilever also noted higher costs of petrochemicals such as linear alkylbenzene, an ingredient in biodegradable detergents, along with increased prices for raw materials in the food sector.
On Wednesday,  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) forecast milk-price inflation in high single digits this year, plus more expensive sugar and fruit. While sugar prices have risen over the past year, other commodities such as cocoa and coffee have fallen.
“What companies like ourselves face is the impact of the input-costs increases and commodity-driven gains on the ground,” Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said by phone. PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said earlier this week that the drinks and snacks giant expects commodity inflation to increase over the rest of the year.
While Europe and Japan are suffering from stubbornly low price increases or even deflation, higher rates of inflation are popping up in places like Turkey and Argentina. Moroccan consumers have held an informal boycott of Danone products via social media over the past year to protest what consumers see as unfair prices.
While managing to raise prices, Nestle and Unilever also benefited by expanding into new areas as their old-line brands stagnate. Sales in Unilever’s home-care division, which grew at about twice the pace of the group figure, were driven in part by more eco-conscious products under the company’s Seventh Generation and Omo laundry brands. Acquisitions the Anglo-Dutch company has made since 2015 collectively grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter.
Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has signed $14 billion of deals in 2018. The food giant has also been trying to fix or sell underperformers, with a sale for its Herta lunch-meat unit possibly coming by midyear and its dermatological business by year-end.
Beating Estimates
Nestle’s revenue climbed 3.4 percent on an organic basis in the first quarter, as Schneider beat the 2.8 percent analyst consensus by the biggest margin since he started leading the world’s largest food company in 2017.
At Unilever, underlying sales rose 3.1 percent in the quarter. As with Nestle, analysts had expected 2.8 percent.
A smaller consumer-focused company,  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) SA, joined in the optimism on Thursday. While it missed sales-growth estimates for its fiscal third quarter, the French distiller raised its forecast for full-year growth in operating profit to about 8 percent from a range of 6 percent to 8 percent.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>",Facebook says it uploaded email contacts of up to 1.5 million users,"(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday it may have ""unintentionally uploaded"" email contacts of 1.5 million new users since May 2016, in what seems to be the latest privacy-related issue faced by the social media company.
In March, Facebook had stopped offering email password verification as an option for people who signed up for the first time, the company said. There were cases in which email contacts of people were uploaded to Facebook when they created their account, the company said.
""We estimate that up to 1.5 million people's email contacts may have been uploaded. These contacts were not shared with anyone and we are deleting them,"" Facebook told Reuters, adding that users whose contacts were imported will be notified. 
The underlying glitch has been fixed, according to the company statement.
Business Insider had earlier reported that the social media company harvested email contacts of the users without their knowledge or consent when they opened their accounts.
When an email password was entered, a message popped up saying it was ""importing"" contacts without asking for permission first, the report said. 
Facebook has been hit by a number of privacy-related issues recently, including a glitch that exposed passwords of millions of users stored in readable format within its internal systems to its employees.
Last year, the company came under fire following revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, obtained personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles without their consent. 
The company has also been facing criticism from lawmakers across the world for what has been seen by some as tricking people into giving personal data to Facebook and for the presence of hate speech and data portability on the platform. 

Separately, Facebook was asked to ensure its social media platform is not abused for political purposes or to spread misinformation during elections.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are struggling to add to recent gains Thursday, as a new round of business surveys suggest that the region’s manufacturing sector is still struggling to emerge from the slowdown of the last six months.
At 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.12 points, or 0.3% at 388.46. The U.K. FTSE 100 and Germany’s Dax index were both also down 0.3%, while Italy’s FTSE MIB was the biggest loser, slipping 0.8% after the country’s central bank warned that its budget deficit is likely to be much wider than agreed with the EU in the next couple of years.
Flash readings of purchasing manager indexes for French and German manufacturing both fell short of expectations in April, although Germany’s did rise for the first time in nine months. Meanwhile, the equivalent French index fell surprisingly, with new orders continuing to decline. In both countries, readings from the services sector continued to be much better, with Germany’s reaching a six-month high.
“German manufacturing and service sectors are currently living in two different worlds,” said Nordea Markets analyst Jan von Gerich. “While any rebound is welcome news, the outlook for German manufacturing still looks horrible.”
The macro data have overshadowed a couple of impressive quarterly reports from consumer giants Nestle (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR).
The Swiss giant has hit a new all-time high, continuing the tear it’s been on since the start of the year. Organic sales growth hit 3.4% in the first quarter, well ahead of the 2.8% consensus forecast, thanks not least to its baby food and pet food operations. The group is also advancing its reviews of its skin-care and processed meat operations, raising hopes that it will raise more cash for shareholders through disposals in the coming year.
Nestle’s great Anglo-Dutch rival Unilever released figures that weren’t quite as convincing. Organic sales rose only 3.1%, adjusted for M&A activity, and 1.9 percentage points of that was due to price increases rather than sales volume. The company still managed to increase its dividend by 6%, however, and chief executive Alain Jope said that its acquisitions over the last three years – which aim to ensure that the company stays abreast of changing consumer tastes – collectively grew by “double-digits”. Jope also forecast that sales would be “in the lower half” of its target range of 3%-5% for the whole of 2019."
579,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 04:08AM ET</span>",U.S. antitrust scrutiny tests T-Mobile's $26 billion bet on Sprint,"By Carl O'Donnell and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc's $26 billion deal to buy Sprint Inc banked on changes in wireless technology and media streaming to win U.S. antitrust approval, but the bet now looks precarious. 
Growing skepticism from the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust staff over the impact of the merger on competition in the market will test the resolve of the companies to complete the deal that would see the top U.S. wireless carriers shrink to three from four. 
While the Department of Justice has yet to reach a decision on whether to approve the deal, it is pushing Sprint and T-Mobile for evidence that the merger would be in the interest of U.S. consumers, people familiar with the matter said this week. 
The deal would be the third major attempt in less than a decade to consolidate the U.S. wireless market, after AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's $39 billion deal to buy T-Mobile in 2011 was blocked, and Sprint and T-Mobile abandoned a previous attempt to negotiate a merger in 2014 following regulatory opposition.
If completed, the deal would create a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No.2 wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T, respectively. 
""It is time to acknowledge that the odds of the deal are less than a coin toss,"" said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at Moffett Nathanson, in a note. 
Sprint shares are down more than 6 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the merger is unlikely to be approved as currently structured, despite T-Mobile CEO John Legere tweeting that the premise of the story was ""simply untrue"".
Sprint and T-Mobile are arguing that the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry has changed substantially since 2014, when they last attempted to merge.
The changes include the development of ultra-fast 5G networks, Sprint's struggles to operate on its own given its swelling debt load, and the marriage of telecommunications infrastructure with media production, as epitomized in AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
These changes, as well as the companies' belief that the current Department of Justice antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, will take a more generous view of the deal than past leadership did, gave the two companies the confidence to take another shot at merging last year, they added. 
Antitrust staff at the Department of Justice have taken a skeptical stance, however. They have been asking for more information about the extent of Sprint's challenges as a standalone company, the two companies' plans to merge their wireless network, and the benefits of the merger for the companies' planned 5G network buildout, the sources said.
T-Mobile has also been very efficient in cutting prices for consumers, and there are questions within the Department of Justice whether this would continue after a merger with Sprint, the sources added.
In a sign of the regulatory challenges facing the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint did not agree to any breakup fee should regulators scuttle the merger.
KEEPING UP WITH RIVALS
Sprint, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has struggled to keep pace with rivals, hemorrhaging cash and losing subscribers despite price cuts designed to keep pace with T-Mobile, which has been steadily gaining market share from rivals. T-Mobile is majority owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn). 
At the same time, China has poured vast amounts of money into the development of 5G networks, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to prioritize the rollout of the technology in the United States.
Meanwhile, AT&T's Time Warner deal, and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR), which developed wireless offerings to compete with T-Mobile and Sprint, increased some telecommunication companies' ability to bundle wireless plans with other offerings, including streaming video content. 
That has increased pressure on T-Mobile and Sprint to increase investment in their own networks, which they can afford to do more if they gain scale through the merger.

T-Mobile acquired cable company Layer3 TV in 2017 and rolled out its own television service in 2018. That combination of content and wireless plans, the companies have argued to regulators, could position a combined company as a more serious competitor to companies such as AT&T that offer bundled services.

580,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",Commerzbank Suitors Line Up as Deutsche Bank Discussions Drag On,"(Bloomberg) -- As merger talks between  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) appear to run into more obstacles, potential suitors are jockeying for a piece of the German banking market should government efforts to create a national champion fail.
Commerzbank, the smaller of the two, is attracting the most interest, perhaps because it would be easier to digest. Dutch lender  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV has reached out to the bank and the German government to seek talks, and UniCredit SpA is weighing a potential bid, people familiar with the matter have said.
The German Finance Ministry, which oversees the country’s roughly 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, has encouraged the firm’s negotiations with Deutsche Bank.
Yet some within Germany’s government -- which owns roughly 15 percent of Commerzbank -- are critical of a national merger and would prefer a European solution. But the lack of a European deposit insurance scheme and a still-fragmented capital market in the region are posing big hurdles for a cross-border takeover. That’s less of a problem for banks that already have a large presence in the German market and are looking to expand there.
Here are some potential suitors that have emerged or are likely to emerge for Commerzbank should its talks with Deutsche Bank collapse:
ING Groep
Ralph Hamers, chief executive officer of the biggest Dutch bank, has reached out to his Commerzbank counterpart, Martin Zielke, and to the German government in an effort to start discussions. Hamers even pledged to cut fewer jobs than a Commerzbank-Deutsche Bank deal would require, and to move ING’s headquarters to Frankfurt from Amsterdam, according to Manager Magazin, which first reported the talks. Zielke rejected formal discussions but hasn’t broken off contact completely, the publication said.
ING already ranks among the biggest retail banks in Germany with more than 8 million customers, and its online-only strategy there might fit well with Commerzbank’s Comdirect business. A deal would also bolster ING’s push into corporate banking in Germany. The potential to cut costs is lower because ING doesn’t have any branches in Germany.
UniCredit
Italy’s UniCredit has considered making a bid for Commerzbank and could approach the German lender if talks with Deutsche Bank fall apart, a person familiar with the matter said. The multibillion-euro plan under deliberation involves buying a sizable stake in Commerzbank and merging it with HypoVereinsbank, which UniCredit already owns, according to the Financial Times, which broke the news.
A representative for UniCredit declined to comment.
A takeover would probably face opposition from the German government because of UniCredit’s significant exposure to Italian sovereign debt, so a transaction would probably require a complex structure. UniCredit executives held discussions with German officials about Commerzbank in 2017, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
Combining HypoVereinsbank with Commerzbank would give Unicredit (MI:CRDI) or any other buyer greater access to the so-called Mittelstand companies, or the mid-sized businesses that are the backbone of the German economy.
BNP Paribas
Like UniCredit,  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) is said to have held talks already in 2017 with the German government about buying its stake in Commerzbank. The French lender emerged largely unscathed from the turmoil that rocked its European peers over the past decade, and banking executives have speculated that CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafe may now consider dealmaking to accelerate his expansion.
A takeover of Commerzbank would create a Franco-German entity that dwarfs Deutsche Bank in terms of revenue and earnings. A spokeswoman for BNP said the bank has no acquisition plans.
Santander
 Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA executives would be interested in making an approach if they believe the price to be right, people familiar with the matter said. They find Commerzbank appealing because it could help buttress their expansion in Europe, the people said. The Spanish lender is the largest bank in the euro zone, and could potentially digest Commerzbank even after paying a premium for the asset.
Like ING and UniCredit, Santander is already present in Germany, and its focus on consumer lending could square with that of Commerzbank. Chairman Ana Botin has said that “consolidation is going to happen” though banks would need an integrated European market for services for cross-border banking to work. Botin didn’t specifically address a potential Commerzbank tie-up and a spokesman declined further comment.
SocGen
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA is among European lenders that have weighed whether to make an approach to Commerzbank if German consolidation plans don’t succeed, a person familiar with the matter said. There’s no certainty the French lender will make an approach, the person said.
Earlier this month, SocGen Chairman Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the bank “wants to be a protagonist” in European cross-border consolidation, which he said was important for financial stability of the euro area and to compete with U.S. rivals. His firm is the only one among France’s top three banks that doesn’t have a retail base in another euro-area country.
A SocGen spokesman said the bank wouldn’t comment on market rumors.
UBS
UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber in Davos told the world elite that European banking needs consolidation, though he also said that his firm wouldn’t participate.
A purchase of Commerzbank could give the Swiss bank access to top business customers in Germany, while also adding a new base of potential clients for UBS’s wealth business. But UBS, which was bailed out by the Swiss government after the financial crisis, may face opposition to any large acquisitions from its own regulators.
A spokesman for UBS declined to comment.

581,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",Aramco Hype Meets Reality as Bonds Drop After Unprecedented Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- The slump in Aramco bonds since its unprecedented debt sale this month makes one thing clear: you can’t take the Saudi out of Saudi Aramco.
Demand was so great, with bids topping $100 billion, that the energy giant managed to raise $12 billion at lower yields than the kingdom itself, which is uncommon in corporate bond markets. Investors are now paying the price for that discrepancy: all five maturities have fallen since trading started last week, in some cases by more than 2 cents on the dollar.
“We view the company as more of a Saudi risk rather than just an energy company,” said Patrick Wacker, a fund manager at Singapore-based UOB Asset Management Ltd. who dumped his holdings on the first day of trading to profit from the initial euphoria. He predicts the debt will keep falling until it trades at a yield premium to the Saudi government.
If he’s right, there’s still a ways to go before the Aramco bond selloff is over. The company’s $3 billion of notes due in 2029 yielded 3.78 percent on Wednesday, less than the 3.91 percent on similar-maturity Saudi government debt sold in January.
Given the order size at the sale, many investors expected the world’s biggest oil producer, known officially as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., would get away with lower yields than the government and instead be compared with global peers such as London-based  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, whose notes due in 2028 yielded 3.51 percent Wednesday.
That’s not an unreasonable assumption. With $111.1 billion of net income in 2018, Aramco ranks as the most profitable company in the world. Even Moody’s Investors Service said this month it’s a contender for its top Aaa rating, yet ""close interlinkages"" with the sovereign prompted it to grade Aramco in line with the Saudi government, which is ranked four steps lower at A1.
“If it weren’t for its postcode it would most likely have come even tighter,"" Anders Faergemann, a fund manager in London at PineBridge Investments, which oversees about $90 billion and owns Aramco bonds, said of the pricing. “Aramco is a bit of special case as it stirred interest from all types of investors, not just your usual emerging-market investors.""
Saudi Jewel
Aramco is integral to the economy of Saudi Arabia, which has been ramping up debt sales in recent years as falling oil prices left it with budget deficits. The oil industry accounted for more than 60 percent of the kingdom’s revenue in 2017 and about half of Aramco’s board is comprised of government officials. The money raised is also being used to finance Saudi Arabia’s economic agenda after the state postponed until at least 2021 plans to sell a stake in Aramco in an initial public offering.
Some investors who spoke to Bloomberg said a number of bondholders trimmed their positions because they had inflated the size of their initial orders to ensure they’d get a slice of the offering. Others sold because their allocations were too small to make a difference to their portfolios, they said.
The 2029 notes were trading at 97.67 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, compared with an issue price of 99.516.
“We did not participate in the new deal as they priced inside the sovereign,"" said Wouter Van Overfelt, a Zurich-based senior money manager at Vontobel Asset Management. ""While there may be good reasons for this to be the case, we would generally prefer the sovereign in such cases.""
Roadshow Success
Still, investors such as PineBridge in London and TCW Group Inc. in Los Angeles say they are staying put, expecting volatility will eventually ease. The bonds were particularly vulnerable to the recent selloff in U.S. Treasuries, but the long-term fundamentals of the company make it worth the risk, they say.
“Aramco’s new bonds seem to be a victim of the roadshow’s success,” said Brett Rowley, TCW’s managing director for emerging markets. “Our view on Aramco’s debt remains constructive. It’s a world-class oil producer, which trades wide to international peers.”
Even so,Wacker at UOB Asset Management, which oversees about $24 billion, said the price drop could leave a bitter taste with investors given all the initial hype.
“This may not have been the best way to start a capital-markets relationship with bond investors,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) is having regular and ""courteous"" talks with activist investor Elliott, although it is not necessarily meeting Elliott any more than it would with any other regular shareholder, the head of Pernod told Reuters.
""There is a regular dialogue between the teams, but we do not see them more than other shareholders. My ambition remains to deliver on our strategic plan, that's my motto,"" CEO Alexandre Ricard said in a telephone interview.
Pernod, which is the world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE), is under pressure from New York hedge fund Elliott Management to improve profit margins and corporate governance.
In February, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year plan that Elliott described as a first small step.
When asked about speculation that Pernod could sell the whole or part of its wine business, Ricard replied: ""Pernod Ricard has the firm intention to continue to actively manage its portfolio, in terms of either selling or buying.""
Last month Bloomberg reported Pernod was considering the sale of its wine division, which includes Australian brand Jacob's Creek and Spain's Campo Viejo and makes roughly 5 percent of group sales.
Ricard, whose company makes Havana Club rum in Cuba, added he was ""not worried"" about Pernod's business in Cuba, despite latest moves by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
The Trump administration is lifting a long-standing ban against U.S. citizens filing lawsuits against foreign companies that use properties seized by Cuba’s Communist government since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.

The major policy shift, which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billion of dollars, is intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding an end to Cuban support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>",Nestle upbeat after U.S. and China boost first-quarter growth,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle posted higher-than-expected sales growth in the first three months of the year after good momentum in the United States and China, putting it on track to meet its goal of more than 3 percent organic growth this year.
The world's biggest food group, with brands such as Maggi soup and KitKat bars, said its biggest markets, the United States and China, had shown a strong trend in the quarter, with the largest contributions from pet care, dairy and infant nutrition. 
Nestle and its peers are trying to buck a consumer trend toward fresh, locally produced foods, which has hit sales of packaged goods, by focusing on fast-growing categories like infant formula and coffee.
The company based in Vevey in western Switzerland said organic or self-generated sales growth accelerated to 3.4 percent in the first quarter, ahead of the average 2.8 percent in an Infront Data poll of analysts and 2.8 percent a year ago.
""Our increased speed, innovation for a changing world and execution focus are clearly paying off,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider said in a statement on Thursday. ""We confirm our outlook for the year.""
Nestle also said efforts to gear its portfolio more toward health and wellness, and fix or dispose of underperforming brands, were on track. It expects strategic reviews of its skin health and Herta meats businesses to be completed by mid- and late-2019 respectively.
GROWTH EXPECTATIONS 
Sales volume growth held up well in the quarter and pricing improved, thanks to price increases in Brazil and the United States, Nestle said. China maintained mid single-digit growth thanks notably to premium infant formula and Nescafe.
Acquisitions of a license to sell Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee and of Atrium Innovations, which are not included in organic growth, helped increase overall sales to 22.2 billion Swiss francs ($22 billion).
Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the statement had shown measures taken last year were starting to pay off, and said growth expectations would go up. He renewed his ""buy"" recommendation on the stock.
Nestle shares, which have already gained over 19 percent this year, were indicated to open 1.4 percent higher, according to Julius Baer pre-market data.
French yogurt maker Danone posted underlying quarterly sales growth of 0.8 percent on Wednesday, hit by setbacks in China and Morocco, but said it expected sales growth to accelerate from the second quarter.
Anglo-Dutch  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) said on Thursday underlying sales grew 3.1 percent in the first quarter. 
Johan Utterman, who manages a fund for Lombard Odier IM, said he thought Schneider was doing a good job. 

""Divesting lower-growth, lower-margin, lower-return-on- invested-capital businesses and buying higher ones. So I think it's all heading in the right direction,"" Utterman said.

Gou, Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, said on Wednesday he would join the already competitive presidential race, and take part in the opposition, China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) primary elections.
Foxconn in a statement on Tuesday said Gou would remain chairman, though he planned to withdraw from his company's daily operations.
On Wednesday, it said daily operations are handled by a team of professional managers, indicating that business would continue as usual.
""In terms of economic fundamentals, Taiwan stocks are not bad,"" said Cathay Futures Vice-President Anderson Chien.
""If Gou runs for the election, the market may draw parallels to the rally in the U.S. stock market after U.S. President Trump won in 2016,"" Chien said, referring to Donald Trump similarly being a businessman before turning attention to the presidency.
Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, climbed as much as 5.9 percent to T$97.20, the highest since October 2018. The stock is up more than 8 percent so far this week.
Handset maker and Foxconn unit FIH Mobile Ltd jumped as much as 58 percent to HK$2.23, its highest since February 2018, and was on track for its sixth consecutive session of gain. The stock has soared more than 100 percent so far this week, heading for its best week since its February 2005 listing.
""Punters are excited by the news and that boosted the stocks of the group of companies,"" said Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance. However, he said, a correction - when a stock price falls as investors in tandem sell at a profit - could come at any time.
FIH's stock ranked as the second-biggest percentage gainer in early trade, tracking a rally in its parent Foxconn. It has outperformed the Hang Seng Commerce & Industry Index sector by 55.2 percentage points in the past month. 
Shares in Foxconn Industrial Internet Co Ltd, a subsidiary of Foxconn, soared to the maximum-allowed limit of 10 percent, hitting their highest since June 2018.
Foxconn Industrial has jumped 25 percent this week and nearly 70 percent so far this year, far outpacing the broad market.

The Hong Kong-listed shares of Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd, Hon Hai's electronic and optoelectronic connectors maker unit, rose as much as 14.3 pct to the highest since February 2018. The stock is up 15 percent this week.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 01:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Advent readies new $2.2 billion Latam private equity fund - sources,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Advent International Corp is preparing to launch a $2.2 billion fund to invest in Latin American companies, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The fund launched in coming days will be Advent's seventh for Latin America and its largest for the region. Advent's last Latin American fund reached $2.1 billion in commitments in 2014.
Advent declined to comment on the matter.
Advent has invested in companies in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru. The firm intends to close the fund-raising by September, according to one of the sources, who asked for anonymity because discussions are still private.
Advent's move underscores how long-term investors have not soured on Latin America despite weaker growth and political risks, betting on rebounding growth in coming years as the International Monetary Fund forecasts.
One of Advent's largest bets in Latin America was the acquisition of an 80 percent stake in the Brazilian operations of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc in June.
The world's biggest retailer did not receive payment for the unit and took a non-cash charge of roughly $4.5 billion. Advent agreed to invest 1.9 billion reais ($483 million) to turn around the geographically sprawling and poorly integrated operations.
Advent, which had $36 billion in assets under management in December, has raised more than $6 billion in private equity funds for Latin America since 1996.
Its portfolio in Latin America also includes Argentine card processor Prisma Medios de Pagos SA, Brazilian education company Estácio Participações SA and Peruvian IT outsourcer Canvia.

592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>","Indonesian Stocks, Rupiah Climb as Jokowi Wins Second Term","(Bloomberg) -- Indonesian stocks and the rupiah jumped after unofficial results showed Joko Widodo defeating Prabowo Subianto by a comfortable margin, set for his second term as president of the world’s third-largest democracy.
Seven top private polling agencies had Widodo, known as Jokowi, ahead of Prabowo by at least seven percentage points with about 99 percent of the vote counted. While the official result will only be announced in May, polls from private companies have proven accurate in past elections.
Read: It’s Now or Never for Jokowi to Fix Indonesia After Election Win
“It’s time to brush aside tail risk concerns and buy Indonesian equities,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts Sean Gardiner and Aarti Shah said in a report published Wednesday. There is potential for further interest-rate cuts (Morgan Stanley expects three in the third quarter), a return of private sector confidence and reform, they said.
Opinion polls, which indicated Jokowi was set to win, may have helped allay concerns for investors. Foreign funds, which have been net sellers of Indonesian equities in the past two years, have pumped in $961 million this year, in addition to channeling $3.8 billion into the country’s sovereign bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Stocks
Banks and construction companies may gain more than others as the incumbent is likely to carry on the $350 billion infrastructure building boom that became a highlight of his first term, according to Jeffrosenberg Tan, strategist at PT Sinarmas Sekuritas. Investors, who have been underweight on Indonesia because of uncertainties surrounding the election, will return, he said.
The president has pledged to complete the 2,765-kilometer trans-Sumatra toll road as well as improve internet connectivity in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. His re-election may guarantee policy continuity and ensure continued flow of foreign funds, according to Tan.
“Equities market is expected to gain in the medium term as a landslide win leaves no room for dispute,” Tan said. “Investors, who have been underweight on stocks have to buy back. The flow of foreign direct investment will rise as the victory of the incumbent will ensure political and regulatory stability.”
After a brief surge to 2.4 percent at the trading open, Indonesian stocks pared the rally to 0.8 percent.
“Pent-up buying from foreign long-term value investors and local institutionals to collectively push the index higher,” Taye Shim, head of equities and capital market at PT Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia said. “Any profit taking by the retail investors should be considered a good buying opportunity.”
The iShares MSCI Indonesia exchange-traded fund closed 1.9 percent higher on Wednesday, reaching its highest since Feb. 8.
Rupiah, Bonds
Some expect the rupiah to strengthen further and for more inflows into debt. “Assuming the final result confirms a Jokowi win, I expect to see more capital inflows into local debt and further rupiah strength,” said Tay Ek Pon, senior portfolio manager for emerging-market debt at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.
The potential for interest-rate cuts from the Bank of Indonesia could also boost the allure of local bonds.
“We remain constructive on Indonesia and expect Bank of Indonesia to embark on a rate cutting cycle to reduce the in-build premium to the yield curve from last year’s market volatility,” said Anders Faergemann, a senior money manager at Pinebridge Investments in London.

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",India Should Beware of Saudi Aramco's Billions,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s funny how friendly someone gets when they’re trying to sell you something.
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is doing its best to make nice with one of its biggest customers. With the ink barely dry on the takeover of 70 percent of the country’s chemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. and the issuance of its first-ever corporate bond, Aramco is looking to buy a stake in the world’s biggest oil refinery.
Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. is seeking to sell as much as a quarter of its refining business for at least $10 billion and is entertaining offers from Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News this week.
That represents quite a prize. Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery is about twice the size of the biggest U.S. plant, Aramco-owned Port Arthur, and is so massive that maintenance work occasionally skews India’s entire trade balance.
Trade is also the reason India should be cautious of Aramco’s embrace. The country has a dangerous addiction to imported crude, and it should be wary of getting too cozy with its dealer.
For more than a century, the rise of major economic powers has been fueled by petroleum. The U.S. is both the world’s biggest oil consumer and its biggest producer. The Soviet Union was built on its oilfields in the Caucasus and Siberia. While China has overtaken America as the biggest oil importer, it’s also the biggest producer outside the Middle East after the U.S., Russia and Canada. 
India is different. The U.S. produces about 1.8 metric tons of oil a year per capita and even China manages 138 kilograms. India – at a far earlier stage of development than either country – ekes out just 30 kilograms. Production peaked all the way back in 2010, and shows no sign of recovery. Industrialization is an energy-intensive process. If India’s development is going to be powered by crude oil, it’s going to be buying a whole lot more from Aramco and its ilk.
Such a future would pose some profound risks. Balance of payments crises are a recurring danger for emerging economies, and even at its current stage of development oil typically accounts for about a quarter of India’s imports. If prices spike higher – as, inevitably, they will from time to time – that’s good news for Riyadh, but potentially devastating for New Delhi.
When crude is averaging $85 a barrel – roughly the level at which Saudi Arabia can balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund – oil imports would reduce India’s gross domestic product by about 3.6 percentage points, according to a study this year by the Reserve Bank of India. Higher prices will also push up inflation and weaken the government’s fiscal position, the authors found.
At present, that dynamic is somewhat mitigated by the fact that about a third of India’s oil imports are re-exported as petroleum products, giving the country a natural hedge against rising prices. Jamnagar, for instance, produces almost exclusively for export, meaning that it probably makes a modestly positive contribution to the trade balance since oil products are more valuable than the crude they’re made from.
Should domestic consumption grow faster than export refinery capacity, though, India’s oil dependence will start taking a deeper bite out of its current account. In a worst-case scenario, a spike in oil prices could drive the country toward a balance of payments crisis like the one it suffered in 1991, when a splurge on oil imports over the previous decade resulted in New Delhi pledging its gold reserves as security for bailouts from multilateral lenders.
India is aware that its dependence on imported crude risks constraining growth. The government wants 30 percent of new cars and two-wheelers to be electric by 2030 and is already home to more than 1.5 million electric rickshaws. It’s also adjusted tax policies to encourage that transition. In a country at grave risk from climate change, whose cities are already choking on vehicle smog, reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels is more than just an issue for the current account.
That goal isn’t an unrealistic one given the rock-bottom local cost of wind and solar. Still, no country has managed a low-carbon industrialization on this scale before, so it won’t be easy – and Saudi Arabia will be hoping it proves all but impossible. By promising to buy a chunk of Reliance and help fund a new $44 billion Jamnagar-sized refinery in western India, Aramco is counting on the country being unable to kick its self-destructive oil habit. Indians should hope that it’s wrong.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is making ""steady progress"" on the path to certifying a software update to the grounded 737 MAX and has made the final test flight before a certification flight, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Boeing's newest 737 model, the MAX, was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes, one on Lion Air in Indonesia on Oct. 29 and another on Ethiopian Airlines on March 10, which together killed all 346 on board.
Battling its biggest crisis in years, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer is under pressure to convince global regulators that the aircraft can be safely recertified to fly again.
""We are making steady progress toward certification,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a video on his Twitter account. 
Standing in front of a 737 MAX plane at Boeing Field in Seattle, Muilenburg said the company had completed on Tuesday the official engineering flight test with the updated software with technical and engineering leaders on board the airplane.
""That was the final test flight prior to the certification flight,"" he said.
Boeing is reprogramming 737 MAX software to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that came under scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.
Muilenburg said he had seen first-hand the new software in its final form operating in a range of flight conditions, adding that his team was committed to making the 737 MAX ""one of the safest airplanes ever to fly.""
Boeing must deliver the fix to international regulators for their review, which is expected to last about 90 days.
Deliveries of its fastest-selling aircraft remain frozen and airlines have had to cancel thousands of flights heading into the busy Northern Hemisphere summer travel season.
Boeing has orders for about 4,600 of the fuel-efficient, single-aisle MAX models. 
Of some 50 MAX customers and operators, Muilenburg said more than 85 percent had experienced the new software in simulator sessions and that 120 737 MAX test flights had been held with more than 230 hours of air time with the new software.
In addition to software certification, international regulators must also decide on new pilot training. Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau told Reuters on Wednesday that he thought pilots should receive simulator training rather than computer courses.

Boeing shares, which have lost about 11 percent of their value since the March Ethiopian crash, ended 1.1 percent lower at $377.52 on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - T. Rowe Price funds slashed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc holdings in the first quarter, data showed on Wednesday, as the institutional investor continued to cut its positions in the electric vehicle maker. 
The firm, which has been one of the largest investors in the Silicon Valley company, sold off 92 percent of its prior holdings in the company during the quarter, Refinitiv data showed. 
That drop represented the funds for which Refinitiv has data, which may not include all T. Rowe Price funds, which are managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc.
Neither Tesla nor T. Rowe Price were immediately available to comment after normal business hours. 
The data showed sales between the end of last year and March 31 that ranged from 25 percent of holdings in the T. Rowe Price Global Growth Stock Fund to 100 percent of holdings at the Growth Stock Fund, which had held 2.1 million shares.
In total, six funds cut their Tesla holdings by 100 percent. 
T. Rowe Price's next-largest Tesla holding, within the Blue Chip Growth Fund, with 1.8 million shares, was cut by 82 percent.
Most recently, T. Rowe Price reduced its stake in the fourth-quarter of last year by roughly half, ending December with a 5.2 percent stake in the company overall versus 10.12 percent in September. 
Shares of Tesla fell 16 percent during the first quarter, a difficult period for the company marked by a sharp drop in deliveries of its Model 3, and Chief Executive Elon Musk's public battle in the courts with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 09:15PM ET</span>","Pinterest valued at $12.7 billion in IPO, sign of tech demand after Lyft struggles","By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc's initial public offering set the online scrapbook company's valuation at $12.7 billion on Wednesday, above its expectations and a sign of strength for the tech IPO market after  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's struggles.
Pinterest, where users save ideas for clothes, décor and recipes, is due to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Its performance will be a key test of the tech IPO market after the Nasdaq debut of ride-hailing start-up Lyft at the end of last month. 
Lyft raised more than it had set out to do when it went public, but shares have dropped around 17 percent from its IPO price, raising concerns about bigger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc when it prices its IPO next month.
A key difference between Pinterest and Lyft however were their valuation expectations. Lyft, which lost $911 million last year, was seeking a valuation of up to $24.3 billion in its IPO, higher than the $15 billion valuation it attained in its latest private fundraising round in 2018. Pinterest lost $63 million in 2018. 
Pinterest's initial $15-$17 per share target range target range had set it on course to be valued below its last private fundraising valuation of $12.3 billion in 2017.
At $19 per share, Pinterest, which offers advertisers a venue to sell to consumers, raised around $1.4 billion at a roughly $12.7 billion valuation. 
The fact that Pinterest attained a higher valuation in the IPO will be a relief to investors who participated in prior fundraising rounds and gives some vindication to the company ahead of its public market debut on Thursday. 
Pinterest is also the most high-profile listing of a U.S. social media company since  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2017. Snap's stock also priced well in its IPO but is now down more than 30 percent below its IPO price. 
Other IPOs this year, such as cloud computing company PagerDuty Inc and jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) have also traded above their IPO prices since going public. 
Investors in IPOs typically expect new companies to outperform the broader market. Renaissance Capital's IPO exchange traded fund is up 30 percent so far in 2019, compared with a 15.7 percent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. 
IPOs of Pinterest and other such loss-making unicorns -- startup companies with valuations of at least $1 billion -- have presented a predicament for investors sitting on the fence. They do not want to miss out on popular companies with fast growth, but at the same time have to weigh the risks of businesses with unproven economics.
Pinterest will trade under the symbol ""PINS"". Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Allen & Company are the lead underwriters on the Pinterest IPO.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA hiked diesel prices on Wednesday, and executives said the firm could expand its already aggressive divestment plan while arguing the company was completely free of political interference.
In an impromptu news conference at the Rio de Janeiro headquarters of Petrobras, as the company is known, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco announced a diesel price hike of 10 cents per liter and said Petrobras has complete control over its pricing strategy.
Speaking only minutes before at an event in Sao Paulo, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia said Petrobras was looking at selling off assets such as deepwater pipelines and Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which includes a gas station chain stretching across the country.
The comments come as executives scramble to contain the fallout from the company's cancellation on Friday of a diesel price hike at the behest of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, stirring fears of political interference and tanking Petrobras shares.
While Bolsonaro´s government has promised a hands-off approach to Petrobras, investors are wary of a return to policies enacted under past administrations, in which the company was forced to sell fuel at a discount to international rates.
On Tuesday, Bolsonaro´s spokesman and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes sought to characterize the canceled price hike as a one-time error that would not be repeated.
According to an information posted on Petrobras' website, the company increased the price of diesel at refineries by 4.7 percent after canceling a 5.7 percent increase on Friday.
Castello Branco said Petrobras ""rigorously"" keeps its prices in line with international rates and has no plans to change its policy of adjusting fuel prices every 15 days.
PIPES AND PUMPS
Petrobras is analyzing the best model for selling three offshore natural gas pipelines, Grisolia said, including whether they will be sold individually or in a package.
Grisolia said the company would ""probably"" reduce its stake in Petrobras Distribuidora to below 50 percent from the current 71 percent, effectively privatizing the unit through a secondary share offering. 
Investors have cheered Petrobras' recent push to cut debt and refocus on oil exploration and production via an aggressive divestment program.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Petrobras was preparing to sell three more gas pipelines after successfully selling its larger TAG unit to France's Engie for $8.6 billion. 
Reuters reported on Tuesday the company had hired nine banks to manage Petrobras Distribuidora's share offering.

(Reuters) - Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp is close to a deal to buy U.S.-based pot firm Acreage Holdings, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The deal is expected to fetch a premium of about 28 percent to Acreage's five-day average trading price - or roughly 25 percent of its closing price on Wednesday, the source said.
The transaction could be announced as soon as later on Wednesday, the source said, but cautioned there is no certainty that the two parties will agree to any deal.
The person asked not to be identified because the matter is still confidential.
Cannabis companies in Canada have been pouring cash into their businesses to fend off competition and develop new products, especially after the country approved the use of recreational marijuana in October. They have also been looking for ways to get into the U.S. market, where cannabis remains federally illegal.
Acreage went public on the Canadian Securities Exchange in November and has licenses or agreements with holders in 19 U.S. states, while also managing a chain of retail stores.
A deal would give Canopy the rights to Acreage's products immediately and set up the two companies with an agreement to exchange stock later on the condition that marijuana becomes federally legal in the United States, the source added.
Based on the purchase agreement, Canopy could lend Acreage parts of their branding and intellectual property in order to penetrate the U.S. market while in turn helping Acreage grow, the source said.
Neither Acreage Holdings nor Canopy Growth immediately responded to requests for comment.
U.S.-listed shares of Canopy were up nearly 8 percent at $46.22 in extended trading.

1. Pinterest, Zoom to Debut
A pair of big IPOs hit Wall Street tomorrow.
Image-sharing social media company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) had yet to price its shares at 7:30 PM ET (23:30 GMT). But it’s expected to raise about $1.2 billion.
The company is looking to price 75 million shares between $15 and $17 per share. But according to published reports the IPO is likely to price above the expected range.
Pinterest is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PINS.
Meanwhile,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) raised $751.3 million, more than anticipated, with its IPO.
The video conferencing company priced 20.9 million shares at $36 per share, above its upwardly revised range of $33 to $35 per share.
The company will trade on the Nasdaq as ZM.
2. More Big-Name Earnings Before the Bell
Tomorrow’s earnings report might be a bit more numerous than usual, with markets closed for Good Friday this week.
Among the most important reports before the bell, Honeywell’s first-quarter earnings are expected at $1.83 a share, down 6.2% from $1.95 a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com.
Revenue is forecast at $8.63 billion. That’s off from a year ago, but Honeywell (NYSE:HON) sold off some businesses in the meantime. Its traditional businesses are expected to be strong.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) is expected to earn $1.99 a share in the first quarter. That would be up 7% from a year ago. Analysts also see revenue rising 7.7% from a year ago to $10.5 billion. The shares were flat on Wednesday, but are up 17% on the year.
Oil service giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is seen as an early indicator of the health of the oil-and-gas sector. Earnings are expected at 30 cents a share, down 21% from a year ago. Revenue is estimated at $7.81 billion, down slightly from a year ago’s $7.83 billion.
Shares are up 31% this year, reflecting the big jump in energy prices.
 Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) is forecast to earn $1.90 a share in the first quarter. That would be up 13% from a year ago. Analysts see revenue up 1.1% to $5.54 billion. Union Pacific and other railroads are quickly implementing new operating processes, generally called precision scheduled railroading, designed to move freight more efficiently and reduce operating costs.
Shares are up 23.4% this year. Last year, the shares rose 3.1% after falling 15.1% in the fourth quarter.
3. Retail Sales Expected to Bounce Back
The economic calendar is fairly busy tomorrow, even though it’s just a day before a long weekend for the markets.
The Commerce Department will report the latest figures on retail sales at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that retail sales rose 0.9% in March, with core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, climbing 0.7%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At the same time, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will release its measure of manufacturing activity in its reason.
The April Philly Fed index is forecast to have dipped to 10.4.
And, as usual, the weekly initial jobless claims figures also come out at 8:30 AM ET.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to rise to 205,000 from their lowest level since 1969 reported the week before."
602,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>",UK watchdog orders ringfencing of Big Four audit business,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's ""Big Four"" accounting firms must ringfence auditing from their consultancy work, the country's competition watchdog said on Thursday in a response to book-keeping failures such as at construction company Carillion and retailer BHS.
""Auditors should focus exclusively on producing the most challenging and objective audits, rather than being influenced by their much larger consultancy businesses,"" the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
Exemplifying the issue, regulators found PwC's lead auditor of BHS spent two hours on its 2014 audit and 31 hours on more lucrative non-audit work, leaving the bulk of auditing work to juniors. PwC was fined a record 6.5 million pounds ($9 million) for its shortcomings.
Britain's business minister Greg Clark has said he would introduce legislation to implement the CMA's recommendations, which constitute the most radical reform of auditing yet after previous attempts by Britain and the EU to loosen the Big Four's grip on the market have failed.
Yet operational separation of audit and consultancy at PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG would fall short of the full break-up that British lawmakers called for this month.
The CMA noted ""difficulties with an immediate global structural split"", given the Big Four are international and Britain can only intervene in the UK.
The operational split should be reviewed by regulators after five years to see if tougher measures were needed, the CMA said.
AUDIT QUALITY
The audit practices of the Big Four should have their own management, accounts, pay policies, chief executive and board. Profit-sharing between audit and consultancy should be banned, and promotions and bonuses should be based on the quality of audits, the CMA said.
The Big Four, who audit nearly all of Britain's blue chip companies, say ringfencing would do little to improve competition and standards, and proposed caps on how many companies they could audit to give smaller rivals a leg up.
But the CMA has not included this in its final recommendations.
The CMA confirmed its initial recommendation that the top 350 listed companies must hire two auditors, with one from outside the Big Four - a step some companies are leery about because of the extra cost. Both would be liable for the audit.
Regulators could allow ""initial limited exceptions"" to the joint audit rule for the biggest, most complex listed companies, the CMA said in a nod to a suggestion from lawmakers.
Grant Thornton and BDO, the nearest rivals to the Big Four in Britain, are far smaller and would find it hard to audit a major international company.
The CMA said a company which hired only a non-Big Four auditor would be exempt from the joint audit rule, but all exempt audits should face closer regulatory scrutiny.

Joint audits would remain until regulators decide choice and competition have improved enough to address the sector's vulnerability to a Big Four firm going bust, the CMA said.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 07:01PM ET</span>",Major automakers fear Trump 'grenade' - imposing U.S. auto tariffs,"By Nick Carey and David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major automakers are bullish on the outlook for the U.S. economy and auto sales, but one big question remains - will President Donald Trump throw a grenade into the sector by imposing sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on car and auto parts imports?
The industry is in ""wait-and-see mode,"" but the tariffs would be a bad idea, Bob Carter, head of U.S. sales at Toyota Motor Corp, told Reuters on Wednesday. 
""If the tariff happened on the auto industry, quite frankly that's pulling the pin out of the grenade,"" he said at a conference on Tuesday held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show. ""I don't believe the U.S. economy can run out of the room fast enough if that happens.""
Carter said in an interview he was optimistic the Trump administration would decide against tariffs, yet ""uncomfortable"" given the president's decision last year to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Trump ran for office in 2016 on a protectionist platform aimed at shoring up U.S. manufacturing jobs. He has said in the past he was considering tariffs on autos and auto parts of up to 25 percent.
In February, the U.S. Commerce Department sent recommendations to Trump, which auto industry officials expect to include at least some tariffs on fully assembled vehicles or on critical technologies and components related to electric, automated, connected and shared vehicles. 
Such tariffs would have a deeper impact on car prices and consumers than earlier metals tariffs that were imposed. The steel and aluminum tariffs cost Detroit automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co $1 billion each and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said they could add up to $350 million in costs in 2019. 
HEAVY LOBBYING
Trump is supposed to make a decision by mid-May, but some officials think the administration will find a way to delay final action, using the threat as leverage to try to win concessions on autos in trade talks with Japan and the European Union.
Joe Eberhardt, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover North America, said a 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles would cost the company ""billions."" If the tariffs were on parts, it would also hit U.S. automakers hard, he noted.
""We just hope that reason will prevail,"" he said.
Toyota and other automakers have been lobbying heavily to block any new tariffs on imported vehicles, arguing the industry's global supply chain is so intertwined that tariffs would raise prices, hurt sales and thus damage the economy.
IMPACT ON PRICES
At a conference held ahead of the New York auto show this week, IHS Markit's chief U.S. economist, Joel Prakken, forecast 2019 U.S. new vehicle sales of 16.8 million units, down about 500,000 units from 2018 but still high historically. 
However, tariffs could reduce sales by another 2 million vehicles and shave half to two-thirds of a percentage point off U.S. gross domestic product, he said.
""It would be horrible for the automotive industry, it will be horrible for consumers and it will be horrible for the U.S. economy,"" said Fred Diaz, the U.S. chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. 
In one example, Carter said 72 percent of the parts for the Camry sedan that Toyota makes in Kentucky come from U.S. suppliers, but 28 percent are imported. A 25 percent tariff would cause that car's price to rise $1,800 overnight.
""There is no such thing as a 100 percent U.S. vehicle,"" he told Reuters. 
According to industry estimates, broad tariffs could add an average of $4,000 to a new car's sticker price.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd's North American chairman, Jose Valls, said the automaker has ""invested very heavily in the U.S. and they (the Trump administration) need to take into account our customers and our employees.""
""We'll adjust,"" Valls said. ""But we're not taking decisions on things that haven't been finalized yet.""
Mitsubishi's Diaz said industry groups are lobbying hard against the tariffs.

""The feedback is that we're being heard,"" he said. ""But fundamentally, how do you really know?""

604,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>","Pier 1 Imports fourth-quarter results disappoint, CFO departs","(Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc's Chief Financial Officer Nancy Walsh is leaving after a year in the job at the struggling home furnishing retailer, which reported a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter on Wednesday.
The company known for its wicker chairs and scented candles has been battling falling sales in the face of increasing competition from rivals such as Williams-Sonoma and online giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Walsh is the second top executive to leave the company in the last five months. 
Chief Executive Officer Alasdair James stepped down in December after his turnaround efforts failed to deliver results. The company had then said it was evaluating strategic options, but may not result in a sale.
The company named director of consulting firm AlixPartners Deborah Rieger-Paganis as interim CFO and said it was considering closing up to 45 locations in fiscal 2020 due to lease expirations. 
It has roughly 987 stores in the United States and Canada. Pier 1 said the number of stores likely to be closed could increase by up to 15 percent if Pier 1 fails to achieve performance goals, sales targets, and reductions in occupancy and costs.
Last month, Reuters reported the company has tapped debt restructuring lawyers to navigate potential negotiations with lenders.
Pier 1, which has a market capitalization of about $55 million, had a long-term debt of $245.6 million as of March 2.
The company on Wednesday also unveiled a plan to cut costs and save as much as $110 million in fiscal 2020 ""by resetting its gross margin and cost structure."" 
In the crucial holiday quarter, Pier 1 reported a 13.7 percent decline in same-store sales and missed Wall Street expectation for quarterly revenue as fewer customers visited its stores.
""Our fourth-quarter sales and profitability were disappointing and reflect the execution issues we identified earlier in the year and have been working with urgency to correct,"" Cheryl Bachelder interim CEO said in a statement.

Shares of the company were down 7 percent at 60 cents in extended trading.

The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, which includes Service Employees International Union, American Federation of Teachers, as well as suppliers and contractors to the Puerto Rican government, said the board recently informed the committee it will not pursue claims against advisers, underwriters and public officials involved in debt sales by the island prior to its May 2017 bankruptcy filing.
""The oversight board has alternated between slow-walking a proper investigation into potential causes of action relating to Puerto Rico’s debt issuances, actively obstructing the committee’s own efforts to investigate the debtors’ prior conduct and indebtedness, and simply allowing causes of action to lapse by failing to anticipate and meet statutory deadlines,"" the motion stated. 
The committee asked the judge overseeing the island's bankruptcy to appoint it as a trustee with the power to investigate past debt issuances, as well as pursue fraud, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty claims against individuals.
The board, which is attempting to restructure about $120 billion of the island's debt and pension obligations through a form of bankruptcy, said on Twitter that while it rejected ""actions based on fraud and other speculative theories,"" it has not ruled out suing to recoup fees paid to underwriters and others.
The committee's motion zeroed in on $3.5 billion of general obligation (GO) bonds Puerto Rico issued in March 2014 just months before its government enacted a bankruptcy statute that was subsequently voided in court and a declaration by its then-governor that the island's debt was ""unpayable.""
The oversight board in January asked the court to invalidate the 2014 bonds, as well as GO bonds sold in 2012 for violating a debt limit in the Puerto Rico Constitution. While U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain has yet to rule on that and other motions seeking to void bonds, the statute of limitations for the board to file lawsuits related to the debt runs out next month.
Swain is scheduled to take up the board's request for a deadline extension related to its effort to pursue claims against bondholders at an April 24 hearing.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 05:43PM ET</span>",Declining U.S. market ratchets up competition for SUV sales,"By Nick Carey and David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Falling U.S. new vehicle sales through the rest of 2019 and into 2020 will bring more intense competition in the increasingly crowded market for SUVs and a continued decline in passenger car sales, executives and economists said at this week's auto show in New York.
""There are more and more SUVs coming to market and I continue to see that market growing,"" said Fred Diaz, U.S. chief executive of Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. ""It's hyper competitive.""
The new SUVs at this week's auto show included models from Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Subaru Corp, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai Motor Co.
After a long bull run, U.S. auto sales are expected to fall about 3 percent to 16.8 million units. That is still a respectable number, but the decline will increase competition for market share.
Much of the decrease will be driven by falling sedan sales. As recently as 2012, passenger cars made up more than 50 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales. But that number has dropped rapidly as American consumers have sought the greater comfort and space provided by larger pickup trucks and SUVs. 
While those bigger vehicles are far more profitable for automakers, increased competition could lead to higher incentives in that segment that could squeeze profit margins just like with sedans over the years, industry officials said.
Executives also cited slowly climbing auto interest rates and the rising cost of new vehicles. Honda Senior Vice President Henio Arcangeli said uncertainty about the revised U.S. tax code also had an impact on sales. 
In the first quarter, cars made up just over 30 percent of new vehicle sales.
Bob Carter, head of U.S. sales at Toyota, said the industry-wide passenger car market share could still fall slightly before hitting a bottom. 
But for SUVs, the market has continued to grow and may see slight growth in 2019. That has automakers pushing out new SUVs to fight for sales.
According to data from automotive consultancy LMC Automotive, by the year 2023 there will be 90 mainstream SUV and crossover models on the U.S. market, as well as 90 luxury models. Those numbers compare with 2017 levels of 65 mainstream SUV and crossover models and 53 luxury models.
Patrick Manzi, senior economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), said the growing competition favors those automakers bringing fresh vehicles to the market to grab consumers' attention.
""If you don't have the newest, hottest product, you're going to have to stand out somehow,"" he said. 
One way to stand out with an older vehicle is to offer steeper discounts to potential buyers, Manzi added.
At the show, Ford's luxury Lincoln brand launched a new SUV, the Corsair, which chief marketing officer Joy Falotico said had turned out to be ""lucky timing.""
Lincoln sales rose 11.2 percent in the first quarter, driven by SUV sales even as Ford brand sales fell 2.2 percent.
""I am confident that sales trend will continue,"" Falotico said.
Despite falling sedan sales, executives at Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Toyota said they remain committed to the segment.
Toyota's Carter noted Americans still bought 5.3 million sedans in 2018.
""So maybe it drops another 10 percent, it’s still 4.8 million units and I care desperately about that market,"" he said. ""We're absolutely committed to the truck and SUV market. But we're as equally committed to the car market.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",BlackRock strategists advocate trimming investment portfolio risk,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strategists at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) told their financial adviser clients on Wednesday to look at cutting back on risk and lower expectations for high returns on stocks and bonds.
""We may get another leg-up from earnings but I would say the type of returns we experienced in the first quarter should not be extrapolated,"" BlackRock's chief equity strategist Kate Moore said during its quarterly U.S. wealth advisory event, which was attended over the web by about 1,300 of its financial adviser clients.
""We just want to be conscious of the fact that for both equities and bonds, the types of returns that you've experienced - not just in 2019 but over the course of the last decade and before - are going to be difficult to replicate,"" said Moore.
U.S. stocks have appreciated sharply in recent years, thanks in part to steps the U.S. Federal Reserve took to resuscitate the U.S. economy after the financial crises of 2007-09, but worries abound that investors may be in a late-cycle environment, BlackRock strategists said. 
Indeed, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index has gained about 16 percent in 2019 due to monetary and fiscal stimulus efforts in China and signs the U.S. Federal Reserve will delay further rate hikes for the time being.
In general, the recent market gyrations have not spurred financial advisers into action, Patrick Nolan, a senior strategist with BlackRock's portfolio solutions team, said.
Faced with bouts of volatility, investors can pick from one of three options, Nolan said.
They could treat market gyrations as noise and largely ignore them, Nolan said. Alternatively they could react very strongly and dump risky assets, he said.
The third option is to add more protection in portfolios even as one remains positioned to take part in any gains if markets grind higher, he said.
""It looks to us like adviser models are still taking option one. We actually think option three might be a better path from here,"" said Nolan.
To do this, BlackRock's head of factor investing, Andrew Ang, favors quality - an approach where the focus is on companies that have a track record of stable earnings, are productive and sport a relatively lower level of debt.
""When we take that sort of position we can still participate in the upside for markets but we do that with a more defensive posture,"" said Ang.
On Tuesday, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said the U.S. economy is speeding up again after a slowdown in recent months and cash could soon start rushing into stocks as most investors are underinvested in the markets globally.
BlackRock's Moore agrees. She said a continued dovish tone from the Fed and global central banks, coupled with stabilizing economic growth and an improvement in the outlook for corporate earnings, could still help drive stocks higher. 

""The pain trade is higher,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) switched roles for two women executives on Wednesday, putting Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake in charge of consumer lending and naming card services chief Jenn Piepszak to take Lake's place.
The moves were announced in an internal memo from Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and the bank's two co-presidents.
Both women are 49 and the changes are effective on May 1. Dimon has a practice of moving executives into different positions to broaden their experience in the bank.
The switch will give Lake her first opportunity to run a business at the bank, which addresses a missing qualification in her standing as a likely successor to Dimon. She has won praise from investors and Wall Street analysts for handling the CFO job and Dimon's demands.
Dimon, 63, has said he expects to step down within five years.
Lake's new responsibilities will include card services, home lending and auto finance. She was CFO of consumer banking businesses before becoming CFO of the bank in January 2013. 
Piepszak's star has been rising at JPMorgan as she has moved through different businesses in JPMorgan's consumer & community banking segment under co-president Gordon Smith.
""Jenn has excelled in every role she has taken on in her 25 years with our firm,"" the memo said.

JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and is the most profitable among big banks as measured by return on tangible equity.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC, which sometimes pushes companies to perform better, said it is beginning to look more closely at corporate governance issues, including executive pay, as it evaluates future investments.
""More carefully and systematically studying governance is giving us a new analytical lens and validating our conviction that good governance makes good companies, and vice versa,"" the hedge fund wrote to investors in a quarterly letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The $14.5 billion fund, which has been pushing food company Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) to untangle its corporate structure and streamline its portfolio, is seen as an occasional activist with a record of having earned a 300 percent return on these types of bets in the last eight years.
As delivering top returns becomes tougher for hedge funds, Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, is telling investors that it is good at activism and is using data to become even better.
""We are currently developing methods to systematize our governance practice, including by adding data analytics to our research process,"" the letter said.
Good governance has become a hot-button issue as investors react to companies where management teams are falling behind while sticking to the status quo and their boards that fail to correct the damage.
Third Point said in its letter that some board members ""make decisions to preserve their status and income stream rather than to drive shareholder value.""
Since 2000, Third Point said it has engaged in 45 active or constructive investments and won 24 board seats. It also said that it views every activist investment as ""an opportunity for value creation driven in part by improved governance and advocacy for shareholder rights.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.01%, the S&P 500 lost 0.23%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.05%.
Health care stocks added to losses from a day earlier, led by a fall in UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) as analysts from Citi downgraded their price target on the stock and delivered a bearish assessment on the wider healthcare industry.
Citi lowered its price target for UnitedHealth to $247 from $288, citing concerns over possible government reforms including ""regulatory uncertainties around Medicare for All and concerns around (point-of-sale) rebates.""
UnitedHealth fell 1.9%, and the S&P 500 healthcare sector fell 2.9%.
Mixed earnings, meanwhile, did little to bolster sentiment on stocks.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) fell 4.2% after it beat on earnings but posted a larger-than-expected decline in revenue after the bell yesterday. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell nearly 1.3% as its guidance for the second-quarter fell short of expectations, offsetting better-than-expected first-quarter results.
But there were some bright spots in tech, as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) said it expects incremental earnings per share of $2 in 2020 as product shipments ramp up following the end of its longstanding legal dispute with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The new license between the two companies is six years, with a two-year option to extend, according to Qualcomm. Qualcomm shares jumped 12.25% on the day after soaring 23.2% on Tuesday after the company and Apple announced their settlement.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were roughly unchanged as oil prices slipped modestly despite an unexpected draw in crude stockpiles.
In consumer staples, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) finished up 3.8% and hit a record high of $127.11 after its first-quarter earnings and revenue topped analysts' expectations.
On the trade front, media speculation that the U.S. and China could lock in a final trade meeting, before signing a trade deal, as soon as May or June, had a muted impact on trade-sensitive sectors like industrials and materials.
In other company news, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 3.3% after the chipmaker said it would be exiting the 5G smartphone modem business, citing ""no clear path to profitability and positive returns.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As Qualcomm's major victory against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sent semiconductor stocks to record highs on Wednesday, the sector's strong recent rally may be at odds with uncertainty about an ongoing downturn in global demand.
With the Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumping 1.4% on Wednesday to its second straight record high and now up 35% year to date, upcoming March-quarter reports could become a make-or-break moment for investors.
For a graphic on Chip stocks outperform, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VQxvql 
""People in the industry we speak to seem incredulous at the stock prices but are obviously more than willing to accept the benefit. Very simply, business is not as good as the stocks would imply and we would challenge someone to suggest their business has improved as much as their stock has,"" Semiconductors Advisors wrote in a client note.
Announced on Tuesday, Apple's surprise settlement with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) calls for its iPhones to once again use Qualcomm's modem chips. As a result, Qualcomm's stock has seen its strongest two-day gain since 1999, up 35% and adding $26 billion to the chipmaker's market capitalization.
""The resolution caps a multi-year period in which (Qualcomm's) stock has broadly been viewed as virtually uninvestible, and the resolution will likely go a long way toward assuaging investors who have been terrified of the potential for negative legal and regulatory outcomes,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in report. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) surged 3.6% to a record high after it said hours after the Apple settlement was announced that it would stop making modem chips, an unprofitable business that some investors believe the company is better off without.
Despite Tuesday's seismic shift for the two California semiconductor makers, uncertainly blankets the global industry, with chipmakers yet to reach consensus that a downturn that started last year has touched bottom and little agreement about when and how strongly a recovery will occur.
That uncertainty will increase the focus on Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc when it kicks off March-quarter reports for major U.S. chipmakers on April 23. Analysts on average expect an 8% drop in revenue for Texas Instruments' first quarter and a 5% drop for 2019, although bullish investors argue that industry estimates could rapidly rise as strong signs of a recovery emerge.

Intel reports on April 25, with analysts calling for a 0.3% revenue dip in the first quarter and a 3.7 percent slide in non-GAAP net income to $4.02 billion. Qualcomm reports on May 1.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 03:43PM ET</span>","United sees Boeing's 737 MAX flying this summer, deliveries before year-end","By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines expects Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX jets to return to service this summer, with deliveries resuming before the end of the year, an executive said on Wednesday, reassuring investors concerned about a prolonged suspension.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes, forcing Boeing to freeze deliveries. Boeing is under pressure to upgrade the software and convince global regulators that the plane is safe to fly again, a process expected to take at least 90 days.
Chicago-based United, which is part of United Continental Holdings Inc, removed its 14 MAX aircraft from its flying schedule through early July, while U.S. competitors that own the MAX have planned their flying schedules without the aircraft into August.
United has another 16 MAX orders scheduled for delivery this year.
""The aircraft scheduled for delivery this year, we would expect to take this year,"" Chief Financial Officer Gerald Laderman said on a first-quarter conference call.
United posted a better-than-expected jump in first-quarter profit late on Tuesday after selling more tickets and cutting costs, and stood by its 2019 profit target despite the 737 MAX grounding. Its shares were up 4.0 percent at $88.62 on Wednesday afternoon.
Unlike other U.S. airlines that own the MAX, No. 3 United has largely avoided flight cancellations after the grounding, deferring nonessential maintenance on larger aircraft to put them on MAX routes. 
But executives said on Wednesday that the strategy, manageable for a month or two, gets tougher as time goes on. 
United has been expanding its available seat capacity at a faster pace than rivals but said on Tuesday it was trimming that 2019 target to reflect the grounded MAX as well as suspended flights to Delhi due to closed air space over Pakistan.
Laderman said the carrier's costs per seat mile could grow this year if the MAX aircraft remain out of service or flights to Delhi remain suspended longer than its current assumption.
Looking forward, he said United would discuss with Boeing compensation over costs incurred due to the MAX grounding, noting the temporary grounding of Boeing's 787 soon after it entered service in 2013 as a ""historical reference.""

Of the U.S. MAX owners, United was the first to report first-quarter results. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the largest global MAX operator with 34 jets, reports on April 25, followed by American Airlines Group Inc on April 26.

The Trump administration will allow lawsuits in U.S. courts for the first time against foreign companies that use properties confiscated by Communist-ruled Cuba since Fidel Castro's revolution six decades ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
Toronto-based Sherritt, which is among foreign companies heavily invested in Cuba, said it would continue to operate as usual and would focus on meeting its nickel/cobalt production targets.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened in January to allow a law that has been suspended since its creation in 1996, permitting Cuban-Americans and other U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies doing business in Cuba over property seized decades ago by the Cuban government.
The complete lifting of the ban could allow billions of dollars in legal claims to move forward in U.S. courts and likely antagonize Canada and Europe, whose companies have significant business holdings in Cuba.

""And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs -- all without fundamentally increasing access to care.""
Citi lowered its price target for UnitedHealth to $247 from $288, citing concerns over government reforms including ""regulatory uncertainties around Medicare for All and concerns around (point-of-sale) rebates.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's shift in production at a Michigan plant to trucks from less profitable cars will lead to a more than $1 billion improvement in operating earnings, an official at the No. 2 U.S. automaker said on Wednesday.
The increase in earnings, before interest and taxes, in 2021 compared with 2017 is due to the shift at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, from C-Max hybrids and Focus compact cars to Ranger mid-sized pickup trucks and Bronco SUVs, Ford's Jim Baumbick, vice president of enterprise product line management, said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) conference in New York. 
""The absolute change in profitability is over $1 billion EBIT and we expect over the long, normal cycle, that to continue to improve,"" he said. ""That's just an example of other choices that we're making in the portfolio that are going to unlock additional value.""
Ford has been restructuring its operations globally to improve profitability and speed product development.
Ford is making product shifts elsewhere that are similar to those at the Michigan plant. Baumbick declined to provide details but said there were a couple of cases in which Ford was making ""major changes in the overall profit contribution"" from one vehicle to another. 
The Ranger went on sale in January and the Bronco will launch next year. 
In 2017, Ford built about 200,000 C-Max and Focus vehicles and will assemble more than 200,000 of the Ranger and Bronco vehicles in 2021, when the latter is at full production, Baumbick said. 
Ford invested $850 million in the Detroit-area plant to retool for the pickup and SUV.
Baumbick said Ford will not chase volume over profitability with any launches. ""If the better business has a slightly lower volume, then so be it,"" he said.
As part of Ford's push to speed up product development, Baumbick said a team of employees in 12 weeks developed a vehicle for the ""affordable segments"" that will go into production before the end of 2022. He declined to provide more detail.
Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, gets 150 percent of its operating profit from its strongest products, such as F-150 full-size pickup trucks and Transit vans. The focus is on shifting investments to areas that offer operating profit margins in the high teens on a percentage basis, Baumbick said. 

He also said a Ford Mustang-inspired battery electric SUV that Ford plans to introduce next year would be profitable from its launch and build on company strengths, just like the upcoming electric F-150 will do.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>","EU states force clearing of Estonian, Danish regulators over Danske Bank","By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Francesco Guarascio
COPENHAGEN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - National banking supervisors who control the European Union banking watchdog effectively forced it to clear financial regulators in Estonia and Denmark, who were investigated in relation to suspected money laundering activities by Danske Bank, a member of the European parliament said on Wednesday.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) said in a statement on Wednesday it was closing its investigation.
""At a vote at its meeting on 16 April 2019 the EBA's Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal for a breach of Union law recommendation,"" it added.
The rejection blocked any further legal action by the EBA against the Estonian and Danish supervisors and signaled EU states' reluctance to let the bloc's authorities investigate the exposure of their banking systems to financial crime.
Danish and Estonian financial regulators have publicly blamed each other for the Danske Bank money laundering scandal, after Denmark's largest bank last year admitted that 200 billion euros ($226 billion) of suspicious transactions flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The EBA in February opened a formal investigation into a possible breach of EU law by the two regulators over the Danske case, which is considered by many Europe's largest money-laundering scandal.
All 28 national supervisors but one who sit on the watchdog's board rejected the EBA's recommendation, German MEP Sven Giegold told Reuters after talking to a person familiar with how the decision was taken.
The EBA declined to elaborate on the decision of the board.
The Danish and Estonian financial regulators were not immediately available for comment.
Giegold, who sits in the EU parliament's committee on financial crime, called the decision ""scandalous"" and urged the EU Commission to continue the inquiry into a possible breach of EU laws by the Danish and Estonian authorities.
""We cannot accept the biggest money laundering scandal in Europe not being properly investigated,"" he said.
EU states have halted a reform of the powers of EU financial supervisors which was intended to make it more difficult for states to block EU probes into a national supervisor. A watered-down overhaul was definitively adopted on Tuesday.
BALTIC WOES
Earlier on Wednesday the Director General of the Danish FSA Jesper Berg said he was satisfied with the closure of the EBA investigation. He said he was strengthening efforts to curb money laundering and financial crime.
The Estonian FSA also said it would continue its fight against money laundering.
The Danske scandal has reinforced calls by EU lawmakers for stronger European oversight of the union's banking sector and tighter scrutiny of the often close relationships between regulators and the banks they oversee.
""Even if no laws were formally breached, this still leaves unanswered whether regulators lived up to their responsibility and reacted to any suspicions,"" said Jeppe Kofod, a Dane who heads the European Parliament's Special Committee on Tax Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance.
Danish lawmakers have increased penalties for money laundering eight-fold, and the government says it plans to create a ""more aggressive financial regulator"".
Adding to the pressure on European lawmakers is an investigation into Swedish lender Swedbank by Swedish and Baltic financial watchdogs after broadcaster SVT reported it processed gross transactions worth up to 20 billion euros ($22.6 billion) a year from high-risk, non-resident clients, mostly Russians, through its Estonian branch between 2010 and 2016.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 01:04PM ET</span>",Aeva signs sensor deal with Audi's self-driving unit,"By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Aeva Inc, a startup company founded by former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, has signed a sensor-system deal with an Audi-owned unit that is working on self-driving technology for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG.
Aeva said on Wednesday that Audi's AID-Autonomous Intelligent Driving unit, a “center of excellence” for Volkswagen autonomous driving efforts, will be using its lidar sensor on its so-called ""e-tron"" development fleet vehicles in Munich, Germany. 
The lidar units help give cars a three-dimensional view of the road. Audi's AID said it will use the sensors to help develop its so-called robo-taxis, which aim to autonomously ferry passengers around urban areas in the next few years.
Aeva last year raised $45 million in venture funding led by Lux Capital and Canaan.
Alexandre Haag, AID's chief technology officer, told Reuters in an interview that his unit was drawn to Aeva's technology because it can generate a 3-D map of the environment around a vehicle, as well as measure the velocity of objects around the car in real time.
That could help the sensor spot things like a pedestrian darting out between two cars, Haag said.
""If anything moves, it's something that you need to pay attention to,"" he said.
Aeva's sensor can measure the velocity of objects because it differs from most lidar units now being tested on the road.
Many lidar units send powerful laser bursts and measure their intensity after they bounce off the road and come back to the sensor. Aeva's unit instead sends out a lower-powered continuous wave and measures its frequency when it returns. Montana-based startup Blackmore is working on similar continuous wave technology.
Rezk said the lower power requirements mean Aeva can make its sensors in the same factories as traditional semiconductors, which will help lower the cost of the units in the future. Current lidar units from others can cost as much as $100,000, a figure automakers are hoping to reduce.
""We can integrate a lot of these optical components on the silicon level,"" Rezk told Reuters. ""It is designed for mass scale.""
Aeva and AID would not disclose the financial terms of the deal or how much the sensors currently cost, but Haag said the automaker believes ""there's a path to the right cost for us,"" with Aeva's sensor.

""Cost is very dependent on volume,"" he said. ""So it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, but that's where we can be the chicken, in the sense that we have the potential to scale.""

632,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks under pressure to make deeper cost cuts,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. banks must make deeper cost cuts to drive earnings growth, with revenue expected to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
Cost cutting was already a major driver of bank earnings for the first quarter. With the exception of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), revenue fell at the biggest U.S. lenders as lower market volatility weighed on trading and recession fears dulled clients' appetite for borrowing.
But Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) still managed to beat analyst profit forecasts even as revenue slipped.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, stood out from rivals by growing both revenue and profit.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which is operating under growth restrictions imposed by regulators, missed profit forecasts.
Some of the banks warned that growth in their net interest income, the difference between what they earn on loans and pay on deposits, will slow in 2019 thanks to a flatter yield curve and a moderating economy. The Federal Reserve in March signaled that it unlikely to raise interest rates this year.
With that major revenue source under pressure and the outlook on other business areas uncertain, expense controls may be the only reliable way for banks to boost profit, analysts said.
""There's a very close watch on expenses right now and that will probably continue until there's better visibility on revenue growth,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.
Shanahan said the potential for credit quality to deteriorate as the United States nears the end of the credit cycle also adds to the pressure for banks to get expenses in line.
""Credit can only really get worse from here,"" he said. ""That is going to be a headwind at some point and all the more reason for the banks to be trying to control their expenses.""
Banks were caught out by the Fed's change of tack on rates and will need time to adjust their business models in response to the challenging revenue outlook, said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management.
""That's going to be hard for them and you won't see them adapting for two or three quarters. It's a major headwind,"" he said. 
Banks are also juggling the need to support short-term earnings with making investments in the longer-term growth of their businesses.
JPMorgan was the only big U.S. bank that increased expenses as it spent more on technology, hiring bankers and marketing. 
""JPMorgan is electing to invest in the business,"" said Shanahan. ""Its strategy is about leveraging the investments it's already made in digital initiatives.""
Analysts and bankers said that any uptick in revenue across the sector is likely to come from banks' trading operations. Equities revenues in particular fell sharply during the first quarter, but could improve if a return of market volatility spurs client activity.
""Going forward it's going to be a function of markets,"" Morgan Stanley's Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview on Wednesday. ""Confidence is reasonably good and stock markets are reasonably stable.""
Another potential source of revenue growth would be an upturn in initial public offerings. Equity underwriting was dampened in the first quarter because of a U.S. government shutdown that held up regulatory approvals, but is expected to pick up as the backlog clears.
""Already in the second quarter we've seen a major recovery in U.S. IPO volumes,"" JPMorgan's Chief Financial Officer told analysts on a conference call on Friday.
Most analysts are forecasting banks will achieve earnings growth of 7 percent to 9 percent over the full year, and expect cost cutting to be a major driver since they only see revenue growth of 1 percent to 3 percent. 
Banks are also expected to keep buying back shares, which boosts earnings per share.
""The return of capital is a critical driver but one you don't hear people talking about much,"" said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at Vining Sparks. 
Mosby thinks concerns about sluggish revenue growth are overblown.
""There's a disconnect between valuations and the steady-as-you-go earnings progression we're seeing,"" he said.

""It's not going to be a question of pulling out an iPad and spending an hour on it,"" said Marc Garneau. ""Simulators are the very best way, from a training point of view, to go over what could happen in a real way and to react properly to it."" 
His comments came after a draft report from a board appointed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said additional training was needed, but a simulator would not be required.
Garneau told Reuters a software fix and new training are needed before the plane can fly again in Canada, and the training must include time in a simulator, so pilots can rehearse the circumstances of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October.

In that crash as well as the Ethiopian Airlines disaster on March 10, pilots lost control of the planes soon after taking off. Investigators are focused in part on an anti-stall system called the MCAS, or maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, which can repeatedly push the plane's nose down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is lifting a long-standing ban against U.S. citizens filing lawsuits against foreign companies that use properties seized by Cuba’s Communist government since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.
The major policy shift, which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billion of dollars, is intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding an end to Cuban support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.
But President Donald Trump's decision, which was quickly denounced by Cuba as ""an attack on international law,"" could also further strain economic relations with U.S. allies in Europe and Canada, whose companies have significant interests on the island.
""Any person or company doing business in Cuba should heed this announcement,"" Pompeo said at a news conference.
""Cuba’s behavior in the Western Hemisphere undermines the security and stability of countries throughout the region, which directly threatens United States national security interests,"" he said.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, will discuss the administration's decision in a speech on Wednesday in Miami, where he will also announce new sanctions on Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, countries he has branded a ""troika of tyranny,"" a senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Trump decided to allow a law that has been suspended since its creation in 1996 to be fully activated, permitting Cuban-Americans and other U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies doing business in Cuba over property seized in decades past by the Cuban government.
Title III of the Helms-Burton Act had been fully waived by every president over the past 23 years due to opposition from the international community and fears it could create chaos in the U.S. court system with a flood of lawsuits.
“I strongly reject the announcement of State Secretary Pompeo,"" Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a message on Twitter. ""This is an attack on international law and the sovereignty of Cuba and third states. Aggressive escalation of #USA against #Cuba will fail.""
The move, which could deal a blow to the Cuban government's efforts to attract foreign investment, marks a further step by Trump to roll back parts of the historic opening to Cuba, an old Cold War foe, under his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Pompeo said the Obama administration had played ""a game of footsie with the Castros' junta"" and accused the Cuban government of widespread human rights abuses. ""Detente with the regime has failed,"" he told reporters.
PUSHBACK FROM EU, CANADA
Among the foreign companies heavily invested in Cuba are Canadian mining firm Sherritt International Corp and Spain’s Melia Hotels International SA. U.S. companies, including airlines and cruise companies, have forged business deals in Cuba since the easing of restrictions under Obama.
It was unclear, however, how such property claims, some of which involve complex legal matters, will fare in U.S. courts.
""The EU will consider all options at its disposal to protect its legitimate interests, including in relation to its WTO rights and through the use of the EU Blocking Statute,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a joint statement.
A joint EU-Canada statement said the U.S. move was ""regrettable"" and will have an ""important impact on legitimate EU and Canadian economic operators in Cuba.""Kim Breier, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said the administration had been in close contact with allies in Europe and elsewhere before the Cuba decision and that a ""vast number"" of European firms operating there would not have any problems.
She said, however, that a U.S. government commission has certified nearly 6,000 claims for property confiscated in Cuba with a current value, including interest, of about $8 billion.
""There could be up to 200,000 uncertified claims ... and that value could very easily be in the tens of billions of dollars,"" Breier added. ""It will depend on whether claimants decide to pursue legal cases or not.”
U.S. officials left no doubt that the Helms-Burton decision, which takes effect on May 2, is part of the Trump administration's effort to force Cuba to abandon Maduro, something Havana has insisted it will not do.
Washington says Havana's security and intelligence support is critical to Maduro's grip on power amid Venezuela's economic and political crisis.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked the constitution in January to assume the interim presidency.
The United States and most Western countries have backed Guaido as head of state. Maduro, backed by Cuba, Russia, China and the Venezuela military, has denounced Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup.

Trump’s toughened stance on Cuba as well as Venezuela has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a political swing state as he looks toward his re-election campaign in 2020.

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc added $30 billion to its market value after it resolved a legal battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a move that secures its leadership in 5G phone chips and could pave the way for a similar settlement with China's Huawei Technologies.
The company's shares, which closed up 23 percent on Tuesday after the announcement, rose as much as 17 percent on Wednesday, hitting their highest in nearly two decades.
The deal with Apple, coming at the cusp of the rollout of high-speed 5G network, could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.
Qualcomm's fortunes are also looking up since  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), which had been Apple's sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year, decided to exit the modem chip business following Qualcomm's settlement with Apple.
""In the US, around 5G it's Qualcomm's world and everyone else is just paying rent,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.
""This was a game changing settlement for Qualcomm and was also a smart move by Apple to clear this noise and focus on 5G smartphones for 2020.""
Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their recommendations and price targets on Qualcomm's stock following the settlement.
At least three brokerages raised their ratings and nine ratcheted up their price targets. Stifel made the most aggressive move by raising its target by $43 to $100 - well above the median price target of $75.85.
Of the 25 brokerages covering the stock, 14 rate it ""buy"" or higher and the rest have a ""hold"" rating, according to Refinitiv data.
Bond investors also joined in, with Qualcomm's 4.3 percent 2047 issuance becoming one of the most heavily traded bonds in the U.S. corporate space on Wednesday, according to capital markets publication IFR.
The company could make $2 billion annually by taking Intel's market share and regain the dominant position it enjoyed during the rollout of 4G, analysts said.
The settlement also helps Apple close the gap with rivals such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co and Huawei in delivering a 5G phone.
Both Apple and Huawei had been at odds with Qualcomm over patents and royalties over modems. While Qualcomm did not close the terms of the deal, analysts estimated that Apple withheld $5 billion, or about $2 per share, under its previous royalty payment agreement.
""We now expect an imminent settlement with Huawei which has also been withholding royalty payments, which we estimate will add another $0.50-$0.75 of EPS,"" Cowen and Company analysts said.

A settlement with Apple and Huawei will not only bring in more royalty payments and reduce legal costs, it will help Qualcomm to focus more in rolling out its 5G modems, several analysts said.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were trading flat on Wednesday, as a Qualcomm-led rally in chipmakers was offset by a slide in healthcare stocks for the second straight session, although quarterly earnings came in largely positive.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc surged 10.3% after the company won a major victory in its legal dispute with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips.
Data showed China's economy grew at a steady 6.4% pace in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown. This helped chipmakers, which get a huge portion of their revenue from China, rally. The Philadelphia chip index jumped 1.45%.
The S&P healthcare index tumbled 2% and was on pace to wipe out its yearly gains due to ongoing concerns about potential changes to healthcare policy.
""Investors are kind of taking a step back. Q1 earnings have been fine, but there is still a decent amount of debate in the market around where do we go this year in terms of economic growth,"" said Mike Dowdall, a portfolio manager with BMO Global Asset Management.
""We are going to have to see earnings expectations continue to increase and an even more positive outcome from trade.""
Of the 54 S&P 500 companies that have posted results so far, about 80% have beaten estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
However, analysts now expect first-quarter S&P 500 profits to drop 1.8% year-on-year. Though a solid improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first earnings contraction since 2016.
United Continental Holdings Inc rose 4.2% after reporting a better-than-expected jump in quarterly profit and fueled a 1.1% rise in the Dow Jones transport index. 
At 11:08 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.04 points, or 0.03%, at 26,459.70.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>","Back on trend? H&M makes AI, loyalty drive to ride fashion cycle","By Emma Thomasson and Anna Ringstrom
BERLIN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - When H&M boosted its shares last month by reporting a rise in the sale of full-price garments, it wasn't just a tribute to the fashion sense of its designers. It was a sign that backroom improvements are at last paying off.
The world’s second-largest fashion group is investing heavily in areas like artificial intelligence and customer loyalty as it looks to improve the way it spots trends and plans logistics, and ultimately reduce discounted sales and piles of unsold stock.
Arti Zeighami, H&M’s head of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence, told Reuters the strategy is starting to bear fruit as the company extends pilot projects that seek to use data to match supply and demand more closely.
""Allocating the right goods to the right stores in the right markets is one of the key projects we are working on,"" Zeighami said. ""For 2019 we have huge plans for growing that and hopefully, by the end of next year, covering globally.""
In the age of social media, fashion companies have less power to drive trends, which come and go much more quickly as influencers promote their ""outfit of the day"" on Instagram.
That poses a particular problem for H&M, which produces most of its garments in Asia, far from its major markets, making it less responsive than its rival Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) which boasts it can get new designs to its stores within a week.
Sportswear brand Adidas (DE:ADSGN) admitted last month it had been caught flat-footed when its suppliers failed to keep up with strong U.S. demand for its mid-priced clothing ranges.
H&M had seen stocks of unsold goods pile up over the past three years.
IMPROVEMENTS IN BUYING
In the quarter through February, inventories grew to 40 billion crowns ($4.3 bln), or 18.6 percent of sales, but H&M said they consisted of a higher share of clothes that are newer, thus less likely to be sold at marked-down prices. 
It has said this is a sign its overhaul is working, and it expects a better offering and improvements in buying and logistics to help it reduce inventories to between 12 and 14 percent of sales by the end of 2022.
""Companies like ours once dictated fashion in a certain way. Today fashion is growing organically: you have influencers, you have communities,"" Zeighami said. ""It is hard sometimes to quantify. Is it orange or pineapple, tassel earrings or choker?""
Danske Bank analyst Daniel Schmidt said a small increase in gross margin and management promises of smaller markdowns for a third straight quarter suggests H&M's profits have finally hit bottom.
""Even though stocks are high, their quality is probably better than we can see,” Schmidt said.
H&M Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson said last month investment in AI was already helping predict trends and allocate garments to stores: ""Over time, this will mean a lot of improvements."" 
Companies in a range of industries are touting AI as the answer to their most pressing business problems, but many experts caution it may not live up to the hype. 
Zeighami said he prefers to call it ""amplified intelligence"" because he wants to mine data to help humans make better decisions.
He cited the example of a maths model which showed mass market demand peaks when an influencer trend is going down. One designer he showed it to said having such data would have helped her stand up to buyers who jumped on a trend too late.
CUSTOMER LOYALTY
""She had the gut feeling, so us amplifying that would help her to take the right decision and overrule the buyers,"" he said.
At rival Zara, merchandising teams use data gleaned from stores, webpages and app to adapt their designs, in addition to insights from social media, returns and reviews, with the entire stock gradually refreshed every four to five weeks.
Unlike Zara, H&M also has a fast-growing customer loyalty scheme from which it is harvesting information, in addition to analyzing data from social media.
The club, which doubled membership to 30 million in 2018, is in 16 of the H&M brand’s 71 markets and will add seven more including the United States by the end of the year.
Samuel Holst, head of the H&M Club, said another eight markets would be added in 2020 and he expected to keep up the membership growth rate.
Holst hopes new functions such as members gaining bonus points for reviewing garments and, later this year, for sustainable actions such as recycling clothes, will help H&M understand shoppers.
""Knowing our customers - having this insight, knowing where, how and when they shop, knowing what they like - that is an important piece in how we will be able to predict trends,"" Holst told Reuters. 

""The better we know the customer the better we can do this,"" Holst said. ""That is the foundation for being able to have very good inventories with a healthy rotation of the garments.""

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Embattled Jet Airways said on Wednesday it was halting all flight operations after its lenders rejected its plea for emergency funds, potentially bringing the curtains down on what was once India's largest private airline. 
The carrier, saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of bank debt, has been teetering for weeks after failing to receive a stop-gap loan of about $217 million from its lenders, as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March. 
""The airline has been left with no other choice today but to go ahead with a temporary suspension of flight operations,"" the company said in a two-page statement late on Wednesday. 
At its peak, Jet operated over 120 planes and well over 600 daily flights. The airline, which has roughly 16,000 employees, has in recent weeks been forced to cancel hundreds of flights and to halt all flights to overseas destinations, as funds have dried up.
Intense competition from low-cost carriers, like Interglobe-owned IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd, together with higher oil prices, hefty fuel taxes and a weak rupee have piled pressure on the airline in recent months. 
In its statement on Wednesday, the airline thanked its loyal customers for their patronage and support over 25 years and said it ""sincerely and profusely apologizes for the disruption to the travel plans of all its guests.""
The airline said it would continue to work with its lenders, who are trying to identify an investor willing to buy a majority stake in the airline and attempt to turn it around. 
Jet Airways said it would continue to support the bid process initiated by the banks and that it hopes to resume flying soon. 
Its lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), have been seeking expressions of interest for an up to 75 percent stake in the airline. Initial expressions bids were submitted last week.
Jet Airways, in its statement, said it had been informed 
late on Tuesday night by its lenders that they were unable to consider its request for critical interim funding.
""Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations
going,"" the airline said. 
Two sources at state-run banks told Reuters that the banks had rejected a request for 4 billion rupees ($58 million) from Jet to keep itself temporarily afloat.
""Bankers did not want to go for a piecemeal approach which would keep the carrier flying for a few days and then again risk having Jet come back for more interim funding,"" said one of the bank sources directly involved in Jet's debt resolution process.
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. 
SBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The crisis at Jet, which owes vast sums to suppliers, pilots lessors and oil companies, has deepened in recent weeks as its lessors have scrambled to de-register and take back planes, in a sign the bank rescue plan had failed to assuage their concerns.
India's aviation regulator said on its website on Wednesday that lessors had applied to de-register another four Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 planes. 
An analysis of the latest data disclosed by India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that Jet's lessors have, so far, sought to deregister and repossess at least 48 planes operated by Jet. Once deregistered, lessors are free to reclaim a plane and lease it to another airline.
The rapid exodus of planes risks further eroding value from the carrier, even as lenders scurry to find an investor willing to buy a majority stake in the airline.

Italian banks used a voluntary-contribution scheme set up under the depositor fund to come to Carige's rescue in November. The scheme bought a 320 million euro hybrid bond needed to boost the bank's total capital ratio. A conversion into equity of the bond would now support BlackRock's rescue plan for Carige.

A conversion is now ""very likely"" but no decision has been taken yet, the depositor guarantee fund's President Salvatore Maccarone told reporters after a meeting over the issue, adding talks with BlackRock were ongoing.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 10:51AM ET</span>",Companies warn Trump: Census citizenship question could be costly,"By Lauren Tara LaCapra
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An array of U.S. companies have told the Trump administration that a citizenship question on the 2020 Census would harm business if it leads to an undercount of immigrants, undermining the data they use to place stores, plan inventory and plot ad campaigns.
Corporate executives, lobbyists and representatives from major industry groups like the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the International Council of Shopping Centers have raised the issue in meetings with government officials, according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the matter. Some meetings date back to 2017, when the administration was first mulling adding the question.
Industry officials continue to seek assurances from the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department that the question's impact on the quality of Census data will be minimized, according to the sources, who described the meetings on condition of anonymity.
The pressure reflects the economic importance of the decennial count of America's inhabitants.
The Census is used to draw voting districts and divide some $800 billion in federal programs. For companies, it provides the most detailed picture available of consumer and labor markets. Under the administration's proposal, the Census would ask whether respondents are citizens of the United States for the first time in 70 years.
Corporate America finds itself in an unlikely alliance with immigrant advocacy groups that have sued to block the question on the basis it could scare immigrants out of participating, and therefore cost their communities funds and political representation. The Supreme Court plans to hear arguments on the case next week.
Clothes-maker Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI), transport companies Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and media group Univision Communications Inc are among a handful of companies supporting that lawsuit. In court documents, they said the citizenship question ""threatens to undermine (the) reliability of Census data and therefore substantially reduce its value to businesses.""
Few other companies or trade groups, however, have been willing to discuss their opposition to the citizenship question publicly. In interviews, sources said they are only voicing opinions in private meetings, out of concern about a White House backlash.
Spokespeople for several major trade groups along with big name companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and many others either declined to offer a statement for this story or did not respond to requests for comment.
""While corporations and business groups are reluctant to enter the political turmoil surrounding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census, they nonetheless depend heavily on accurate Census data for their operations,"" said DeVere Kutscher, executive director of the Census Business Coalition, one of the main groups advocating on behalf of industry.
""As a result, they are focusing their efforts on what they can do to support a complete, secure, and accurate count, and are understandably concerned about the impact of any factor which could jeopardize that,"" he added. 
Underscoring the political stakes, earlier this month President Donald Trump ripped ""radical"" Democrats opposed to the citizenship question on Twitter, saying a Census without such a question would be ""meaningless.""
The Census Bureau has taken pains to ensure everyone is counted, Burton Reist, a longtime Census official who oversees decennial communications and stakeholder relations, said in an interview. In response to questions about the business community's view on the citizenship question, a spokesman pointed Reuters to the Census Bureau's official responses to stakeholders.
The Commerce Department, which houses the Census Bureau, provided a statement detailing the planned communications and outreach spending that will encourage people to respond. The budget is $500 million, up from the $376 million spent in 2010.
""The Census Bureau has long been planning the most robust marketing and outreach effort in Census history for the 2020 Census,"" a spokesman said in a statement.
Documents released through litigation confirm that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with dozens of interested parties, including business groups, to get their views before announcing his decision to add the citizenship question last year.
While many expressed concerns that the question would hurt response rates, Ross was not convinced, according to a March 2018 memo he wrote explaining his decision. He said data from the question would help the Department of Justice enforce provisions of the Voting Rights Act.
AN ""MRI"" FOR BUSINESS
The stakes are high in getting an accurate count.
Retailers like Walmart and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) use Census data to decide where to open stores or distribution hubs, and what to stock on shelves.
Big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) use the information similarly for branch strategy, and real-estate firms scrutinize the statistics to determine where to build homes and shopping centers.
TV networks like Univision, meanwhile, rely on the numbers to plan programing in local markets. And the Census is an important input for tech giants like Google when they create myriad data-based products, such as maps.
""You get households, number of people, number of bedrooms, income, gender, age, race, marital status — it's almost like an MRI,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. ""And it all goes into assessing where and how to provide goods and services.""
Underscoring how the survey can drive major business decisions, Amazon's 20-city search for a new headquarters location also had Census data at its core.
Having failed to convince the administration to drop the question, companies are now focused on programs to encourage people to participate in the Census to bolster data quality, sources said.
Efforts could include company-wide email messages to employees, prominently displaying a link to the Census on corporate web sites or setting up physical stations where customers can fill out the survey inside of stores or malls, the sources said.
Ahead of the 2010 Census, McDonald's Corp featured information on restaurant placemats, Walmart greeters handed out flyers, big retailers featured reminders on receipts and utility companies stuck inserts into electric, gas and water bills.
Such programs have been helpful in the past, said John Thompson, who spent nearly 30 years at the Census Bureau before leaving as director in 2017. But whether they can overcome the negative impact of the citizenship question is an open question.

""They've got a tougher row to hoe,"" he said.

Under a new management team Denel, a cornerstone of South Africa's once mighty defense industry, is battling to emerge from a financial and operational crisis.
It said last month it could wind down production for the A400M as part of a turnaround plan but did not mention the estimated timeframe or financial impact.
But in a presentation dated March 29 and seen by Reuters Denel said a ""managed exit with Airbus"" could bring it an annualized benefit of 250 million rand ($17.9 million). 
Denel, which made a 1.7 billion rand loss in the 2017/18 financial year, said in its annual report for that year that the Airbus contract was historically loss-making and that liquidity challenges had hampered its ability to deliver parts on time.
A Denel spokeswoman said terms were not yet finalised with Airbus about stopping production for the A400M.
A spokesman for Airbus said: ""The agreement to withdraw the A400M work packages is a mutual one. Airbus and Denel are discussing how best to proceed.""
The presentation also said Denel wanted to reduce its staff numbers by around 400 employees. 
As of this week around 200 Denel staff had agreed voluntary severance packages (VSP), two trade union sources told Reuters, adding that further severance packages were being discussed.
""With regards to the VSP process, it's important to note this is done in such a way that we retain critical and scarce skills,"" the Denel spokeswoman said. 
""A reduction in our headcount cannot be avoided if long-term growth and profitability is to be achieved.""

649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Paris region opens bus system to competition,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - The Paris region opened its bus system to competition on Wednesday, kicking off the liberalization of one of Europe's biggest public transport systems.
The board of regional public transport authority Ile-de-France Mobilites (IDFM) approved a new system for private operation of parts of its bus system and selected the first routes to be opened for a series of tenders that will be worth more than 12 billion euros ($13.6 billion). 
The Ile-de-France region - which accounts for about 30 percent of French GDP - will open all bus lines in the ""Grande Couronne"" of outer suburbs to competition by 2021. The ""Petite Couronne"" of Paris itself and inner suburbs will follow by 2025. 
On Wednesday, IDFM's board chose the first six of 40 outer suburban bus route areas that will be opened for tender in July. The tenders will be awarded in spring 2020 and new operators will start in January 2021. Six more lines will be opened to tender in the second half of this year, and the rest in 2020 for combined annual revenue of about 900 million euros. 
Revenue of the Ile-de-France bus operators is about 2.5 billion euros per year, and with operator contracts being tendered for 5-7 years, these could be worth at least 12.5 billion euros, IDFM director Laurent Probst told Reuters. 
For now, most of the Ile-de-France bus network is operated by state-owned or semi-state-owned public transport operators, whose contracts are renewed in one-to-one negotiations. 
Transdev, majority-owned by state bank Caisse des Depots, has a 50 percent market share; Keolis, majority-owned by state railways SNCF has 20 percent; while state-owned public transport firm RATP has 10 percent. 
A series of private operators including Lacroix, STIVO, TICE, Albatrans, Savac and Procars have a combined market share of 20 percent. There are no foreign operators, although Transdev is 34 percent owned by Germany's Rethmann, Canadian pension fund CDPQ has a 30 percent stake in Keolis and some of the private operators also have foreign shareholders.
""There is space for new players, and we hope that foreign operators will take part in the tenders,"" Probst told Reuters.
No foreign players have expressed an interest in the tenders so far. Industry specialists say that Britain's FirstGroup and Abellio, Deutsche Bahn-owned Arriva, Spain's Vectalia and Moventia, and Swiss PostBus could be contenders.
Transdev, Keolis and RATP themselves are also major players in public transport systems abroad. 
Probst said introducing competition is not an aim in itself but a means to improve service and reduce costs. 
IDFM on Wednesday also approved plans for a tender for more than 600 new clean buses, which will be owned by IDFM, not by the new operators. Their existing buses will be bought by IDFM at the end of their contracts. 
France is well behind Britain and Germany in terms of opening public transport to competition. French President Emmanuel Macron privatized long-distance buses when he was economy minister under his predecessor Francois Hollande. 
But while rail liberalization is obligatory under European Union rules, Macron's reform of the SNCF last year was aimed at ending the job-for-life contracts of its workers, but not at privatizing French rail.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>","Bridgewater warns of peak U.S. profit margins, lower stock prices","By Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - The major drivers of high U.S. corporate profit margins are unsustainable and ""now under threat"", which will eventually result in much lower equity prices, Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, said on Wednesday in a report. 
""Over the last two decades, U.S. corporate profit margins have surged and have contributed more than half of the excess return of equities relative to cash,"" said Bridgewater, which oversees more than $160 billion in assets. 
""Without that consistent expansion of margins, U.S. equities would be 40% lower than they are today.""
Over the last few decades, almost every major driver of profit margins has improved, Bridgewater said.
""Labor’s bargaining power fell, corporate taxes fell, tariffs fell, globalization increased, technology allowed for greater scale and lower marginal costs, anti-trust enforcement fell, and interest rates fell. These factors have produced the most pro corporate environment in history. Many of these drivers of high profit margins are now under threat.""
""Some of the forces that supported margins over the last 20 years are unlikely to provide a continued boost,"" Bridgewater said. ""Incentives for offshore production have been reduced as global labor costs have moved closer to equilibrium, with domestic costs and rising trade conflict increasing the risk of offshoring, while the potential tax rate arbitrage from moving abroad is now much smaller.""
At the same time, popular sentiment has begun to turn against the forces driving corporate profits, as well as against the companies that have benefited most, Bridgewater said.
""We are in the midst of a populist backlash against rising inequality and increasingly seeing a move toward more protectionism,"" it said in the report. ""Recent surveys show increasing animosity toward globalization and the power of companies more broadly and a bit more welcoming attitudes toward government regulation of firms.""
There is also more discussion about taxing mega-profitable firms that have benefited from current government policies, it said. 
For example, Europe’s potential ""digital services tax"" is explicitly designed to close the tax arbitrage by introducing a sales tax on online revenues from residents. 

""While the current impact of these proposed rules on the overall profitability of these tech giants is relatively small, they are a straw in the wind that the tide might be turning and that the multi-decade boost from favorable taxation policies is unlikely to be repeated,"" Bridgewater said.

(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reported a 9 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but managed to beat analyst estimates through slight growth in its wealth management business, as well as cost cuts.
Shares of the sixth-largest U.S. bank were up 1.4 percent to $47.69 in morning trading.
Morgan Stanley gets about half its annual revenue from wealth management, which helps it ride out weak periods for trading and investment banking. Both of those businesses suffered during the first quarter at Morgan Stanley and its Wall Street rivals because of subdued volatility.
""This quarter ... shows the resiliency of wealth management, which is an important indicator of the health of our business,"" Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview.
The bank also cut non-interest expenses by 4 percent, which helped boost its bottom line.
Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a quarterly profit of $2.34 billion, or $1.39 per share, down from $2.58 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share. https://mgstn.ly/2vaVd4I
Its revenue fell 7 percent to $10.29 billion.
Both metrics still beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.17 per share and revenue of $9.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Wealth management revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with profit margins holding steady at 27 percent. But the business looks robust compared with institutional securities, analysts said. That unit reported steep declines across trading, underwriting and investment banking.
""Wealth management was able to protect the margin in a tougher backdrop"" than the year-ago period, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients. The performance ""should make people more optimistic considering the lift in markets and better underwriting environment lately.""
Concerns about a slowing global economy, U.S. trade tensions with China and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy spurred worries of recession risk early in 2019. But those concerns seem to have subsided, Pruzan said.
Morgan Stanley's wealth management profit margin and its return on equity of 13.1 percent were comfortably within the targeted range Chief Executive James Gorman has set. Investors watch that return figure closely, because it measures how much profit a bank produces from shareholder capital.
Gorman, who took the helm in 2010, has defined his tenure by building out the wealth management business, dialing back bond trading and generally reducing risk across the franchise.
Like in previous quarters, an analyst asked Gorman on a conference call why he has not lifted performance targets for wealth management, given how easily the business has been meeting the 26 percent to 28 percent range he set.
Gorman again reminded analysts that the margins were far lower when he first set about growing the wealth unit. But now, the business produces returns of nearly 25 percent in difficult times, and might do better, he said, without raising the target.
""There's no magic to this,"" said Gorman. ""It's pretty consistent.""
By contrast, top rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) remains more weighted toward capital markets businesses and is struggling to produce more stable results. On Monday, Goldman reported a 20 percent profit decline and lower revenue across nearly all its major businesses, sending its shares down more than 3 percent.
Analysts also asked about Morgan Stanley's recently announced plan to acquire Solium Capital Inc, a software provider that helps businesses manage employee stock plans.
Gorman explained that the business will help Morgan Stanley interface with roughly 3,000 small companies and 2.5 million individuals. That benefits Morgan Stanley's wealth business, which will oversee the accounts, but also allows the bank to offer cash management services and potentially handle stock offerings for companies that go public.

The transaction is expected to close in May, he said.

Qualcomm's stock spiked  23% in the wake of the news on Tuesday.
The two-mega tech companies headed to court for one day before announcing the settlement, which resolves all claims globally and has Apple paying a fee for the use of Qualcomm technology for at least the next six years. 
The dispute was settled largely in-line with Qualcomm's interpretation of patent rights. Specifically, Qualcomm asserted that all 5G smartphone makers are subject to licensing fees on the use of its technology even if they do not purchase chips directly from Qualcomm. 
""Qualcomm and Apple announced a settlement agreement yesterday that appears to be overwhelmingly positive for Qualcomm despite the absence of details at this time,"" noted JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) research analyst Samik Chatterjee. Chatterjee has an ""overweight"" rating and a price target of $88 for Qualcomm — more than 12% above current trading.
While not specifically announced, the agreement opens the door for Qualcomm to resume its previous role as a chip supplier to Apple. Following news of the settlement, Apple's current chip supplier, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), announced it would  exit the 5G market as the company saw no ""path to profitability."" 
 Apple had previously delayed its entry into the 5G market, in part due to the dispute with Qualcomm. As major rival  Samsung (KS:005930) moved forward with development of its own 5G product suite, Apple faced increasing pressure to settle.
According the Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a data-analytics firm, Qualcomm shorts had lost more than $200 million dollars on Qualcomm through Tuesday after booking mark-to-market profits of $1.3 billion in 2018.
Including Wednesday's premarket gain,  Qualcomm was up 37% year to date.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 09:14AM ET</span>",Comforting China data puts Wall Street records within reach,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street's main markets were eyeing a return to all-time highs on Wednesday after a raft of Chinese data beat expectations, easing concerns about the health of its economy.
Though Europe struggled to join in, MSCI's 47-country world index was at a six-month high, benchmark bond yields shuffled up and the Aussie dollar, which tends to be highly sensitive to China's fortunes, did the same.
With Wall Street also digesting results from the likes of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and U.S. trade data, the Euro Stoxx 600 and German DAX inched higher, though London's FTSE struggled as a near 5 percent drop in iron ore prices hit its miners.
Moves in Asian share markets had been mostly modest too, in part because they had already rallied hard since the start of the year. World stocks are now up 20 percent since late December.
Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.25 percent after hitting a five-month peak while the Shanghai Composite added 0.3 percent to score its highest close since last March and extend a red-hot 2019 run that has seen it boom nearly 35 percent. 
Investors have been counting on better news from China and were not disappointed with first-quarter economic growth pipping forecast at 6.4 percent.
Importantly industrial output surged 8.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace since July 2014 and well above forecasts of a 5.9 percent increase. Retail sales also pleased with a rise of 8.7 percent.
Investors reacted by buying the Australian dollar, often a liquid proxy for China plays, which pushed up 0.3 percent to a two-month top at $0.7206.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors strategist and portfolio manager Neil Dwane said the data had been good enough to allay fears that China's economy was collapsing although the rest of the year remained in question.
""Beijing will now be in a wait and see mode to gauge whether it has done enough,"" Dwane said, referring to stimulus efforts. ""To be bullish (on stocks) from here you would have to believe in a pretty strong global recovery in the second half... We are a bit more ho-hum.""
Still, the fact that there were at least some green shoots appearing in world economy pushed benchmark government bond yields higher. U.S. Treasury 10-year yields were up to 2.6 percent and German Bund yields hit a four-week high, although at 0.1 percent they are still barely above zero. 
In currency markets, the U.S. dollar finally managed to top resistance on the yen at 112.13 to reach its highest since December at 112.16. 
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was a tad weaker at 96.917 but still within the 95.00 to 97.70 range that has held for the past six months.
The euro edged up a touch to $1.1305, recovering from losses driven by a Reuters report that several European Central Bank policymakers think the bank's economic projections are too optimistic.
JUVENTUS THUMPED
One currency on the move was the New Zealand dollar which sank as far as $0.6668 after annual consumer price inflation came in well below expectations at just 1.5 percent for the first quarter. [L3N21Y4Y3]
The improved Chinese data gave it a helping hand back up to $0.6744 later but yields on two-year Kiwi bonds had dived 9 basis points to 1.48 percent as investors wagered the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) would have to cut rates.
In commodity markets, the general improvement in risk sentiment saw spot gold slip to its lowest for the year so far. It was last up 0.2 percent at $1,275 per ounce.
Oil prices were buoyed again as fighting in Libya and falling Venezuelan and Iranian exports raised concerns over tightening global supply. 
U.S. crude was last up 43 cents at $64.44 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 32 cents to $72.03.
The big mover, however, was China's Dalian iron ore futures which plunged after Brazilian miner Vale SA said it was preparing to resume operations at its huge Brucutu mine in the coming days.
The mine, with annual capacity of 30 million tonnes, has remained shut since early February after a tailings dam burst in late January, killing hundreds of people.
The most-traded iron ore futures for September delivery on the Dalian commodity Exchange sank as much as 4.7 and closed down 3.8 percent at 621 yuan ($92.86).
There was soccer drama, too.

Shares in Italian soccer giant Juventus had to be suspended as they dropped more than 20 percent after the team were knocked out of Europe's Champions League by Ajax. Shares in the Dutch club on the other hand celebrated with an 8.5 percent jump.

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will have to tell companies how they rank products on their platforms while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other tech firms will have to be more transparent about their terms and conditions under new EU rules approved on Wednesday.
The platform-to-business (P2B) law, proposed by the European Commission in April last year, is the latest move by Europe to rein in online giants and ensure they treat smaller rivals and users fairly.
Lawmakers at the European Parliament gave the green light to the new laws on Wednesday, which will have to be rubber stamped by the European Council in the coming months before they take effect. Negotiators from all three bodies reached a political deal in February.
The new rules, which will cover 7,000 online companies, target e-commerce market places, app stores, social media and price comparison tools. 
Google's three products Play, Shopping and Search, Apple's App Store, Microsoft's Store and Bing, Amazon Marketplace, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Fnac Marketplace, Facebook's Instagram, Skyscanner, Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) and DuckDuckGo are some of the companies affected by the rules.
""As the first-ever regulation in the world that addresses the challenges of business relations within the online platform economy, it is an important milestone of the Digital Single Market and lays the ground for future developments,"" Andrus Ansip, the Commission's digital chief, said.
The rules include a blacklist of unfair trading practices, require companies to set up an internal system to handle complaints and allow businesses to group together to sue platforms.
The tech industry, which successfully lobbied for the light regulatory regime, welcomed the lawmakers' endorsement.
""This new regulation will positively contribute to achieving the digital single market, while reinforcing trust and predictability online,"" tech lobbying group EDiMA said.

Its members include Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), eBay,  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Facebook, Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Mozilla.

""Last month, we talked to the German Interior Ministry and said that we were ready to sign a no-spy agreement with the German government and to promise that Huawei will not install any backdoors in the networks,"" Wirtschaftswoche quoted Huawei Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei as saying.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 08:21AM ET</span>","China's car market to return to growth this year, executives say","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's car market will return to growth in the second half of this year due to government support although the days of high single or double-digit growth are over and consolidation is likely, senior automotive executives said on Tuesday. 
The predictions from executives including the head of Mitsubishi Motors on the first day of the Shanghai Autoshow point to a vehicle market that is heading for more balanced growth, especially if the trade war with the U.S. is resolved.
Automotive sales in China contracted for the first time last year since the 1990s as a slowing economy and the trade friction between Beijing and Washington affected consumer sentiment.
Recent moves by the Chinese government to cut taxes, carmakers' plans for new model launches as well as the hopes that the U.S.-China trade spat will soon be resolved could start to turn things around, the executives said. 
""We predict there will be negative growth in the first half this year, even double digit,"" said Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd's (GAC) general manager Feng Xingya. 
""But due to government subsidies, carmakers' discounts and better macroeconomic conditions, sales will turn to positive in the second half,"" he said. 
The decline in Chinese automotive sales has already started to slow. They fell by 5.2 percent in March, the smallest decline since August 2018. 
""It's only natural for the China market to transition to slower growth,"" Mitsubishi Motors' Chief Executive Osamu Masuko told Reuters in an interview, saying that the market was showing some ""level of maturity.""
""Going forward the market still has more growth left in it, but it will likely grow moderately. Growth of 5-6 percent a year on a consistent basis might not be that easy to achieve.""
UNEVEN GROWTH
The opening day of the autoshow was marked by launches of new sports utility vehicles from carmakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Daimler, aimed at rejuvenating customer interest with fresh designs in the fast-growing market segment.
Some firms were more optimistic with luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Motor Cars saying that it would likely achieve double digit sales-growth in China again this year, although below 2018 levels.
But others predicted that more pressure is to come as Beijing institutes tough rules to transform the industry which could kick off a round of consolidation or prompt some to leave the Chinese market. 
""That's more likely to happen to small, non state-owned players who really don't have a whole lot to offer,"" said GM's China President Matt Tsien, adding that it could extend to some foreign players. 
The government has this year tightened the screw on makers' ability to add manufacturing capacity and is instituting electric car production quotas for automakers to combat pollution. 

""But I don't believe the number is going to be significant, Tsien said. ""Because at the end of the day this is still one of the most attractive markets in the world. And everybody wants to be here.""

Beverage and packaged food companies have been under pressure from changing consumer preferences and Pepsi has responded by coming up with new recipes and using better ingredients for its snacks and sodas.
PepsiCo has also bolstered its product portfolio to attract customers by acquiring companies such as Bare chips and launching Pepsi Zero Sugar, bubbly sparkling water and Pure Leaf iced teas.
These moves helped the company post a 2.15 percent growth in sales in its North America beverages unit, while sales in its Frito-Lay snacks division rose 5.5 percent.
Organic sales, a key metric that shows the health of Pepsi's legacy brands and strips out impacts from currency fluctuations and acquisitions, rose 5.2 percent, its highest quarterly growth rate in more than three years, the company said https://

670,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",China Is Considering Stimulus Measures to Boost Consumption,"(Bloomberg) -- China is drafting a series of stimulus measures to bolster sales of cars and electronics, according to people familiar with the matter.
The draft includes subsidies for new-energy vehicles, smartphones and home appliances, said the people, who asked not to be named because they aren’t authorized to discuss the plan. The proposals are at a consultation stage with other government branches, and there is no guarantee that they’ll be approved, the people said. The National Development and Reform Commission, which is said to have drafted the plan, didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment.
The move indicates Chinese leaders are stepping up attempts to bolster consumption and mitigate the threats posed by trade tensions with the U.S. The government, which already unveiled its most ambitious tax reduction in years, is seeing some signs its efforts are bearing fruit: retail sales expanded 8.7 percent in March to beat expectations, and first-quarter gross domestic product expanded more than economists estimated.
Speculation over the stimulus swirled in the markets Wednesday, pushing up shares of domestic carmakers such as BYD Co. and automakers in Europe. The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index rose 1.8 percent to an intraday high, led by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Faurecia SA. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). rose in pre-market trading in the U.S. Home-appliance maker Electrolux AB also rose.
It’s notoriously difficult to own a car in major Chinese cities because of quotas put in place to tackle traffic congestion and air pollution. In Beijing, the annual new vehicle quota dropped to 100,000 in 2018, and each licensed gasoline-fueled car has to be idle one day a week. That’s prompted the government to provide incentives for motorists to drive new-energy vehicles -- including pure-battery electrics, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell cars.
Existing ownership restrictions have hindered the growth of car sales, Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said in February. In Beijing and Shanghai, for example, drivers wanting a license plate for a gasoline-powered car must enter a years-long lottery or pay as much as 90,000 yuan.
China’s auto market has been shrinking for months as it goes through its worst slump in a generation. Also, sales during the first half of this year are seeing downward pressure because a cut in purchasing taxes in 2016 and 2017 prompted many consumers to buy vehicles sooner than planned, John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Shanghai, said in February.
Trading in old phones for new ones also would be subsidized under the plan, according to the people. That could help the smartphone industry rebound after shipments declined 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 103 million units, according to International Data Corp. The leading domestic brands include Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). being the only overseas maker ranked in the top five in sales.
The plan also calls for a subsidy of as much as 13 percent on home appliances, setting a maximum of 800 yuan per product, according to the people. Online and offline sales for January and February as reported by China Market Monitor were lackluster. The leading local brands include Gree, Haier and Midea.

671,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 07:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Bancorp Joins List of Banks With Unimpressive Q1 Revenue,"Investing.com - U.S. Bancorp managed to produce first-quarter profit that matched consensus forecasts as loans at the beginning of the year registered solid growth, but revenue fell just short of estimates, following a trend seen in several of its financial sector competitors.
The bank reported earnings per share of $1.00 on revenue of $5.58 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.00 on revenue of $5.59 billion.
The miss on revenue mirrored disappointing top line numbers seen this week from larger rivals Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.
Some financial firms successfully avoided a similar fate in the first three months of the year as JP Morgan set the bar high last Friday, producing quarterly numbers that beat on both the top and bottom lines, while Morgan Stanley also reported better-than-expected numbers on Wednesday.
Andy Cecere - U.S. Bancorp chairman, president and CEO - tried to reassure investors, saying that the first-quarter results were “a good start to the year as momentum is continuing across our lending and fee businesses."" The company is pleased with the results this quarter, and remains ""focused on the long-term success of this company - and the disciplined investment in people and technology that will drive that success,” he said.
Ahead of the open on Wall Street, shares in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) closed the previous session up 0.8% at $50.28.

Wall Street’s second-biggest investment bank said revenue fell by 7.1% from a year earlier, due to declines in revenue from both equity and bond markets, as well as in its advisory business. Investment banking revenues were down 24% from a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $1.39 from $1.45, as the bank offset the drop in revenue by setting aside less money for variable compensation.
As of 0730 AM ET (1130 GMT), the shares were up 3.2% in premarket trading at $48.50
All of Morgan Stanley’s major rivals have posted weak returns on their markets-focused businesses – not least because of comparison effects with an extraordinarily high base a year earlier. However, in contrast to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Morgan Stanley has no meaningful exposure to the consumer or small business lending to compensate.
Even so, revenue of $10.29 billion was nearly 4% better than a consensus forecast of $9.91 billion, while earnings per share of $1.33 was some 14% ahead of forecasts. The bank said around 6c of the earnings improvement was due to “intermittent” tax-related factors.
In a statement, chairman and chief executive James Gorman acknowledged that the bank had had a “slow start” to the year, but said the bank was “well positioned to serve our clients and invest in our business.”
Earlier on Wednesday, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) had fleshed out a solid but unspectacular quarter for the financial sector, eking out a 4% rise in revenue to $5.58 billion in the first three months of the year. That followed a mixed set of numbers on Tuesday from Bank of America, where a sharp drop in revenue from equities and fixed-income trading was offset by a strong performance in retail and business lending.
JPMorgan and Citigroup have emerged as the two biggest winners on Wall Street so far from the first-quarter earnings season. Their shares are up around 5% since Friday.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","TomTom results top estimates, wins two high-definition map deals","(Reuters) - Dutch navigation and digital maps firm TomTom on Wednesday reported a forecast-beating 14 percent rise in first-quarter revenue and said it had won two contracts to supply high-definition maps to carmakers.
""We had a good start of the year, winning the first two available HD map deals, which gives us an early position in this growth market,"" said CEO Harold Goddijn in a statement. 
TomTom in January agreed to sell its fleet management business to Japan's Bridgestone for 910 million euros, in order to concentrate on its digital map-linked businesses, which it has said it expects to grow by around 15 percent to 430 million euros in 2019.
TomTom's prospects took a huge knock last year with the entry of Google's far-reaching supply deal with a group of carmakers including  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and Mitsubishi . 
The Amsterdam-based company also faces a long-term decline in the sales of dashboard-mounted satnav devices.
TomTom said the HD contracts were with two of the world's largest car companies but gave no further detail.
""The key attraction of these wins is strategic,"" said ING analyst Marc Hesselink, who rates the stock a ""buy"". ""By adding clients to the HD platform, TomTom gets more data to improve and update"" it.
Shares were up 3.8 percent to 8.47 euros by 1045 GMT, and are up around 7 percent year to date. 
First-quarter revenue reached 169.5 million euros ($192 million), above an average forecast of 157 million from analysts polled by the company.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 18.8 million euros also beat an average forecast of 12 million.
TomTom stuck to its full-year outlook for revenue of 675 million euros, including 430 million from its location technology, and free cash flow of around 10 percent of revenue.
TomTom also sells mapping services to software makers. Notably, it is the largest provider of digital maps to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , though Apple intends to roll out a maps service in the United States this year using an in-house system.

Washington is scrutinizing state-owned Qatar Airways' acquisition of 49 percent of Air Italy, which has been flying to U.S. destinations since June, a deal that U.S. lawmakers say may have violated a commitment by the Gulf airline not to add new flights to the domestic market.
But in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, JetBlue Airways Corp and cargo carriers FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc said restricting the rights of Qatar Airways and Air Italy could lead to retaliation against U.S. carriers.
""For JetBlue, who just announced its intention to begin service to London from New York City and Boston starting in 2021, the possibility of retaliation could have a devastating impact on the ability to obtain authority to operate in the EU under the U.S.-EU Open Skies agreement,"" the airlines said.
The letter was referring to possible retaliation from the European Union and said restrictions ""would also have a crippling impact on U.S. passenger carriers seeking new service to the EU.""
It was signed by the chief executive officers of the airlines.
""Undoubtedly, closing access to global markets will be a punishment that brings higher prices and fewer choices for American travelers, consumers, and shippers."" 
JetBlue is also considering European destinations beyond London for future flights.
A group representing the three largest U.S. airlines, American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Continental Holdings Inc holds the opposite view and has said it is concerned about Qatar Airways is violating its agreement with the United States.

Qatar Airways has said its stake in Air Italy was ""fully compliant"" with the 2018 U.S.-Qatar Understandings, an additional pact that accompanied the U.S-Qatar Open Skies agreement.

(Reuters) - European shares eased from eight-month highs on Wednesday, weighed down by healthcare and mining stocks while investors looked past better-than-expected first-quarter economic growth in China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT after five straight days of gains. All country indexes were flat to higher except London FTSE 100.
China's economy unexpectedly steadied in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production jumped sharply and consumer demand showed signs of improvement.
Analysts said it was too early to call a sustainable turnaround there, and further policy support would be needed to maintain momentum.
""The reaction in equity markets was muted after the data release, probably because much of the positivity has already been priced in,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
The positive China data spurred demand for auto stocks, the most among European sectors, as concerns over global growth eased. The data also pushed Germany's 10-year government bond yield to a four-week high.
Banks rallied 0.6 percent and drove a 0.3 percent gain in Italy's bank-heavy.
However, losses in basic resources and healthcare stocks outweighed.
BHP Group PLC fell 3 percent, bringing down London's FTSE and the STOXX 600 as the world's biggest miner cut its forecast for iron ore output, a day after rival  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) slashed its output guidance.
The healthcare sector also dropped 1.3 percent as Novartis fell after Jefferies reduced price target on its shares.
Danone slipped 1 percent after the French food group's first-quarter sales slowed on weaker demand for infant formula products in China and a consumer boycott in Morocco.
Its peer Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) dropped about a percent ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday.
 Bunzl  (LON:BNZL) was the worst performer on the pan-European index, down nearly 9 percent after the business supplies distributor said first-quarter growth slowed as the grocery and retail business in its biggest market - North America - remained sluggish.
Also capping losses was the tech sector, helped by a climb in chip stocks and Mobile telecom equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs).
ASML Holding (AS:ASML) rose more than 2 percent after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected first quarter earnings and repeated it expects growth to accelerate through the year.
European chip stocks - AMS, STMicro, Siltronic, Infineon Technologies - were up between 1.5 percent and 5 percent as U.S. peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc surged on Tuesday on an iPhone modem chips deal with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Ericsson ticked about 3 percent higher after beating first-quarter result forecasts and raising full-year outlook for the global networks market.

Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) shares rose 3 percent after a media report that Dutch bank ING added its name to a list of merger suitors. That followed approaches by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Italy's UniCredit

A state takeover work group, which has seized control of Anbang since February last year, has decided to trim the company's registered capital to 41.5 billion yuan ($6.21 billion) from 61.9 billion yuan, pending approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, Anbang said in a statement released on Tuesday.
The capital reduction will not influence the company's operations or cause any major impact on its solvency and financial situations, Anbang said.
The move is the latest step by Beijing to steadily clean up the aftermath of a harsh government crackdown on Anbang - once one of China's most aggressive dealmakers overseas with a series of major acquisitions that have caught the attention of global regulators and investors.
Anbang's former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, who masterminded the overseas deal spree including the purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, was sentenced in May 2018 to 18 years imprisonment for fraud and embezzlement. His appeal against the conviction was rejected by a Chinese court in August last year.

Creditors of the company may request Anbang to pay off its debts or provide repayment guarantees within 45 days after the announcement, the company added.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, chairman of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn, said on Wednesday he will contest Taiwan's 2020 presidential election, shaking up the political landscape at a time of heightened tension between the self-ruled island and Beijing.
Gou, Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, said he would join the already competitive race, and take part in the opposition, China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) primaries.
His decision capped a flurry of news this week that began when Gou told Reuters on Monday he planned to step down from the world's largest contract manufacturer to pave the way for younger talent to move up the company's ranks.
He announced on Tuesday he was considering a presidential bid and hinted he was close to a decision when he told more than 100 people packed into a temple he would follow the instruction of a sea goddess who had told him to run in the presidential race.
""Peace, stability and (Taiwan's) economy future are my core values,"" Gou said later at the KMT's headquarters in Taipei.
He urged the party to rediscover the spirit of the KMT, the honor of KMT members and the KMT's lost support of the youth.
Gou's bid, which requires KMT approval, comes at a delicate time for cross-strait relations and delivers a blow to the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, which is struggling in opinion polls.
China-Taiwan relations have deteriorated since the island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, of the independence-leaning DPP, swept to power in 2016. 
China suspects Tsai is pushing for the island's formal independence. That is a red line for China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will defend Taiwan's security and democracy.
'VERY PRO-CHINA'
A senior adviser to Tsai told Reuters he thought Gou's bid could create problems, given his extensive business ties with China.
""This is problematic to Taiwan's national security,"" the adviser, Yao Chia-wen, said.
""He's very pro-China and he represents the class of the wealthy people. Will that gain support from Taiwanese?"" Yao said, adding he believed Gou would face a tough battle in the KMT primary. 
Tension between Taipei and Beijing escalated again on Monday, as Chinese bombers and warships conducted drills around the island, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets and ships to monitor the Chinese forces. 
The KMT, which once ruled China before fleeing to Taiwan at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949, said in February it could sign a peace treaty with Beijing if it won the hotly contested presidential election.
Zhang Baohui, a regional security analyst at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said Gou's run could mark the start of the most unusual election race in Taiwan history.
""This is something entirely fresh for Taiwan politics – here is a candidate who sees everything through the pragmatic angle of a businessman rather than raw politics or ideology,"" Zhang told Reuters.
""He has no baggage and that will be a fascinating scenario.""
Gou's news comes as Tsai is grappling with a series of unpopular domestic reform initiatives, from a pension scheme to labour law, which have come under intense voter scrutiny.
The KMT said this week Gou had been a party member for more than 50 years and had given it an interest-free loan of T$45 million ($1.5 million) in 2016 under the name of his mother, which had signalled his loyalty to the party.
Foxconn said on Tuesday Gou would remain chairman of Foxconn, though he planned to withdraw from daily operations.

Investment research firm CrossBorder Capital Ltd. sees a more reassuring scenario.
“Liquidity risks over the next six to 12 months continue to fall away, according to our latest assessment from a deep dive into global liquidity data,” the London-based firm that tracks global capital flows wrote in a recent note. “The three factors we closely watch: exposure risk, financing risk and forex risk, appear to have already peaked or at least are in the process of peaking.”
CrossBorder’s report comes after a stream of concerns expressed about the impact of falling liquidity. Goldman strategists have said it may be responsible for the dislocation between equity volatility and economic fundamentals, while JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic said a volatility-liquidity loop can create “violent” markets. Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Sheets cited low liquidity as potentially exacerbating any sell-offs, in a recent interview.
While financing risk still seems elevated, it appears to have peaked amid signs that some major central banks are about to re-start quantitative easing policies, the CrossBorder report said.
The research firm favors a risk-on approach from investors, with the caveat that central banks must return to a “permanent state” of QE, it said. While the latter “is a big ask,” it is “dictated by the changed nature of the financial system,” according to CrossBorder.
Investors should hedge high equity and corporate-bond exposure with securities with greater convexity, a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes, according to the firm.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) posted a first-quarter profit on Wednesday that swept past forecasts due to strong growth in North America and cost cuts, spurring the telecom equipment maker to boost its full-year outlook for the global networks market.
Its shares rose more than 3 percent to a four-year high. 
Profit beat expectations for a fifth straight quarter, as the Swedish company slashes costs following an industry-wide downturn in the middle of the decade, and as a new cycle of network upgrades kicks in for next-generation 5G equipment. 
The company counts Huawei as one of its main rivals and some analysts see potential benefits from Western suspicions of the Chinese group after Washington alleged its gear could be used by Beijing for spying.
Ericsson Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander said the Huawei situation had not yet affected orders but acknowledged security concerns could play a role in customer decisions.
""We said earlier that we don't see it in the order books, but generally speaking the competitiveness we now have in our radio portfolio, through all technology investment we have done, matters,"" Mellander told Reuters.
Huawei has rejected the allegations and launched a lawsuit against the U.S. government.
Excluding restructuring charges related to a revamp of its Business Support System unit and one-off items, the operating margin was 7.2 percent. The company has pledged to hit an underlying target of more than 10 percent in 2020. 
Sales of 5G equipment in North America, the company's biggest market, drove growth, while Europe lagged due partly to a lack of spectrum access, a poor investment climate, and uncertainties related to future vendor market access.
Ericsson said it now expects the Radio Access Network (RAN) equipment market to grow by 3 percent this year, up from a previous forecast for 2 percent growth.
Ericsson also warned that probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) could result in ""material financial and other measures"".
It previously said it had initially received questions from U.S. authorities in March 2013. The company has not commented on media reports that U.S. authorities were investigating its business practices in Romania and China, but said in October it had dismissed 50 people due to the probe.
""We can see now that it is out of the question that we will come out of this with no consequences,"" Mellander said. ""How much and of which nature and when, we really cannot say.""
Ericsson swung to a quarterly operating profit of 4.9 billion crowns from a 312 million loss a year ago, well above a mean forecast for a 2.8 billion profit in a Reuters poll. Sales rose to 48.9 billion versus a forecast of 48.2 billion.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Bill Browder, an investor who campaigns to expose corruption, has taken a criminal complaint against Swedbank to Latvian authorities, alleging it was involved in a Russian money laundering scandal.
Swedbank is being investigated by Swedish and Baltic financial watchdogs after broadcaster SVT reported it processed gross transactions worth up to 20 billion euros ($22.6 billion) a year from high-risk, non-resident clients, mostly Russians, through its Estonian branch between 2010 and 2016.
These inquiries follow a fast-growing money laundering scandal centered on Danske Bank, which said last year that its Estonian branch had been used to move 230 billion euros ($260 billion) of suspicious payments from 2007 to 2015.
Browder, once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia, had already taken the complaint against Swedbank to Swedish and Estonian authorities, alleging that the Swedish bank's accounts were used to launder $176 million from 2006 to 2012.
The bulk of this, $117 million, went through Swedbank's Estonian branch and Browder's complaint lodged with Latvian authorities, dated April 5 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, showed some $41 million had passed through Latvia.
""We cooperate with the authorities in all our home markets in order to resolve current issues. However, we have no comment on the specific cases that Bill Browder now points to,"" a Swedbank spokeswoman said in an emailed response.
Browder's complaint, filed by his Hermitage Capital Management, called on Latvian authorities to look into the allegations alongside their ongoing broader probe into Russian money laundering links. 
Latvian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MAGNITSKY CASE
Browder has pushed for banks to be held accountable over links to a money laundering and tax fraud exposed by his former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian jail in 2009.
He had previously brought cases against Swedbank's rivals Nordea and Danske Bank, which is now the subject of investigations in the United States, France, Denmark, Estonia and Britain.
Estonia is including Browder's Swedbank complaint in its Danske Bank inquiry, but Sweden dropped its investigation saying there were limited transfers involving Swedish accounts and that the statute of limitations had expired.
Sweden, along with authorities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, is set to conclude its investigation into Swedbank later this year, while a separate Swedish economic crime agency inquiry into the bank's conduct was expanded last month.

687,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 04:20AM ET</span>",Investors Fretting Anemic Europe Inflation Bet on Lower Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are betting the European Central Bank will fall short of its inflation goal in coming years, entrenching lower yields in the region.
Expectations for euro-area inflation in the swap market is holding near the lowest in two years, ahead of a consumer-price readout Wednesday. That’s giving fuel to traders buying bonds amid signs policy makers haven’t agreed a course of action to back up ECB President Mario Draghi’s recent dovish rhetoric.
European bond yields have fallen to multi-year lows as talk of “Japanification”, where inflation and volatility remain permanently low, peppers analyst notes. Draghi acknowledged last week that the economic weakness could extend into the rest of the year, following a dovish tilt from the bank earlier in the year that upended market bets on an interest-rate hike anytime soon.
“The ultimate result will be lower rates and lower rates vol,” said Joubeen Hurren, a money manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, who has a long position in inflation-linked Treasuries.
Euro-area annual inflation is expected to come in at 1.4 percent for March, slower than 1.5 percent the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Five-year, five-year inflation swaps, the ECB’s preferred gauge of inflation, touched 1.24 percent in March, the lowest in over two years.
Speculation has mounted that the ECB could add stimulus by tiering its deposit rate to ease pressure on banking profit margins, but officials lack enthusiasm for any revamp of the negative rate policy, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
In the absence of that, markets are likely to focus on a new wave of cheap loans for banks, known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which could be announced in June. Until then they will watch for any signs in European data that an economic recovery in China is filtering through into the global economy.
For Pacific Investment Management Co., sliding inflation raises questions over whether the ECB has the will or the instruments left to combat it. The bank could enter “the next recession without ever having normalized its policy stance,” said Pimco money managers Andrew Bosomworth and Konstantin Veit.

The Amsterdam-based club’s stock soared.
Juventus, whose stock lost about 400 million euros ($453 million) in market value at its low, went ahead in the the twenty-eighth minute, courtesy of 34-year-old, five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, but Ajax’s youth prevailed, with goals from two academy players -- 21-year-old Donny van de Beek and 19-year-old Matthijs de Ligt -- to send the club into its first Champions League semi-final since 1997.
Ajax now has the chance to boost its annual revenue by more than a third. Reaching the semis has earned Ajax an added 12 million euros ($13.6 million) in prize money, with a further 19 million euros potentially up for grabs if the team progresses further. That’s before ticketing and merchandising revenue, and greater leverage with commercial sponsors for a club that’s earned a place back on global soccer’s biggest stage. Ajax had adjusted revenue of about 92 million euros in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
For Juventus, it’s a setback for the club backed by the billionaire Agnelli family, whose purchase of Ronaldo last year was seen as in part driven by a desire to win the competition. It’s the first time the Champions League semi-final will not feature the Portuguese superstar for nine years, according to the statistics website Opta.
Juve’s stock had rallied since the quarter-final draw last month as bookmakers made the Turin team known as “La Vecchia Signora,” or “The Old Lady"" a firm favorite to progress. The stock soared 17 percent on March 13 after a Ronaldo hat trick turned around a two-goal deficit against Spain’s Atletico Madrid to secure a quarter-final place.
Ajax jumped 8.8 percent to 18.65 euros at 9:10 a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 342.8 million euros. Juventus plunged 22 percent to 1.32 euros for a market value of 1.3 billion euros.

689,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 03:41AM ET</span>",ABB seeks new chief executive after Spiesshofer's surprise departure,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer has quit the Swiss engineering group in a surprise move for a company which is in the midst of a strategic overhaul to focus more on digital industries.
Chairman Peter Voser will take charge at ABB, which is selling its Power Grids business to Japan's Hitachi in an $11 billion deal and seeking to become more of an industrial automation company.
Spiesshofer agreed with the board to step down from the post he has held for the last five and half years and a search has begun for a successor, ABB said, without giving any reason for the departure.
During his tenure Spiesshofer positioned ABB toward more profitable areas like industrial automation and robotics, buying companies like Austria's Bernecker & Rainer and General Electric's industrial solutions business.
But Spiesshofer's exit follows the apparent lack of investor enthusiasm for the former management consultant whose overhauls failed to revitalize ABB's shares, which gained 4 percent in early trade on news of his departure to touch a six-month high.
ABB's stock has lost 6.5 percent since Spiesshofer took over in September 2013, trailing rivals like Germany's Siemens which have gained nearly 19 percent in the same time.
Patience appears to have worn thin when major strategy u-turns like the decision to offload Power Grids to Hitachi last December failed to boost the stock, which has languished well below the 35 franc level Spiesshofer promised to reach.
Investor AB, ABB's largest shareholder, said the time was ripe for a change of leadership.
CUSTOMER VALUE
""Investor AB fully supports the ABB board and management’s new strategic direction with a simplified and decentralized organizational structure and full focus on delivering customer value and needs for digitalization, electrification, automation and robotics,"" an Investor spokeswoman said by email. 
""We support the board’s decision that now is the right time for a new person at the helm in order to speed up the execution of the new strategy and deliver on the key financial targets,"" she added.
Cevian Capital, ABB's second-largest shareholder with a 5.3 percent stake, said: ""We support the strategic direction of ABB, and have full confidence in Peter Voser and the management team to continue implementing the transformation of ABB.""
ABB has also been dogged by problems with its internal financial controls, which led to reduced bonuses for some executive committee members.
ABB said its revenue increased by 4 percent on a comparable basis during the first quarter, although net income dropped 6 percent as profitability fell due to the integration of the low-margin  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Industrial Solutions business.
Voser, the former Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO who was ABB's chief financial officer from 2002 to 2004, said he would continue to make ABB more of an industrial automation company.

""To achieve our key financial targets, we will proceed with the divestment of ABB's Power Grids business as planned, simplify the organizational structure of the group and deliver cost savings,"" Voser said.

Investing.com -- Nothing makes a financial journalist feel worse about his or her career choices than a disaster.The shock of the event is routinely followed by the grim realization that our place in the scheme of things is to talk about the impact on insurance stocks.
The catastrophic fire that ravaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is a case in point. The staggering scale of loss is immediately evident, so it would be natural to suspect that AXA (PA:AXAF), France's biggest insurer, may be seriously on the hook for the reconstruction.
So you'd be surprised to hear that its stock hit a 13-month high on Tuesday, especially after it confirmed that it was the insurer to two contractors on restoration works whose activity may have been linked to the fire. It's up another 0.4% at the time of writing on Wednesday.
That isn't just down to the fact that France's business elite has already promised 700 million euros to cover reconstruction costs, a figure that will probably be augmented by public donations.
This key part of a statement released by  Axa  late on Tuesday explains why it's shielded from the worst:
“The Notre Dame cathedral is classified as a historical monument since 1862, and like all properties belonging to the state, it is self-insured by the state (therefore AXA is not the insurer for the monument itself).""
But the insurance giant isn't out of the woods yet, as the rest of the statement shows:
""Among the many companies working on the on-going construction projects of the cathedral, AXA France provides civil-liability coverage to two companies: Europe Echafaudage and Le Bras Frères.""
Additionally, AXA Art is involved in the insurance of certain artefacts and ceremonial objects in the Notre-Dame.
The cause of the fire is still unknown and being investigated. AXA said all its teams are ""fully cooperating"" with the authorities.
AXA's shares are still over 10% below where they started 2018, having spent most of last year trying to convince investors of the merits of its $15.3 billion acquisition of XL, a deal that made it the world's biggest property and casualty insurer.
However, they have risen 26% since the start of the year, according to data compiled by Investing.com, and still offer what by local standards is an attractive yield of 5.69%.
Elsewhere, it's another strong morning for Europe's bourses, with major indexes rising between 0.1% and 0.4% in response to stronger-than-expected Chinese growth data for the first quarter. The U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.2%, however, as is the Euro STOXX 600."

693,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 03:25AM ET</span>",Qualcomm stock jumps 23 percent on surprise settlement with Apple,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Tuesday won a major victory in its wide-ranging legal dispute with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the companies reached a surprise settlement that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips.
Shares of Qualcomm jumped 23 percent to $70.45 in regular trading, their biggest gain in more than 19 years, then hit $75.25 in after-hours trading. 
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), which had been Apple's sole iPhone chip supplier for the past year amid intensifying conflict with Qualcomm, said hours after the settlement was announced that it would exit the modem chip business. 
The Qualcomm settlement also incorporates a six-year patent license and a payment from Apple to Qualcomm, but the companies did not disclose the amount.
Because Qualcomm is already shipping 5G chips while Intel was still developing them, the deal helps Apple in its battle with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and other manufacturers whose phones already work on the faster networks.
“This is a big win"" for Qualcomm, said Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. 
The settlement followed two years of increasingly bitter legal battles between the two companies and came as opening arguments took place at a trial in federal court in San Diego. 
Intel said Tuesday it was exiting the phone modem business and would focus its 5G efforts on other devices such as networking gear.
Shares of Intel were up 2.7 percent at $58.25 in after hours trade. Apple was barely changed after hours.
“Intel isn’t trading lower because modems represent such a small portion of revenues for the company,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy.
The deal could help Qualcomm return to the preeminent position it held in the early 2010s when it dominated the transition to 4G mobile networks and expanded revenues dramatically.
Apple had accused Qualcomm of using illegal patent practices to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect phones to mobile data networks. Qualcomm had said Apple was using its technology without paying for it.
Qualcomm and Apple did not say when their new supply agreement would start. Because Intel does not expect to have a 5G chip ready for phones until next year, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Apple is most likely tapping Qualcomm for its 5G chip. 
Intel's exit from the modem business does not necessarily mean Qualcomm will become Apple's sole supplier. Apple executives testified in January at a trial between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Qualcomm that Apple's policy is always seek several suppliers.
Moreover, during the FTC trial Apple executives disclosed they had held talks with Samsung and MediaTek Inc about possibly using their 5G modems for 2019 iPhones. 
Apple this year also moved its modem engineering efforts into the same group that makes its proprietary chips, signaling that the iPhone maker is also seriously pursuing its own modem.
BOOST TO EARNINGS
Qualcomm said the arrangements are expected to generate $2 per share in additional earnings, though analysts cautioned it was not clear how much of that was coming from the license deal versus the supply agreement.
Analysts were also unsure whether Apple's a onetime payment under the deal represented unpaid royalties from the past two years or a down payment on future royalties.
The settlement could also have an impact on China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which is also in a licensing dispute with Qualcomm. Analysts widely believe that Huawei was watching the outcome of the Apple case to gauge its bargaining position.
Finally, the U.S. FTC case against Qualcomm that makes many of the same claims of anticompetitive behavior remains unresolved, with a decision expected at any time.
A jury of six men and three women was in the process of hearing opening arguments from Apple and Qualcomm when news of the settlement broke.
In addition to the federal lawsuit, the companies had lodged litigation in dozens of jurisdictions around the world, including Qualcomm efforts to ban iPhone sales in Germany and China and a state court case in San Diego where Qualcomm accused Apple of helping steal its chip secrets to benefit Intel. 
Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm in January 2017, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. 
Later Qualcomm hit back with its own lawsuit, alleging that Apple used its heft in the electronics business to wrongly order contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Co Ltd's Foxconn to withhold royalty payments from Qualcomm that Apple had historically reimbursed to the factories.
As part of the settlement, Qualcomm will also end litigation with Apple's contract manufacturers. 

Intel did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",Britain's markets watchdog to review post-Brexit rules,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog will review its rules as the country readies to leave the European Union, the source of its financial regulation for decades.
""Post-Brexit, we need to consider the future of regulation to ensure the regulatory landscape is fit for the challenge it faces,"" the Financial Conduct Authority said in its new annual business plan published on Wednesday.
The watchdog's chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said Brexit will be the most immediate challenge its faces.
""In order to ensure we are a regulator that continues to serve the public interest, we need to adapt to the ever-changing environment,"" Bailey said.
The debate is likely to be heated.
Backers of Brexit say that leaving the EU gives Britain an opportunity to ease what they see as burdensome rules from the bloc, to maintain London as a competitive global financial center.
Others, however, want Britain to stay aligned to the bloc, the biggest customer of Britain's financial sector.
Britain's finance ministry and parliament's Treasury Select Committee (TSC) have already announced plans to review financial regulation.
The FCA said the review would look at issues such a as the cost of rules, and equivalence, the EU's system of granting market access to non-EU financial firms.
Equivalence largely rests on staying aligned to the bloc's rules, but the FCA and the Bank of England have warned against Britain becoming a ""rule taker"" or having to continually copy EU rules.
Britain has cut and pasted the EU's equivalence regime into national law.
TSC Chair Nicky Morgan has said that the debate over the future of regulation could take decades to decide given deep philosophical divisions.

The FCA also said it will provide guidance to the finance ministry on extending the watchdog's enforcement powers in the cryptocurrency sector, including its oversight of security tokens which resemble shares or debt, and utility tokens, which allow access to products or services without giving holders any rights.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>","Lessors rush to repossess more Jet Airways planes, even as emergency funds awaited","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Lessors to India's Jet Airways Ltd have applied to deregister another four Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 planes, the Indian aviation regulator said on its website on Wednesday, even as the embattled carrier seeks emergency funding from its lenders.
Latest analysis of data disclosed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation shows that Jet's lessors have, so far, sought to deregister and repossess at least four dozen of the planes operated by Jet. Once deregistered, lessors are free to reclaim a plane and lease it to another airline anywhere in the world.
The moves come even as Jet scrambles to secure emergency funds and its lenders try to hurry through a sale process to identify an investor willing to acquire a majority stake in the airline and attempt to turn it around. 
Lenders are likely to invite binding bids from four shortlisted suitors, private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, Indian sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and the UAE's Etihad Airways that already owns a minority stake in Jet, local media reported.
TPG declined to comment, while the other three did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. 
Jet will be forced to shut down as soon as Wednesday if it does not get emergency funding from its lenders, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Jet CEO Vinay Dube said on Tuesday in a letter to employees, seen by Reuters, that the carrier had stressed to its lenders the need for some urgent funding, critical to the continuation of its operations.
At its peak, Jet had over 120 planes and hundreds of daily flights. The airline, once India's leading private carrier, has been forced in recent months to cancel hundreds of flights to dozens of domestic and overseas destinations.
On its website, Jet Airways disclosed it was operating only about three dozen flights on Wednesday. 
Shares in the company, which have tumbled about 60 percent in the last year, closed on Tuesday at 240.50 rupees a share.

The company still has a market capitalization of $393.8 million, as investors cling to hopes of a rescue. Indian markets were closed due to a public holiday on Wednesday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche raised its 2019 outlook after first-quarter sales rose 8 percent, beating analyst estimates on the strength of newer medicines including multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus and cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq. 
Sales are now expected to grow in the mid-single-digit range at constant exchange rates, Roche said on Wednesday, up from the previous forecast of low-to-mid-single-digit growth. Core earnings per share were seen broadly mirroring sales growth.
Revenue rose to 14.8 billion Swiss francs ($14.70 billion), compared to the 14.2 billion franc average estimate in an Infront Data poll for Reuters. Ocrevus sales rose 67 percent to 836 million francs. Tecentriq more than doubled to 336 million francs.
While the Basel-based drugmaker's big-selling cancer drugs Rituxan and Herceptin continued to be buffeted by competition from copies in Europe, Chief Executive Severin Schwan's bet on newer medicines like Ocrevus and Tecentriq to offset the hit to his portfolio's older drugs continues to pay off. 
""We have started the year with strong sales growth, driven by the newly launched products in our pharmaceuticals division,"" Schwan said in a statement. ""Demand for our new medicines remains high."" 
Pharmaceuticals sales rose 10 percent, at constant currency exchange rates, to 11.9 billion francs, largely driven by accelerating business in China, Roche's second-biggest market now after the United States. Diagnostics sales were 1 percent higher, at 2.9 billion francs.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has asked French utility Suez SA to help the country's efforts to tackle underlying safety issues in its massive chemical sector after a deadly explosion in the eastern coastal city of Yancheng last month, a company executive said.
A pesticide plant blast on March 21 killed 78 people, caused severe structural damage in nearby residential buildings and forced authorities to seal off a river to protect local drinking water.
Authorities were in touch with Suez in the aftermath of the blast to discuss contamination risks at the site, and also to get involved in China's long-term efforts to improve safety management, monitoring and transparency in the hazardous chemical sector, said Steve Clark, chief executive of Suez Asia. 
""They contacted us, as well as other companies I'm sure, to see if we could help on some short-term issues, and to see if we are willing to get involved on a more strategic scale to make sure that these problems don't happen again,"" Clark told reporters.
""Our answer was obviously 'yes',"" he said. ""Quite frankly, we don't want just to be the operator of plants. We want to be involved in strategic management as well."" 
The environment ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
China is still investigating the causes of the blast, but 26 people have already been detained, including employees at the plant's owner, the Tianjiayi Chemical Company. The firm has also been accused of violating safety guidelines in the past, state media has reported.
Authorities have already launched nationwide inspection campaigns into chemical production, fire safety and transportation, and widespread closures of small and unsafe plants are expected. The Xiangshui chemical park, where the blast occurred, will be shut down. 
Suez already runs five hazardous waste treatment plants in China. Another is under construction and the company hopes to build around two new plants a year in the coming years. 
One of Suez's facilities at the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP) incinerates dangerous materials from 92 companies, including China's Sinopec and Germany's BASF and Evonik.
China has sought to close small-scale chemical producers and consolidate production in massive zones like SCIP, enabling safety and emission controls to be implemented and monitored more effectively. 
""I'm sure that one of the outcomes of this incident is even more awareness that proper management of hazardous waste just has to happen,"" said Clark. ""We see this need growing more and more.""

(Reuters) - The White House has told two U.S. House Democrats it will not turn over documents that could show whether Republican President Donald Trump sought to intervene in the regulatory review of AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc’s $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
In March, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs a panel overseeing antitrust issues, asked the White House and Justice Department to turn over records after The New Yorker magazine reported Trump directed then-National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn to use the Justice Department to block the deal.
The pair wrote that if accurate, Trump’s involvement would “constitute a grave abuse of power.” In February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court ruling rejecting a Justice Department challenge to the deal filed in November 2017.
Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and later saying it would raise prices. He has also frequently attacked CNN, a Time Warner property now owned by AT&T, for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration.
In a letter dated Monday and released on Tuesday by Cicilline, White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined to release any documents, saying he would not provide ""protected communications between the president and his senior advisers that are the very core of the executive branch's confidentiality interests.""
Cipollone added that the Justice Department would be responding ""in due course.""
The two Democrats responded in a joint statement that ""the White House Counsel has made a blanket claim that all White House communications — regardless of whether they contain evidence of improper or even unlawful activities — are protected by a cone of secrecy,"" adding they would ""pursue this matter.""
Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a 2018 declaration he had never received “orders, instructions, or directions relating” to the AT&T-Time Warner deal from Trump, Justice Department officials or White House officials.
The Justice Department said in February it would not seek further appeals to block the merger.
In February 2018, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected AT&T’s request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether Trump pressured the Justice Department to try to block the deal.
AT&T lawyers said last year the deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country. AT&T declined comment on Tuesday.

Sprint shares fell about 9 percent after the bell as investors increased bets the deal would not be completed following a Wall Street Journal report the merger is unlikely to be approved as currently structured. Shares of T-Mobile fell 4 percent.
The deal had been criticized by consumer advocates and some lawmakers because it would reduce the number of national wireless carriers available to consumers to three from four.
T-Mobile has defended the proposed merger, saying the combined company would be better and faster at building 5G, the next generation of wireless, to compete with industry leaders AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). 
A final decision on the deal is likely near the end of the 180-day Federal Communications Commission review period that expires in June. 
T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere was in Washington on Tuesday and has meetings later this week at the FCC, two people briefed on the matter said. 
Legere said on Twitter it was ""simply untrue,"" as had been reported, that Justice Department staff had told the companies the deal was unlikely to be approved in its current form. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure said the Wall Street Journal report was not accurate. ""We continue to have discussions with regulators about our proposed merger with 
@TMobile. That process is ongoing,"" Claure wrote on Twitter. 
A third person familiar with the investigation said the probe was going along as expected, adding there had been no serious discussion of any divestitures of spectrum or other assets and that much of the conversation with regulators had been about proposed efficiencies in the development of 5G. 
The agreement to combine the carriers, struck in April 2018, was approved by both companies’ shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Justice Department and FCC. A number of state attorneys general are also reviewing the deal.
LAWMAKERS QUESTION DEAL
Executives from both companies faced tough questions from lawmakers in February about how the companies' planned merger would affect prices and jobs, especially in rural America.
A group of eight Democratic U.S. senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders urged the Justice Department and FCC to reject the deal, saying monthly bills could rise as much as 10 percent.
To win support for the deal, T-Mobile had said it would not increase prices for three years and has pledged to use some spectrum for wireless broadband in rural areas.
Legere has also pledged to build 5G without using networking equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or ZTE Corp (HK:0763), two Chinese telecommunications firms distrusted by U.S. national security experts.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 08:43PM ET</span>",Minnesota student sues China's JD.com CEO Liu with allegation of rape,"By Koh Gui Qing and Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - A University of Minnesota student who said she was raped last August by Richard Liu, the chief executive officer of China's e-commerce retailer JD.com Inc, filed a civil lawsuit against him in a Minneapolis court on Tuesday, nearly four months after prosecutors declined to press criminal charges.
Liu, through his lawyers, maintained his innocence throughout the law enforcement investigation, which ended in December.
The lawsuit filed in Hennepin County court seeks undisclosed damages and names Richard Liu and JD.com as defendants. It also identifies the student for the first time as Liu Jingyao, a Chinese woman who is not related to the JD.com executive.
""Defendant Liu was physically larger in size and significantly stronger than the plaintiff and used his superior size and strength to subdue and rape her,"" the court document said.
Richard Liu's attorney, Jill Brisbois, said in a written statement on Tuesday that she had not yet reviewed the complaint, but ""based on the Hennepin County attorney’s declination to charge a case against our client and our belief in his innocence, we feel strongly that this suit is without merit and will vigorously defend against it.""
Peter Walsh, an attorney for JD.com at Hogan Lovells, said in a written statement while they were not prepared to comment at this time, they will vigorously defend against ""these meritless claims against the company.""
The student first accused Richard Liu of rape in August when he was visiting the University of Minnesota to attend a doctor of business administration program directed at executives from China.
Liu, 46, who started JD.com as a humble electronics stall and expanded it into an e-commerce company with 2018 net revenues of $67 billion, was arrested on Aug. 31, but released without charge about 17 hours later. 
He soon returned to China and continued his executive role, as prosecutors in Minnesota investigated the rape allegation to determine if criminal charges were warranted.
In December, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman announced he was not charging Richard Liu as there were ""profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""
Richard Liu said subsequently on Chinese social media that while he had broken no law, he felt ""utter self-admonishment and regret"" for the ""enormous pain"" his ""actions on that day"" caused his family, especially his wife, internet celebrity Zhang Zetian.
Also known as Liu Qiangdong, he would have faced up to 30 years in prison under Minnesota law if convicted of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct.
Reuters previously reported details of what happened while Richard Liu was in Minneapolis for a week-long residency program at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, including a description of the alleged attack and the events around it given by the then-anonymous student.
""We are proud of the incredible courage our client has shown revealing her name for all the world to see, so that justice may be done,"" Florin Roebig, P.A., one of the law firms representing Liu Jingyao, said in a statement on Tuesday.
Florin Roebig declined to comment on the amount they were seeking in damages, but the court filing showed it was more than the $50,000 threshold required.
Spokesmen for the University of Minnesota and the Hennepin County Attorney declined to comment on the lawsuit.
JD.COM 'VICARIOUSLY LIABLE'
The lawsuit accused Richard Liu and JD.com of a total of six counts of false imprisonment, civil assault and battery, as well as sexual assault or battery.
JD.com is ""vicariously liable"" for Richard Liu's behavior because his alleged actions happened while he was ""seemingly"" at work-related activities, the court document said. The assault and battery also began in the presence of two other JD.com employees, Vivian Yang Han and Alice Zhang Yujia, the court filing said. 
Yang, when reached on her cellphone for comment, hung up. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment.
""Those employees were not only present but helped facilitate"" Richard Liu's alleged assault of the student, according to the lawsuit.
""The offensive contact caused the plaintiff physical and emotional injuries,"" the court filing said. ""It also caused her to withdraw from all classes during the fall 2018 semester at the University of Minnesota and to seek professional counseling, care and treatment.""

The lawsuit said that when police visited the student's apartment after being alerted to the rape allegation, Richard Liu tried to intimidate her from cooperating with law enforcement, according to an officer's body camera footage. The lawsuit said Liu was ""staring down"" at her while being removed from her apartment, angrily saying ""'What the hell?'""

(Reuters) - International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, hurt by tapering demand for its mainframe computers and a stronger dollar, sending its shares down about 3 percent.
The technology giant's revenue at all its main business units except cloud, which has been the centerpiece of its turnaround strategy, missed analysts' estimates.
IBM's cloud and cognitive segment, which includes analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, fell 1.5 percent to $5.04 billion in the quarter, but beat FactSet estimates of $4.18 billion.
""We saw good acceleration in our cloud business... We now have an improving trajectory as we move forward,"" Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said.
Under Ginni Rometty's stewardship, the company has shed many of its traditional hardware businesses and beefed up the growth areas through deals such as its $34 billion acquisition for Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT).
 IBM  returned to annual revenue growth in the last quarter of 2018, triggering expectations that its strategy was taking roots.
The company's systems segment, which houses its mainframe computer business, fell 11.5 percent to $1.33 billion in the reported quarter, missing FactSet estimates of $1.37 billion.
Its overall revenue slipped 4.7 percent to $18.18 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 and missed the average analyst estimate of $18.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its net income fell to $1.59 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $1.68 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, the company earned $2.25 per share and beat analysts' expectation of $2.22 per share.

The company on Tuesday maintained its adjusted operating profit for 2019 to be ""at least"" $13.90 per share. Analysts on an average were expecting $13.91 per share.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 07:47PM ET</span>",No-frills no longer: GM's China brand Baojun attempts a major makeover,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
LIUZHOU, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - By many measures, General Motors' China brand Baojun has been an exceptional success story, growing at breakneck speed by selling low-cost no-frills vehicles in smaller cities and rural areas. 
But as Chinese consumer tastes shift away from basic and affordable, Baojun is engineering a different image for itself - launching mid-market models that will sport a redesigned logo and be sold through new or revamped showrooms.
The move is aimed at ensuring Baojun has offerings in the 100,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan ($15,000-$22,300) range that holds the most potential for the brand, said Mike Devereux, executive vice president at SGMW, GM's venture with Chinese partners SAIC Motor Corp and Guangxi Automobile Group. 
""When you look at what might happen in terms of some of the shrinking segments, you are going to make sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket,"" he told Reuters in an interview. 
The first model off the block is the RS-5 SUV, which went on sale last week.
More sleekly designed than other Baojun vehicles, it is the first to feature semi-autonomous driving technology and will be priced from 96,800 yuan to 132,800 yuan. By comparison the most expensive model under Baojun's old badge is priced from 85,800 yuan to 117,800 yuan.
Another three models will be rolled out this year, Devereux said, declining to provide further details on the cars. 
GM executives and analysts see Baojun's move upmarket as a natural progression as the brand seeks to stay relevant to younger consumers.
It is also supported by a large existing customer base. Most of Baojun's sales are in smaller and less economically developed cities, but those were areas few Western automakers sought to target and the brand, which only got its start in 2011, rocketed to sales of almost 1 million in 2017.
Amid a slowing economy, sales slipped last year to around 840,000, accounting for 23 percent of GM vehicles sold in China.

Han Dehong, senior sales manager at SGMW, said the venture had been exploring a makeover of the Baojun brand since 2014 in tandem with a wide-ranging overhaul of its R&D, supply chain and distribution system.
""Younger groups have become the main force of consumer spending in our society and we need to respond to this new younger wave with brand upgrades and revamped models,"" he said. 
NEW SHOWROOMS, BIGGER CITIES 
Compared to 10 years ago when there few models in the mid-market price range, competition has become fierce. Popular models include Toyota Motor Corp's Corolla and Volkswagen's Lavida. VW's newly launched Jetta brand, which like Baojun is a China-only brand, is expected to also be sold in the same range.
""Baojun will need a competitive edge,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, noting that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is known for quality, Geely Automobile Holdings is known for design while Great Wall Motor vehicles offer roomy interiors.
To set itself apart, the revamped Baojun brand will emphasize self-driving technology and internet connectivity, GM officials said.
The new models will be sold in 365 new or refurbished showrooms, equivalent to 60 percent of Baojun stores across China. The brand will also strengthen its presence in bigger cities like Chengdu, Tianjin and Nanjin.
A new mobile phone app was also recently launched, allowing customers to arrange a test drive and buy the new models online.
GM officials declined to say how much the automaker had invested in the new models, the logo redesign and new stores.
The move upmarket for Baojun is partial as some cheaper models will still carry the old Baojun badge although others will be folded into the Wuling brand, - the other marque sold by SGMW, said Matt Tsien, GM's chief in China.
Tsien said GM had little concern that a more upmarket Baojun might eat into sales of GM's Chevrolet as Chinese customers interested in buying a Chevy tend not to be attracted to domestic brands.
Roughly equivalent vehicles would also be priced differently. Whereas the most expensive version of the RS-5 will cost 132,800 yuan, the Chevy Equinox SUV will start from 174,900 yuan.

""No matter how far you take Baojun, Baojun is still going to be domestic, it's going to focus on the local market here and it's going to still represent very good value for customers,"" said Tsien.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 06:39PM ET</span>",Buyout firm Apollo to buy Smart & Final Stores for $1.1 billion,"By Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC said on Tuesday it will acquire Smart & Final Stores Inc for about $1.1 billion, including debt, the second time the private equity firm will own the U.S. food retailer.
The deal comes after Apollo sold Smart & Final to Ares Management Corp, another buyout firm, in 2012 for $975 million, including debt. It is Apollo's latest bet on the brick-and-mortar grocery sector, even after its last acquisition in the space, its $1.4 billion leveraged buyout of Fresh Market Inc in 2016, has soured amid increasing competition.
Apollo will pay $6.50 per share in cash for Smart & Final, a 21 percent premium to its closing share price on Tuesday. The shares soared in after-hours trading after Reuters reported on the deal ahead of the announcement.
Smart & Final operates 324 grocery and food service stores in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Montana and Utah.
Ares took Smart & Final public in 2014 at a price of $12 per share. The shares have lost close to half their value since then, as the company struggled in a tough environment for brick-and-mortar retailers. Ares now owns close to 60 percent of the company.
Based in Commerce, California, Smart & Final faces competition from direct rivals and e-commerce firms. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquired Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion in 2017. 
Deep-pocketed international entrants to the U.S. market such as Lidl and Ahold Delhaize, as well as discount retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG), have also been squeezing Smart & Final's profitability.
Apollo plans to split Smart & Final into two operationally separate units, because of their different business model, according to people familiar with the matter.
One unit will comprise the 257 stores operated under the Smart & Final banner, which allow consumers to shop at a discount without a membership fee.
The second unit will comprise 67 stores under the company's Smart Foodservice banner, which sell goods in a no-frills warehouse format to other food businesses such as restaurants and caterers.
Apollo's previous acquisition in the grocery sector, the Fresh Market, has struggled amid a plethora of organic and natural food offerings by rivals. Its bonds trade well below their par value, and credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service has called its capital structure ""unsustainable"".

To be sure, Apollo has enjoyed success in the grocery sector as well. It made 10 times its $200 million investment when it cashed out of organic grocer Sprouts Farmers Markets Inc in 2015.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 06:10PM ET</span>","Brazil's Petrobras hires JPMorgan, Citi to manage BR Distribuidora offering: sources","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - State-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA has hired nine banks to manage an offering of shares in its fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The offering will be led by the investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), along with the investment banks owned by Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) ,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Banco do Brasil SA,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, is among the assets that Petrobras intends sell to reduce its debt and increase investments in oil exploration. 
Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco took the helm of the company in January with an ambitious divestment program.
Petrobras, Citi, JPMorgan, BB, BofA and HSBC did not immediately comment. Bradesco, Itau, CS and Santander declined to comment.
Petrobras has not decided yet if the offering will mean a privatization of BR Distribuidora, added the sources, who spoke on Monday and Tuesday. They asked for anonymity because the talks were private.
If Petrobras decides to sell 22 percent or more of the company, the share offering will effectively privatize the fuel distribution unit.
A sale of a 20 percent stake would be worth around 5.3 billion reais ($1.3 billion), based on market prices as of Tuesday afternoon. The company's market capitalization is 26.7 billion reais. 
But the company is still discussing if a privatization through a share offering would need to be submitted to Brazil's audit court, although Castello Branco has said his initial intention is to privatize the fuel distribution arm. Currently, Petrobras holds a 71.25 percent stake in BR Distribuidora.

The timing of the offering is still under discussion, but it will likely occur after the sale of a stake owned by state lender Caixa Economica Federal in Petrobras, the sources added. Caixa hired the banks for the offering last week.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 06:00PM ET</span>",Netflix forecast disappoints as streaming competition looms,"By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) gave a weak forecast on Tuesday that unnerved investors just as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and others prepare to escalate Hollywood's streaming video wars, although the company's quarterly results beat Wall Street targets.
Shares of Netflix traded down about 1 percent at $355.02 in after-the-bell trading.
Netflix predicted it would pick up 5 million new streaming subscribers from April through June. That was below the 5.48 million consensus of industry analysts surveyed by FactSet.
""What's making investors nervous is that there are signs of a slowdown in the second-quarter subscriber growth,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""This is made all the more prominent by the looming threat of competition from Disney and Apple.""
Netflix added a record number of paid streaming customers in the first quarter, reaching a total of 148.86 million.
The just-ended first quarter included the debut of original dramas ""Sex Education"" and ""Russian Doll,"" and the company raised prices in the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it saw ""some modest short-term churn effect,"" or dropping of its service, in response to the price increases.
From January through March, Netflix reported it added 7.86 million paid subscribers internationally, compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.14 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said it signed up 1.74 million paid subscribers in the United States in the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of about 1.57 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Netflix is spending billions to attract new customers while Disney and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) build streaming rivals and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes gains with audiences.
""With a combined market cap of around $2.2 trillion, those three bruisers aren't to be messed with,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) equity analyst George Salmon said.
Disney is viewed as one of Netflix's strongest rivals thanks to a broad portfolio of franchises popular with children - from Mickey Mouse to Marvel and Star Wars - and a brand trusted by parents. Last week, Disney priced its service at $7 per month, just over half the $13 price for Netflix's most U.S. popular plan. The Disney+ service will launch in November.
""We don't anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth,"" Netflix said, ""because the transition from linear to on-demand entertainment is so massive and because of the different nature of our content offerings.""Disney is leading a shift among traditional media companies that had been selling programming to Netflix for years. Now, many have decided to keep their content for their own services. AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) plan to move into the streaming market. 
Netflix spent $7.5 billion on TV shows and movies for 2018, and executives have said that amount will grow in 2019. The aggressive spending has led to a tripling of the company's debt in two years, to $10.36 billion in 2018, from $3.36 billion in 2016.
For the first quarter, Netflix said its net income rose to $344.1 million, or 76 cents per share, from $290.1 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 57 cents per share.
Total revenue rose to $4.52 billion from $3.70 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $4.50 billion.
Netflix shares had closed up 3 percent in regular Nasdaq trading on Tuesday ahead of the results.

713,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. More Bank Earnings on the Way
Tech may take a hit tomorrow after  IBM  's (NYSE:IBM) revenue came in below forecasts today.
In addition, there may be trouble in FANG land after Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) warned on its second-quarter profit and also gave weaker subscriber guidance as it hikes prices in the U.S.
Tomorrow’s earnings continue to be dominated by the financial industry. No fewer than 21 financial companies will be reporting.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reports before the opening bell. The big investment bank is expected to report $1.17 a share in earnings, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, on revenue of $9.91 billion. That would be down from $1.45 a share and revenue of $11.08 billion a year ago.
The stock is up 18.6% this year after the fourth quarter’s slump of 24%.
US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) also reports ahead of trading. Analysts predict the Minneapolis-based banking company will report earnings of $1 a share, up from 96 cents a year ago. Revenue is projected at $5.6 billion, which would be up 2.2% from a year ago. The shares are up 10% so far this year.
And beverage-and-snack giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) also weights in. The company is expected to report earnings of 92 cents a share for the quarter. That would be down from 96 cents a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $12.67 billion, up from 0.9% from a year ago.
The stock is up 10.8% this year.
2. Trade Deficit Seen Widening
It seems Wall Street reacts to every talking head on trade, but tomorrow brings some hard data.
The Commerce Department will release the latest trade balance figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect that the U.S. trade deficit widened to $53.5 billion in February, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the market will get February numbers on wholesale Inventories, which are expected to rise 0.4%.
3. EIA to Spring Surprise Draw in Crude Stockpiles?
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a draw in supplies for the first time in four weeks.
The American Petroleum Institute data released Tuesday -- not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report -- showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 3.1 million barrels last week.
Oil bulls will be hoping that the EIA will spring a surprise and also report draw in crude stockpiles despite expectations for a build of 1.7 million barrels for the week ended April 12.
U.S. weekly production, which remains at a record 12.3 million barrels a day, will also attract attention amid speculation as to whether OPEC and Russia are nearing the end of their production-cut deal agreed to in December.
Crude oil futures settled 1% higher at $64.79."

The three blocks will add about 2.6 million net acres to Exxon's existing holdings in Argentina, the company said. The blocks are located in the Malvinas basin, about 200 miles (320 kms) offshore Tierra del Fuego.
Exxon's existing Argentina holdings include 315,000 net acres spread over seven blocks in the onshore Neuquén Basin of the Vaca Muerta unconventional oilfield and a business support center in Buenos Aires.
ExxonMobil will have a 70 percent stake, while Qatar Petroleum's affiliate will hold the rest.
The Argentine government issued a statement on Tuesday saying it received offers for the exploration of three offshore oil and gas basins from 13 companies for a total of $995 million. The country's energy secretariat was expected to confirm which companies were awarded which areas next month.
Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with Exxon Mobil in June to buy a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon's affiliates in Argentina, giving Qatar's state-owned entity access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country.
Exxon has been investing heavily in its U.S. shale operations and in Guyana. Its development in Argentina has been slow due to several reasons, including the geographic remoteness of the country from U.S. shale operations as well as government controls on natural gas prices.
The U.S. oil company also invested in Brazil's prolific offshore oilfields throughout 2018, clinching numerous blocks in partnership with other companies. Exxon and Qatar Petroleum International landed Brazil's Tita area, locking in key real estate in the prized Santos basin.

The two companies have also partnered on three of Exxon's offshore exploration blocks in Mozambique's Angoche and Zambezi basins.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",Russia's Deripaska ready to give up control of van maker GAZ as sanctions bite,"By Gleb Stolyarov
NIZHNY NOVGOROD, Russia (Reuters) - Germany's Daimler and some others have stopped dealing with sanctions-hit van maker GAZ, controlled by Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, he told reporters, adding he was ready to give up control of the company.
Deripaska and some of the businesses which he controls were hit by U.S. sanctions a year ago, when Washington imposed sweeping measures on some of Russia's biggest companies and business figures to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity.""
Sanctions against GAZ, Russia's biggest van maker, have not yet taken full effect due to licenses for extensions issued by Washington, but are impacting the company, Deripaska said.
""It's a tough time,"" he told reporters on Tuesday on a visit to the GAZ factory in Russia's central region of Nizhny Novgorod.
If sanctions are not lifted, he said, there was no chance GAZ would survive, even if the company is granted another extension in early July, because these extensions ""do not give you full freedom.""
A lot of suppliers and partners have stopped working with GAZ due to the risk of secondary sanctions, Deripaska said, adding there was also huge pressure on GAZ from its banks.
GAZ, which competes with a joint venture between Ford and its Russian partner Sollers among others, mainly sells its vehicles in Russia and the former Soviet Union, making it less dependent on dollar sales.
MARKET SHARE 
However, GAZ has contracts with Western partners and relies on vital supplies of foreign components. Along with Daimler, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and U.S.-based Cummins (NYSE:CMI) have contracts with GAZ.
Volkswagen, Daimler and Cummins did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment.
The company is also losing market share to rivals like Toyota and Ford, Deripaska added.
GAZ did not disclose its 2018 sales. According to the AEB lobby group, its sales of light commercial vehicles, or vans and minibuses, rose 4 percent in 2018 to 60,677.
The U.S. Treasury said in March it was extending by four months to July 6 a deadline for investors to divest from GAZ, giving Deripaska more time to lower his stake and potentially allowing the company to be removed from the U.S. sanctions list.
Washington lifted sanctions on Deripaska's main assets - aluminum maker Rusal and its parent En+ - in January after he dropped control in them. Asked if he was ready to give up control of GAZ, Deripaska said: ""Yes, as it was done in En+.""
Yet GAZ does not have such weight in global markets as Rusal and En+, so talks on any deal are slower and more difficult, sources close to GAZ previously told Reuters.
Deripaska himself remains blacklisted and is suing the United States, alleging it had overstepped its legal powers in imposing sanctions on him.

He admits his suit against Washington ""would be a difficult case"" but still hopes his name will eventually be cleared, he told reporters.

718,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>","Boeing Woes to Dent U.S. GDP in Second Quarter, Wells Fargo Says","(Bloomberg) -- The grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.’s 737 Max will cause a drag of about 0.2 percentage point on U.S. economic growth in the second quarter,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. forecast on Tuesday.
“The major negatives will be slower equipment spending and export growth during the quarter,” senior economists Tim Quinlan and Sarah House wrote in a note. “Those drags will be almost offset by an inventory boost as the undelivered aircraft test storage capacity at production facilities and unused airfields.”
Production cuts and halted deliveries of Boeing’s best-selling aircraft after two fatal crashes will ripple through components of gross domestic product and other economic indicators for months, according to the analysis, which cited industrial production, durable goods and shipments. The impact on durable goods orders “could be substantial if airlines delay new orders until safety concerns are addressed or book with a competitor,” the economists wrote.
Adjusted for the Boeing issues, Wells Fargo gave a second-quarter growth forecast of 2.5 percent, down from 2.7 percent.
It’s still not clear when global regulators will clear the Max to resume commercial flights. Chicago-based Boeing is still working on a redesign of the anti-stall system implicated in two fatal crashes. The model is the latest version of the 737, the aviation industry’s best-selling jetliner family, racking up more than 10,000 deliveries over a half century.
Halted 737 Max shipments indicate second-quarter equipment spending and exports in the “are likely to take a significant hit,” the economists said, because nearly three-quarters of the aircraft were exported last year. Reversing the stoppage will potentially boost growth in the second half, depending on when the all-clear is given, the analysts wrote.
Boeing this month cut 737 production for the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks, saying it will temporarily move to a rate of 42 per month in mid-April from an earlier pace of 52.
While work slows in Boeing’s main Seattle-area factory, much of the 737 supply chain continues to move full steam ahead at the previous production pace. Running hot allows companies like Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which builds the jet fuselages, to avoid layoffs that might further disrupt the economy.
Cancellations, not just fewer new orders, would also reduce the total value of U.S. durable goods orders, Wells Fargo said. Garuda Indonesia, flag-carrier for the nation where another airline suffered one of the crashes, threatened to cancel a $4.8 billion deal for 49 Max 8s amid passenger mistrust in the model.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX software upgrade 'operationally suitable': FAA panel,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - A review by a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration panel into Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX aircraft found a planned software update and training revisions to be ""operationally suitable,"" the agency said Tuesday, an important milestone in getting the planes back in the air.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after nearly 350 people died in two crashes, one in Indonesia in October and another in Ethiopia last month.
Boeing has been announced a planned software update on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system known as MCAS that is under scrutiny following the two disastrous nose-down crashes.
The draft report from the Flight Standardization Board (FSB) appointed by the FAA, which includes pilots, engineers and other experts, said additional training was needed for MCAS, but not required to be done in a simulator. The board said ground training ""must address system description, functionality, associated failure conditions, and flight crew alerting."" The public has until April 30 to make comments.
The panel evaluated the software update to MCAS for ""training and checking differences determination,"" the report said. ""The MCAS system was found to be operationally suitable."" 
Boeing shares closed up 1.7 percent after the news.
Boeing is under pressure to upgrade the software and convince global regulators that the plane is safe to fly again, a process expected to take at least 90 days.
Despite the stock rebound, investors were advised on Tuesday by the proxy firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis to press the company to vote for a shareholder proposal to split the role of chairman and chief executive.
ISS said uncertainty about the long-term impact on Boeing related to safety problems with the 737 MAX was serious enough to merit having an independent board chair.
""Shareholders would benefit from the most robust form of independent oversight to ensure that the company's management is able to regain the confidence of regulators, customers and other key stakeholders, ISS said in a report ahead of Boeing's annual shareholders meeting April 29.
Glass Lewis also recommended investors vote to remove from the board the head of Boeing's audit committee, Lawrence Kellner. Kellner is the former chair and chief executive of Continental Airlines.
Glass Lewis said the two crashes ""indicate a potential lapse in the board's oversight of risk management. We believe the audit committee should have taken a more proactive role in identifying the risks associated with the 737 Max 8 aircraft.""
Boeing said in a statement it ""has a strong, actively engaged board, which brings a high level of expertise, dedication and commitment to its oversight function, including with respect to the safety of the 737 MAX and our other airplane programs.""
The FAA still must approve the software package and training once Boeing formally submits them to the agency, an FAA spokesman said. 

Boeing said earlier this month it planned to submit a software upgrade and additional training for the anti-stall system known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) on the planes to the FAA in the coming weeks for approval.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.26%, the S&P 500 added 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.30%. The Nasdaq closed above 8,000 for the first time since Oct. 1.
A flurry of better-than-expected quarterly results eased investor concerns heading into the quarter that profits may have peaked.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 1% after raising full-year guidance and delivering first-quarter results that topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) also posted above-consensus earnings, but ended down 4% after management warned that Medicare for All, proposed by some Democratic lawmakers, would destabilize the health care system. UnitedHealth's decline subtracted nearly 63 points from the Dow.
The comments sparked a sharp selloff in health care stocks, pressuring the wider sector to end the day 1% lower.
The broader market was supported somewhat by financials, as banking stocks pared some of their losses from a day earlier following quarterly results from Bank of America and BlackRock.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) rose 3.3% after topping estimates from Investing.com and saw its assets under management top $6 billion after slipping below that yardstick in the previous quarter.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ended the day roughly flat as its above-consensus earnings was offset somewhat by dour guidance on interest income. Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts on a conference call that the bank anticipates its net interest income growth will be 3% in 2019, well below the 6% last year.
Beyond earnings, energy also helped Wall Street as U.S. oil prices settled 1% higher, with the conflict in Libya and falling Iranian and Venezuelan exports fueling expectations for tightening global supply.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended flat and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) surged 23% after the companies reached a truce on their years-long legal dispute over patent infringement and agreed to end all litigation.
Elsewhere in tech, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 2.2% as Sony previewed its next console, the PlayStation 5, which will include AMD's new chip and graphics hardware.
In other company news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 1.8% following reports that the Federal Aviation Administration's flight standardization board has classified the aircraft maker's anti-stall software update to its grounded 737 MAX jets as ""operationally suitable.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 inching closer to its all-time high following a string of mostly positive earnings, while a drop in healthcare shares limited the advance.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session in positive territory, with the S&P 500 hovering within a percentage of its record high reached in September.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and others posted quarterly earnings that surpassed analyst expectations.
But stock movements following the reports were mixed.
""You see different numbers and different drivers,"" said John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We've had some mixed messages from financials and healthcare."" 
With reporting season in full swing, analysts now expect first quarter S&P 500 profits to have dropped 1.8% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv data. While a solid improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first earnings decline since 2016.
Of the 42 S&P 500 companies that have posted thus far, 81% have beaten consensus, compared with the 65% average beat rate going back to 1994.
Johnson & Johnson came in above analyst estimates, mostly attributable to sales growth at its pharmaceuticals unit, driving the stock 1.1% higher.
But UnitedHealth Group, which also reported better-than-anticipated first-quarter profit and hiked its 2019 earnings forecast, fell 4.0%, likely due to regulatory worries. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.
Rivals Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) also slid, dropping 6.8% and 7.8%, respectively.
The S&P 500 Healthcare Index closed down 2.0% 
The second biggest U.S. bank by assets, Bank of America missed revenue expectations but its profit beat forecasts due to cost cutting and loan increases. Its shares edged up 0.1%. 
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, gained 3.2% after blowing past Street expectations and raking in $65 billion in new investor cash in the first quarter. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.89 points, or 0.26%, to 26,452.66, the S&P 500 gained 1.48 points, or 0.05%, to 2,907.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.21 points, or 0.3%, to 8,000.23.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven ended the session in the black.
Financials were the biggest percentage winners, rising 1.4%.
Streaming company Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) dipped in after-hours trading after it posted first quarter results.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp also fell post-market following the blue-chip tech company's earnings report.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and 41 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.57 billion shares, compared to the 6.87 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

With a ticker of YOLO -- “You Only Live Once” -- the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF will charge 74 basis points, or $7.40 for every $1,000 invested, according to regulatory documents. That’s 1 basis point less than the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, known as MJ.
“Launching 1 basis point cheaper than MJ is a bit absurd, but symbolic of the era we are in right now where expense ratio is one of the first things an adviser looks at,” said Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “This ETF has at least a fighting chance to find an audience.”
The fund is poised to make history as the first U.S. ETF to include cannabis in its name, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Issuers have struggled to start funds that directly reference marijuana, in part due to concern among custodians and other service providers over the legality of the business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also increasingly asking thematic funds to justify their names.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) will act as YOLO’s custodian, administrator and transfer agent, according to regulatory filings.
The fund plans to list in New York on Thursday, just two days shy of April 20 -- aka 4/20, pot-user slang for smoking cannabis.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>","China eyes U.S. poultry, pork imports in trade talks: sources","By Chris Prentice and Tom Polansek
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - China would likely lift a ban on U.S. poultry as part of a trade deal and may buy more pork to meet a growing supply deficit, but it is not willing to allow a prohibited growth drug used in roughly half the U.S. hog herd, two sources with knowledge of the negotiations said. 
The United States and China are trying to hammer out a deal to end a months-long trade war that has cost the world's two largest economies billions and roiled global financial markets and supply chains. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is pressing Beijing to address concerns over Chinese practices on intellectual property rights, forced technology transfer and industrial subsidies. 
Washington is also pushing for greater market access for agricultural products by seeking to reduce tariffs, lift bans and overhaul regulatory processes. The United States has asked Beijing to lift its bans on the drug ractopamine, which some U.S. pork producers use to boost hog growth, and on U.S. poultry, said two sources briefed on the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
China's negotiators have resisted lifting the ractopamine restriction even though Beijing may boost imports of U.S. pork as its own hog herd is devastated by disease, the sources said.
Huge losses in China's hog herd due to African swine fever have left the world's largest pork market facing a protein deficit, stoking hopes among U.S. pork and poultry producers. 
""I think that China will do anything possible to make it easier for them to import protein,"" said Bob Brown, an independent U.S. livestock market analyst. ""This is such a gigantic thing,"" he said of African swine fever.
Up to 200 million pigs could be culled or die from infections as the disease spreads through China, reducing the nation's pork output by 30 percent from 2019, according to Rabobank. 
Iowa State University agricultural economist Dermot Hayes said he expects China will import about 4 million to 6 million tonnes of pork in 2020, following losses in Chinese herds. The amount imported from the United States will depend on a trade deal, because Beijing maintains tariffs on shipments of American pork and has alternative suppliers, he said. 
The Chinese poultry market also ""has tremendous potential"" for U.S. producers, said Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council in Stone Mountain, Georgia, valuing it at $500 million.
""With China’s situation with African swine fever, they’re going to have a real protein shortage in the near future,"" he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects China’s total chicken imports will surge 68 percent this year to 575,000 tonnes, not including popular chicken feet, as African swine fever spurs consumers to turn to proteins other than pork. The disease is fatal to pigs but not harmful to humans.
Beijing has banned all U.S. poultry and eggs since January 2015 due to an avian influenza outbreak, which has been over for years. That caused imports to tank after the United States shipped $390 million worth of poultry and products to China in 2014. The following year, shipments were less than a fifth of that, at $74 million.
China lifted a similar restriction on poultry from France last month, and last year dropped duties on U.S. white-feathered broiler chickens. A total lifting of the ban would reopen the gates for U.S. poultry to compete in the world's largest, and best-paying, market for products like chicken feet, and benefit companies such as Sanderson Farms Inc..
While it looks increasingly likely China may lift its ban on U.S. poultry, Beijing is seeking a ""two-way street"" and would want to be able to export some poultry products to the United States as well, two sources said. 
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment. 
A U.S. meat exporter said officials from the USTR indicated that China will not drop its ban on ractopamine, though trade talks are still ongoing. 
Chinese authorities blocked the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002. They say it can cause health problems in people and is too similar to clenbuterol, an illegal additive in pig feed used to keep meat lean. The European Union also prohibits ractopamine, although the United States and other countries say it is safe. 
Keeping the ban on ractopamine could benefit companies such as Smithfield Foods, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed WH Group Ltd that already raises most of its hogs without the drug. WH Group declined to comment. Smithfield Foods did not respond to request for comment.
Other U.S. pork producers that use the drug could benefit if China dropped its ban.

""It's unfortunate news,” Christine McCracken, senior protein analyst with Rabobank in New York, said of the likely continuance of the ractopamine ban.

733,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",StockBeat - UnitedHealth Tumbles After CEO Sounds Alarm on Medicare for All,"Investing.com - UnitedHealth fell Tuesday, giving up early post-earnings gains as political concerns overshadowed solid results.
Among Democratic presidential hopefuls, ""healthcare for all"" has proved a popular narrative. Proponents of a universal Medicare plan, where people could be guaranteed coverage without using private insurance, argue that a government-led measure would iron out the administrative creases currently bedeviling the U.S. health care system. But UnitedHealth Group CEO David Wichmann warned that a Medicare for All system would destabilize the health care system and ultimately fail to expand access to care.
The measures proposed by Democrats would ""surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation’s health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best,"" Wichmann said. ""And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs -- all without fundamentally increasing access to care.""
Wichmann's remarks served as a reminder that health care will likely continue to remain a focal point and stocks will be vulnerable to negative headline risk as the 2020 presidential race heats up. In recent weeks, the sector has been pressured as lawmakers considered plans to curb drug prices.
UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) fell 5.6% even as the company delivered above-consensus earnings and raised its 2019 earnings per share guidance to $14.50 to $14.75 from $14.40 to $14.70. The earnings beat and raise led to some bullish calls from analysts on Wall Street.
But UnitedHealth's shares hit a 52-week low after the Wichmann comments and subtracted more than 80 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares are off more than 12% this year.
""We think UNH's strong growth in Q1 demonstrates its value to stakeholders across the health care system, and reinforces our view that any future reforms will still allow UNH to continue making its customers happy,"" CFRA said in a note.
Other healthcare insurers including  Community Health  (NYSE:CYH), Humana (NYSE:HUM) and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) also slumped, leaving the wider healthcare sector nursing a 1% loss."

From the outside, the imposing bell towers and outer walls, with their vast buttresses, stood firm, though the insides and the upper structure had been eviscerated.
Paris public prosecutor Remy Heitz said there was no obvious indication the fire was arson. Fifty people were working on what would be a long and complex investigation, officials said. 
One firefighter was injured but no one else was hurt, with the fire starting at around 6.30 p.m. after the building was closed to the public for the evening.

Firefighters examined the facade, with its spectacular 10-metre filigreed stained-glass rose window still intact. They could be seen walking atop the belfries as police kept the area in lockdown. 
Investigators will not be able to enter the cathedral's blackened nave until experts are satisfied its walls withstood the heat and the building is structurally sound.
The fire swiftly ripped through the cathedral's oak roof supports, where workmen had been carrying out extensive renovations to the spire's timber-framed supports. 
The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into ""involuntary destruction by fire"". Police on Tuesday began questioning the workers involved in the restoration, the prosecutor's office said.
Hundreds of stunned onlookers had lined the banks of the river Seine late into the night, reciting prayers and singing as they stood in vigil while the fire raged.
It was at Notre-Dame that Henry VI of England was crowned ""King of France"" in 1431, that Napoleon was made emperor in 1804, and Pope Pius X beatified Joan of Arc in 1909. Presidents Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterrand were mourned there.
Messages of condolence flooded in from around the world.
Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, was praying for those affected, the Vatican said, adding: ""Notre-Dame will always remain - and we have seen this in these hours - a place where believers and non-believers can come together in the most dramatic moments of French history.""
Britain's Queen Elizabeth expressed deep sadness while her son and heir Prince Charles said he was ""utterly heartbroken"". Chancellor Angela Merkel offered German help to rebuild a part of ""our common European heritage"".
VOW TO REBUILD
Considered among the finest examples of European Gothic architecture, Notre-Dame is visited by more than 13 million people a year. It sits on an island in the Seine, overlooking the Left Bank hangouts of Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso.
""Notre-Dame de Paris is the cathedral of the people, of the people of Paris, of the French people, of the people of the world. It is part of those references of our history, of what we have in common, of what we share,"" said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
The cathedral is owned by the state and has been at the center of a years-long row between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should finance restoration work to collapsed balustrades, crumbling gargoyles and cracked facades.
Within 24 hours, companies and local authorities had pledged more than 700 million euros to rebuild it, including 500 million from the three billionaire families that own France's giant luxury goods empires:  Kering  (PA:PRTP), LVMH and L'Oreal. [L5N21Y4AG]
It was too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the heritage charity Fondation du Patrimoine.
Paolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace at which the fire spread through the cathedral had been stunning. 
""We are used to thinking about them as eternal simply because they have been there for centuries, or a thousand years, but the reality is they are very fragile,"" Violini said.
(Graphic: 3D diagram of Notre-Dame - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DgH76t)
HUMAN CHAIN
The company carrying out the renovation works when the blaze broke out said it would cooperate fully with the investigation.
""All I can tell you is that at the moment the fire began none of my employees were on the site. We respected all procedures,"" Julien Le Bras, a representative of family firm Le Bras Freres.
Officials breathed a sigh of relief that many relics and artworks had been saved. At one point, firefighters, policemen and municipal workers formed a human chain to remove the treasures, including a centuries-old crown of thorns made from reeds and gold, and the tunic believed to have been worn by Saint Louis, a 13th century king of France.
""Notre-Dame was our sister, it is so sad, we are all mourning,"" said Parisian Olivier Lebib. ""I have lived with her for 40 years. Thank God that the stone structure has withstood the fire.""

738,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 01:03PM ET</span>",Netflix surges ahead of quarterly results report; Disney in focus,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 3 percent on Tuesday ahead of the streaming video service's quarterly results, with traders expecting a larger than normal reaction from the stock as new competition looms from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.
Netflix will be the first to report March-quarter earnings among major high-growth firms and Wall Street's reaction to its results will be viewed as an indicator of what to expect when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) report next week. 
""There is some concern that real competition is entering the market, but Netflix is still a good proxy for investor risk appetite, especially for technology,"" said Joel Kulina, Senior Vice President of Institutional Cash Equities at Wedbush Securities.
Options traders expect Netflix shares to swing by about 7% in either direction in the session after its report, which is expected after the market closes on Tuesday. That is more than the median move of 5.4% in Netflix's eight most recent quarterly reports, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
On Jan. 18 following its last quarterly results, Netflix dropped 4% over concerns about slowing growth, and investors are now focused on how Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings plans to fend off a major challenge from Walt Disney, with its upcoming Disney+ streaming service. 
(GRAPHIC: Walt Disney mounts a challenge to Netflix - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VN8dcL)
Disney's stock has surged 12% since it unveiled the service last week, which will be priced below Netflix and include some of the world's most popular entertainment franchises. Netflix has slipped almost 3% during that time.
""The real question that investors will want answered is how will the company launch a counterattack to Disney's massive offensive that is on the horizon?,"" Jones Trading Chief Market Strategist Mike O'Rourke wrote in a client note.
The so-called FANG group of high-growth stocks, including Facebook, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon, has rebounded sharply following a steep market selloff late last year. Facebook is up 36% year to date, followed by Netflix's 34% rise. Facebook reports on April 24, Amazon reports on April 25 and Alphabet Inc reports on April 29.
For the first quarter, Netflix has said https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/quarterly_reports/2018/q4/01/FINAL-Q4-18-Shareholder-Letter.pdf it expects to add 8.9 million global subscribers.

Analysts on average expect Netflix to report a 21.6% rise in quarterly revenue to $4.5 billion, which would be its most modest quarterly revenue increase since 2013, according to Refinitiv. Analysts on average expect non-GAAP earnings per share of 57 cents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Imperative Execution, a startup electronic stock trading venue operator, has found early success using artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce price movements after trades, and now it plans to use the technology to help brokers get larger trades done. 
Imperative Execution runs IntelligentCross, a trading platform known as an alternative trading system (ATS) that was launched in September and in the six months since has matched more than 1 billion shares. (Chart https://tmsnrt.rs/2IpCmeQ) 
To be sure, the company faces tough competition against 31 other ATSs and 13 stock exchanges like Nasdaq Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange, which together have matched around 6.5 billion shares each day this month.
What sets IntelligentCross apart is that AI is a key feature of the ATS. Founder and Chief Executive Roman Ginis said his firm uses AI to measure the outcomes of trades in real time and then adjusts trading schedules to help brokers get better executions and save their clients money. 
""We want to build venues that solve for particular trading outcomes,"" Ginis, a former trader at Cubist Systematic Strategies, the computer-driven trading arm of Steven Cohen's hedge fund Point72, said in an interview. 
The ATS currently uses an AI-assisted order type that randomly matches undisplayed orders at the midpoint of the market's best bid and offer every few milliseconds, rather than when the orders arrive. 
It then measures how much specific stock prices move and shifts the intervals between matching times to minimize price movements after the following trades.
The company says this can reduce the costs between the arrival price of an order and the execution price for completing a trade by more than one basis point, which for the entire U.S. stock market would add up to around $10 billion per year.
Jack Miller, head of trading at brokerage Baird, said his firm has had success finding buyers and sellers on IntelligentCross with a very low level of market impact.
""Innovations like this are important to us in driving best execution for our clients,"" he said.
In May, IntelligentCross is launching a new order type called the Adverse Selection Protection Engine, or ASPEN. Adverse selection refers to trading against market participants who have more information than you, potentially leaving you on the wrong side of the trade, making larger trade sizes risky.
Aspen's AI will queue up displayed orders and match them 150 microseconds to 300 microseconds apart, depending on the order size. Not matching them immediately gives brokers time to adjust their order sizes or cancel them, depending on what the market is doing in the interim.
""It is designed to allow you the time to make a decision – not a ton of time, but enough with modern technology - then you don't need to react to every single flutter of quotes on the Street,"" said Ginis.
If a broker posting a quote is not afraid of getting picked off, it will post larger quote sizes for others to trade against, he said.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 12:38PM ET</span>","Brazil offers loans to placate truckers, stays silent on diesel prices","By Ricardo Brito and Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government pledged 500 million reais ($129 million) of loans from a state bank for independent truckers on Tuesday, amid other measures designed to avoid a threatened strike, but remained silent on their underlying complaint about fuel prices.
At a news conference, presidential Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni and Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio Freitas announced the concessions to truckers angry about high diesel prices, but were mum on any possible changes to Petroleo Brasileiro SA's fuel pricing policy. 
They said a Tuesday afternoon meeting involving President Jair Bolsonaro will deal with the thornier issue of diesel pricing at Petrobras, as the state-run oil firm is known.
Bolsonaro's call to Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco last week led the company to call off a sharp diesel price increase and revived investor fears about political influence at the firm, hammering its share price.
The episode underscored the leverage of truckers in Brazil, which relies overwhelmingly on road freight to get agricultural exports to port and keep its economy humming. 
A trucker strike over high diesel prices last year paralyzed Brazil's economy for weeks, led to the departure of the then-CEO at Petrobras and handicapped an already unpopular government.
Bolsonaro, who took power in January, was one of the most prominent politicians to throw his weight behind truckers' complaints last year and has been sensitive to their demands.
In addition to the financing line for truckers from state development bank BNDES, government officials announced on Tuesday that they had earmarked 2 billion reais for the maintenance and completion of key highways.
Freitas pledged to finish paving Brazil's BR-163, a major route for transporting grains to Brazil's northern ports.
Preferred shares of Petrobras fell slightly on the Sao Paulo stock exchange during the press conference, but were still up 3.3 percent in early afternoon trade, more than a 1.7 percent rise for the benchmark Bovespa index.

Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday that the dealership in Xi'an city in the northwestern province of Shaanxi had reached an agreement with the customer and was investigating its customer service and business operations, and had suspended the franchise in the meantime.
It made no further comment about the move, which came after a video emerged on Chinese social media showing an unhappy Chinese customer protesting at a dealership, and which also prompted a critical response from regulators.
In the video, the customer complained that a car she had recently bought was leaking oil and that she was subsequently treated poorly by the dealer, highlighting poor consumer rights in the world's second largest economy. 
She also said she had paid a ""financial service fee"" of 15,000 yuan ($2,235) to an employee at the dealership when she bought the car.
China's banking and insurance regulator has asked Mercedes-Benz's car finance unit to investigate its dealership arrangements, state media said on Tuesday.
Car dealers should not be allowed to collect so-called financial services fees and should make efforts to protect customers' rights, China National Radio quoted Pang Xuefeng, an official from China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, as saying.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Tuesday reported a first-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street expectations on higher sales of its prescription medicines, including a double-digit increase for its psoriasis treatment Stelara, even as the company faces fierce competition for some of its other important drugs.
The U.S. healthcare conglomerate said growth in its pharmaceuticals business was driven by volume rather than price hikes, and its shares rose more than 2 percent to $139.49.
Sales of Stelara, which also treats Crohn's disease, jumped about 32 percent to $1.41 billion, fueling a 4 percent rise for the pharmaceutical business, which accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue. Double-digit increases for cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica also contributed to the earnings beat.
“We’re really seeing the strength in pharma sales drive top and bottom line growth,"" said John Ham, associate advisor at New England Investment and Retirement Group, which owns J&J shares. ""We think growth in pharma sales not only in Asia but also in the United States will be a driver for the company going forward.”
Excluding items, the company earned $2.10 per share, beating analysts' average estimates by 7 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
J&J also tightened its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $8.53 to $8.63 per share from its prior range of $8.50 to $8.65.
The company on a conference call said 800 sites have already been certified to treat patients with its new nasal spray depression treatment Spravato, which won U.S. approval last month.
""We believe that we're off to a very, very strong start with Spravato and that is going to be an important growth driver for us,"" said Jennifer Taubert, head of J&J's pharma unit.
Sales of prostate cancer drug Zytiga, which is now facing competition from cheaper generic versions as well as from branded rival Xtandi from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Astellas Pharma, fell 19.6 percent.
But the company said it now sees the overall sales decline it expects due to competition from generics and biosimilars in 2019 coming in at the lower end of its prior $3 billion to $3.5 billion forecast. 
Overall sales increased slightly to $20.02 billion, topping analyst estimates of $19.61 billion.
Sales from the medical device business fell 4.6 percent to $6.46 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $6.44 billion. Consumer health sales declined 2.4 percent to $3.32 billion.
Net profit for the quarter fell 14.2 percent to $3.75 billion as the company recorded $423 million in litigation expenses.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 11:42AM ET</span>","Bank of America revenue misses forecasts, shares fall","By Matt Scuffham and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) on Tuesday reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations and predicted that net interest income would rise half as fast this year, sending its shares down.
Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, followed rival domestic lenders by struggling to generate top-line growth in the latest quarter and suffering from a decline in trading revenue.
The bank's shares were down 2.7 percent in morning trade.
Lower market volatility hurt trading revenue at U.S. banks during the first quarter. That left them relying on expense cuts to drive profitability.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the country's biggest bank by assets, has been the exception. It increased revenue and beat expectations while seeing expenses rise as it invests in new technology.
Allowing for different tax treatments on some assets, Bank of America said revenue came in at $23.2 billion. That compared with the average analyst estimate of $23.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts on a conference call that the bank anticipates its net interest income will rise by 3 percent in 2019, compared with 6 percent last year.
""We've got some near-term headwinds,"" he said. 
The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown. Investors fear that could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.
The bank saw 3 percent growth in consumer loans and 4 percent growth in loans to businesses in the first quarter, allowing it to capture more revenue from higher U.S. interest rates. The company reported a 5 percent increase in deposits from a year earlier. 
Revenue rose in two of the lender's four main businesses.
Donofrio said growth in the bank's deposits and loans suggested the performance of the U.S. economy remained solid despite recession concerns. 
""Bank of America has demonstrated for years now that we can grow well in an economy that is just growing moderately,"" he told reporters on a conference call. 
Chief Executive Brian Moynihan cited demand for credit from middle-market business. He said that was ""good news for the economy overall."" 
The lender has benefited from the central bank's four rate hikes in 2018. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large deposit pool and retains rate-sensitive mortgage securities.
Net interest income - the difference between what a lender earns on loans and pays on deposits - rose 5 percent to $12.38 billion. Deposits on average also rose nearly 5 percent to $1.36 trillion.
However, the bank's trading desks, like those of its peers, have had a slow start this year because of the U.S. government shutdown and lower volatility. Changes in the U.S. tax code and concerns about a trade war spurred more trading a year ago.
Overall trading revenue declined 17 percent. Equities trading revenue fell 22 percent and fixed-income trading revenue slipped 8 percent. 
Advisory fees at Bank of America stayed flat, indicating the bank is missing out on the M&A boom lifting rival investment banks. On Monday,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) reported a 51 percent surge in advisory fees.
Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 6 percent to $6.87 billion.

Excluding one-time items, the bank earned 71 cents per share, beating the 66 cents per share analysts on average had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's markets regulator said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint alleging market manipulation in the shares of Wirecard, a payments company whose shares slumped after a Jan. 30 report in the Financial Times alleged financial wrongdoing.
A spokeswoman for regulator Bafin said the complaint, filed to the Munich Prosecutor's Office, concerned around a dozen people it suspects of market manipulation in a short-selling attack.
""We have filed a complaint to the Munich Prosecutor's Office citing suspected market manipulation in the form of a short-selling attack on Wirecard AG,"" Bafin said, adding it continued to investigate other potential market manipulation.
Bafin does not have the power to file charges in the case. The Munich prosecutor - which is already investigating FT reporter Dan McCrum - does. A spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutor confirmed receipt of the Bafin complaint but declined further comment.
A series of reports run by the FT, citing a whistleblower's claims of fraud and creative accounting at its Singapore office, wiped $10 billion off Wirecard's market value and triggered a police investigation in the Asian state.
Wirecard has denied wrongdoing, however, saying a probe conducted by Singapore law firm Rajah & Tann found no material evidence of wrongdoing by its head-office staff. It has sued the newspaper.
The online edition of news weekly Der Spiegel, which first reported the news, cited Bafin sources saying the suspicion of market manipulation did not relate to whether the FT's reporting was truthful or not.
Instead, its concerns centered on whether so-called short sellers - speculators who seek to profit from share-price declines - were tipped off about the FT's reporting ahead of publication.
In the wake of the market turmoil, Bafin slapped a two-month ban on short sales in Wirecard that is due to expire on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ban will be extended.

The FT, which has stood by its reporting, did not respond to a request for comment.

Shareholder advisory group PIRC on Tuesday recommended shareholders block RBS's remuneration report, describing chief executive Ross McEwan's overall 3.6 million pound ($4.7 million) pay packet for 2018 as ""excessive"".
PIRC said McEwan's total variable pay- at 211 percent of salary- was too high, on top of his 1 million pound base pay. Rival investor advisors Glass Lewis and ISS have recommended shareholders vote in favor of the bank's pay proposals.

The banking overhaul, proposed by the European Commission in November 2016, sets the level of cash banks must set aside to absorb losses and introduces new requirements for capital and liquidity, in line with global standards agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis.
In separate votes, lawmakers also approved on Tuesday new rules that increase the powers of EU financial supervisors, although the final law is watered-down version of the initial proposal made by the EU Commission.
The Parliament passed as well new measures that grant EU-wide protection to whistleblowers who expose corruption, tax evasion and other crimes.
Under the banking reform approved by the parliament, EU lenders will be required to hold a minimum amount of funds against risks from their lending, in a bid to increase their financial stability.
Banks will also have to meet funding requirements aimed at limiting reliance on short-term financing that contributed to the global financial crisis.

The laws approved should strengthen the EU legal framework to combat money laundering, but the changes have been criticized as being insufficient to prevent the scandals that have recently engulfed several banks in the region.

758,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 10:00AM ET</span>",Metals Trader Concord Doubles Profit Due to Aluminum Chaos,"(Bloomberg) -- Concord Resources Ltd.’s profit doubled last year as the metals trading startup benefited from the turmoil in aluminum and alumina markets following sanctions on Russian producer United Co. Rusal.
“It was a year of exceptional opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Hansen said in an interview in London. “The sanctions on Rusal created disruptions across the aluminum and alumina supply chain and we were able to execute on those opportunities outstandingly well.”
Concord, which was founded in 2015 by a group of former Noble Group Ltd. traders with private equity backing, saw net income rise to $43.4 million last year. After the U.S. sanctioned Rusal in April, alumina prices doubled to a peak of more than $700 a ton within a few weeks. Concord has a long-term contract to buy alumina from a plant in Louisiana, and last year bought a stake in the parent company of the plant, New Day Aluminum Holdings LLC.
While the company benefited from the wild ride in the aluminum market, other commodities traders and miners were hurt.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc was wrong-footed by the move in alumina, and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group also suffered.
After three years of strong expansion, Hansen said the metals trader’s growth will moderate in 2019, with fewer trading opportunities as the aluminum and alumina market stabilize following the removal of sanctions on Rusal.
The CEO said the company is exploring ways to reward its early backers -- which include Pinnacle Asset Management LP, Pala Investments AG, MKS PAMP Group and the partners of Ospraie Management LLC-- potentially via a dividend or a share buyback later this year. It’s also working on raising more capital and expanding its shareholder base.
While Concord has had informal discussions with banks about a potential initial public offering as soon as next year, Hansen indicated the focus for now is on raising funds via private deals.
“We are pursuing a plan to raise fresh capital and reward our existing holders after meeting our three-year goals, perhaps after the spring,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations and raked in $65 billion of new investor cash as global financial markets rebounded from a volatile fourth quarter.
Total assets under management grew 3% to $6.52 trillion in the quarter through March 31 from a year earlier, amid a broad-based rebound in global equity markets. Assets had dipped below $6 trillion amid market turmoil late last year.
Total quarterly net inflows across all product types jumped 13.6 percent to $64.67 billion from a year earlier.
Overall, the company sold $59 billion in stock, bond and other ""long-term"" investment funds, up from the $43.6 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
BlackRock shares were up 2.2% at $461.56 in early trading.
The U.S. economy is speeding up again after a slowdown and the market is getting ready for ""huge"" inflows into stocks, BlackRock Inc's Chief Executive Larry Fink told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""I believe people are still under-risked, despite the big rebound,"" Fink said.
The benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which sank 14 percent in the final three months of 2018, rebounded by 13 percent in the first quarter, its best performance since the third quarter of 2009.
BlackRock lost more than $26 billion in its equity portfolio during the first quarter, but this was more than offset by a jump in fixed income of nearly $80 billion. Long-term investments rose by $59 billion.
""Investment flows look stronger than we anticipated,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
""BlackRock has a really strong reputation in fixed income management and it looks like that asset class came back into favor with interest rates kind of dipping lower. I think that drove better-than-expected asset flows,"" said Sanders.
Institutional fund net inflows grew nearly nine-fold to $29.12 billion from a year ago.
Net income attributable to BlackRock fell to $1.05 billion, or $6.61 per share, in the first quarter, from $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, a year earlier. That well exceeded analysts' expectations for a profit of $6.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
BlackRock said its iShares-branded ETFs took in $30.69 billion of new money, compared with $81.40 billion in the fourth quarter.
Revenue from technology services, a key area of focus for BlackRock, grew 11 percent to $204 million.
Still, the company continued to feel the pinch from fee pressures amid an ongoing industry-wide shift from high-fee actively managed mutual funds to low-fee passive-investment products.
Base fees dropped 5% year-over-year, mainly due to the negative markets in the fourth quarter and a stronger U.S. dollar that eroded the fees they collect, BlackRock said. 

""I think it was pretty well known that fees would be down, not just for BlackRock but for any asset manager just because those are based on an average of market values throughout the quarter and we started the quarter at such a low point,"" said Edward Jones' Sanders.

Still, J&J's net earnings of $1.39 a share were down 14.2% compared to the same period last year as the conglomerate recorded litigation expenses of $423 million in the first-quarter. Last year, its net earnings were $1.60 a share.

Johnson & Johnson refuted the report's findings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a new position in KAR Auction Services, the firm's founder Jeffrey Smith said at a conference on Tuesday.
He called the company's valuation ""compelling"" at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Summit. ""We believe KAR is a tremendous opportunity,"" Smith said, adding that he thinks there is plenty of room for margin improvement and expects that portions of the business can be spun off in the near term.
Last year, KAR said it would spin out a salvaging business, allowing Starboard's investment to focus on the company's used car auctions. 
""They are not commodities, it's not easily replicable,"" Smith said. ""They are not tubes of toothpaste.""
The stock rose 6 percent in premarket trading after Smith spoke.
Smith added that the total number of cars on the road have been increasing and that vehicles have been lasting longer. 
“That’s good for the used car market,” he said. 
KAR considered going private in 2012, Reuters reported at the time. The auto auction company had been taken private once before in 2007 in a $3.7 billion deal, and then went public in 2009.
There had been confusion recently over whether or not KAR’s salvage business would be spun out.
“That led to the opportunity for us to buy a bunch of stock,” Smith said.
But KAR recently received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service deeming the spin-off as tax free and allowing the company to move forward with its plans. 
Smith also discussed the firm's position in healthcare information company Cerner Corp (NASDAQ:CERN) where the hedge fund reached a settlement and obtained board seats last week. 
Smith said that a refreshed board, commitments to buy back more shares and to reach for more aggressive targets will serve the company well. The company's stock price rose 10 percent last week when the settlement was announced.
During the first quarter of 2019, Starboard was the most active activist investment firm, starting seven new campaigns that pushed for change at companies ranging from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co to pizza chain Papa Johns.
Starboard manages roughly $5 billion in assets, according to a regulatory filing made last month.

Starboard rose to prominence by throwing out the entire board at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in 2014 and has won board seats this year at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), healthcare information company Cerner Corp. and Magellan Health.

Gig workers are usually treated as independent contractors with none of the employment rights guarantees in more regular jobs, something the companies say gives flexibility to all but which critics say often results in exploitation.
The new rules will apply to those who work a minimum of three hours per week and 12 hours per four weeks on average, including casual or short-term workers, those who work on-demand and paid trainees and apprentices.
The rights include informing workers about the working conditions such as duration and remuneration from day one.
Workers will also be able to refuse, without consequences, an assignment outside predetermined hours or be compensated if the assignment is not canceled in time.
Employers will not be allowed to hinder workers from working for other companies and will have to provide free mandatory training.
""All workers who have been in limbo will now be granted minimum rights thanks to this directive, and the European Court of Justice rulings. From now on no employer will be able to abuse the flexibility in the labor market,"" lawmaker Enrique Calvet Chambon from the ALDE liberal group, said.

EU governments, which have agreed to the rules, will have three years to enforce them.

764,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 09:22AM ET</span>","UnitedHealth beats first-quarter profit view, raises 2019 forecast","(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit above estimates and raised its 2019 earnings forecast on increased prescription volumes at its pharmacy benefits unit, sending shares of the largest U.S. health insurer up 3 percent.
The results eased some pressure on the health insurance sector where stocks have taken a beating in the past few weeks over policy-related uncertainty. Shares of rivals Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc,  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp,  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) and  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) were also up in light trading.
The uncertainty has largely resulted from proposals to change the drug-rebate system under which drugmakers refund money to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.
Analysts said the industry bellwether's quarterly results reinforce that underlying fundamentals for the sector remain fully on track, despite the recent slump in share prices.
Optum, UnitedHealth's fastest-growing unit which houses its pharmacy benefits business, brought in sales of $26.36 billion in the quarter, a jump of nearly 12 percent from a year earlier due to higher prescription volumes.
UnitedHealth on Tuesday also raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $14.50 and $14.75 per share from its prior view of $14.40 to $14.70.
""We find this notable, as UnitedHealth has historically been conservative in adjusting guidance early in the year,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said.
Last year, rivals Cigna Corp and Aetna (NYSE:AET) combined with Optum's two largest rivals, Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS).
In its health insurance business, UnitedHealth's medical care ratio, which compares premiums with the cost of delivering medical care, worsened to 82 percent, from 81.4 percent last year, on deferral of the health insurance tax, the company said. Analysts on average were expecting 82.2 percent.
In the quarter ended March 31, net earnings rose 22.2 percent to $3.47 billion, or $3.56 per share.
The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.73 per share, beating estimates of $3.60 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total revenue rose 9.3 percent to $60.31 billion, ahead of estimates of $59.71 billion.
Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said UnitedHealth continues to deliver consistent performance and fundamentals still look good. 
""But now the question is whether any rebound in the shares can be sustained amid the political overhang that has plagued the managed care group.""

UnitedHealth's shares were up 2.66 percent at $236.32 in pre-market trading. As of Monday's close, the stock is down nearly 8 percent in 2019.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",Exploding ATMs: Brazil banks wrestle with dynamite heists,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - More than two dozen heavily-armed men stormed into the center of Guararema early on a recent morning, rousing the Brazilian town's residents with the sound of broken glass, explosions - and then gunshots.
Brandishing high-powered rifles, wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying several kilos of dynamite, the gang pulled up in front of the town's main police station. It then set upon an adjoining branch of Banco do Brasil, shattering its windows and doors with crowbars.
In a coordinated 3 a.m. attack, police said, other gang members hit a  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil branch two blocks away. They detonated the dynamite in an attempt to blow up ATM machines and vaults in both banks.
Such attacks have become commonplace in Brazil: Last year, an average of two banks or ATM machines were robbed every day, mainly in small towns without a major police presence.
The spoils can be substantial.
Each ATM has four boxes storing up to 2,700 bills apiece, meaning one cash machine stuffed with 100-real bills can yield up to 1 million reais ($263,000). Bank robbers skilled with dynamite - working quickly - will often blow up several ATMs at each bank or go directly for their vaults.
To combat the robberies, Brazil's banks have invested in anti-theft technology, ranging from specialized ATMs to facial recognition cameras. When that fails or the costs become prohibitive, they have simply closed branches; as a result, some towns no longer have easy access to financial services in a country that already has a higher proportion of ""unbanked"" residents than either China or India.
The rash of bank robberies reflects just one way in which widespread violence is taking a toll on Latin America's largest economy, pushing frustrated Brazilians to elect President Jair Bolsonaro in October on a promise to crack down on crime.
""Crime seeks opportunities,"" said Rafael Alcadipani da Silveira, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank in Sao Paulo. ""In Brazil, organized crime is very strong, security in small towns is weak and bank raids seem like an easy crime to commit.""
In the Guararema bank robbery, police pursued the gang to a nearby highway, where the two sides exchanged gunfire. Eleven gang members were killed by police.
NOWHERE TO BANK
Brazil's banks, which spend $2.3 billion on security each year, have made headway against the gangs.
Bank raids fell 20 percent last year, to 758 attacks, according to news reports and police records compiled by an association of private security workers, known as Contrasp.
The tally, which has declined steadily since 2014, does not capture the rising scale of heists like the one in Guararema.
Whereas criminals once knocked over individual ATMs in the street, banks have now moved their machines into bank branches where robbers often blow open a whole row at a time — which only shows up as a single attack.
The shift in tactics illustrates how criminal gangs are adjusting to added security measures by banks, warned Leandro Vilaim, business and operation director at bank industry association Febraban.
""There is no silver bullet,"" he said. ""These measures are short-lived because attacks are always changing in nature. When banks squeeze the bandits, they find a new way out.""
Cash machines sold in Brazil, at up to 150,000 reais each, cost roughly double those in the United States.
That reflects the price of tamper-resistant technologies including explosion-resistant safes, ink that stains bills when cash machines are dynamited and an average of 10 specialized sensors to respond to attacks — all of which drives up costs.
""Brazilian ATMs are so robust that if the country was bombed in a war, only cockroaches and ATMs would be left,"" said Vilaim.
Other contermeasures include ear-piercing sirens, strobe lights and even fog machines traditionally used at night clubs, deployed to stun thieves. And Brazilian lender Itaú Unibanco Holding is investing in cameras that can identify thieves even when they use disguises.
Then there is the ultimate deterrent: shuttering a town's branch altogether – an increasingly frequent solution that is leaving a growing number of small Brazilian towns without a single bank or ATM.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VLM9z9)
Some 200 towns that had at least one branch as recently as 2016 now have none at all, according to the country's central bank. That is sometimes the result of normal cost cutting, but in many cases a direct result of multiple robberies at the same branch, according to bank executives.
Closures have left some towns with no source of cash, prompting several local prosecutors to file suits against the banks, seeking to reopen the branches.
""The main complaint in those cities comes from merchants. People don't have cash to buy stuff, so it affects the local economy,"" said Glauber Tatagiba, state prosecutor in Minas Gerais, who has filed suits against lenders.
The southeastern Brazilian town of Minduri, for example, lost its sole branch, run by Banco do Brasil, in July, forcing its 4,000 residents to travel 22 kilometers (14 miles) to São Vicente de Minas to withdraw funds.
Months later, thieves blasted the ATM in São Vicente de Minas, so customers had to head 33 km in the other direction to the nearest bank in Cruzilia, whose own branch had only recently reopened after an explosion.
""It is tough situation especially for pensioners, who have to travel to withdraw money as few merchants take cards here,"" said Minduri municipal administrator Lucas Magalhães.
ARMORED CARS AND RIFLES
What sets Brazil apart from other regions where ATMs are targeted, including parts of Europe and Africa, are the frequency of attacks, according to security experts, along with Brazilians' explosive of choice.
In other parts of the world, explosive gas is usually used to blow up ATMs. But Brazil's gangs have shown a taste for dynamite, usually stolen from mines and construction sites.
One dynamite stick strategically placed in a cash machine can send thousands of bank bills flying within seconds, ready to be bagged by waiting accomplices. Preparation, however, takes much longer, as the thieves carefully put together gangs of at least 10 people, each with their own skill set.
Gangs are equipped with high-powered military gear, often including tactical bulletproof vests, gloves, balaclavas, armored cars and .50 caliber rifles, said Pedro Ivo dos Santos, who heads the anti-bank robbery task force in São Paulo.
Even if the thieves' equipment is second-hand or stolen, he added in an interview, the price tag for such an arsenal would run around 400,000 reais. Many police departments don't have the resources to compete.
Once a gang targets an ATM, they assign specific jobs to perform during what typically amounts to a four-minute robbery. Some scatter metal road spikes to pierce the tires of police cars, for instance, while others specialize in opening the cash machines and inserting dynamite.

""ATM bombing is just the tip of the iceberg. Thieves usually start by robbing banks and later on use the proceeds to finance drug trafficking, in a move they see as career development,"" said commissioner Santos.

The Bengaluru-based company, which competes with larger rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd, said it expected first quarter revenue from its IT services business to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.09 billion. 
The lower end of that forecast translates in a drop of 1 percent sequentially, the company said.
""Although the first quarter is seasonally weak, the forecast given by the company is softer than expected,"" said Harit Shah, analyst at Reliance Securities in Mumbai. 
Shah was expecting revenue in the IT services segment to be in the range of flat to up 2 percent.
Net profit in the quarter rose to 24.84 billion rupees ($356.54 million) in the three months to March 31, from 18.03 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier.
However, the company missed analyst estimates of 25.70 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue from its mainstay IT services business grew 11.1 percent over the year, driving the Bengaluru-based company's total revenue to 150.38 billion rupees from 138.24 billion rupees last year.
Earlier in the day, Wipro said some of its employee accounts may have been hacked due to an advanced phishing campaign without revealing which clients had been affected. 
The company also said it will buy back shares worth up to 105 billion rupees. 
Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Ltd reported results on Friday, saying they expect continued strong growth in the new financial year after posting strong fourth-quarter numbers.
Wipro's shares closed down 2.4 percent at 280.9 rupees ahead of the results.

Reuters reported in February that Icahn had proposed Rodio, CEO of privately held casino gaming company Affinity Gaming, as successor to Mark Frissora, who was due to step down as Caesars CEO.
Rodio was previously CEO of Tropicana Entertainment Inc, another casino and resort operator that Icahn sold last year to peer Eldorado Resorts Inc for $1.85 billion.
Caesars on Tuesday also said it had formed a 'transaction committee' to oversee the company's ongoing efforts in ""creating additional shareholder value"".
The formation of such a committee by Caesars comes after the casino operator in March struck a deal with Icahn to appoint three new directors to its board, as the billionaire investor continued to press for a sale of the company.
Icahn has gradually built a stake in Caesars this year and, as of March 28, owned about 15 percent of the company.

Rodio will be transitioning to Caesars during the next thirty days, the company said.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has reverted to Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on issues regarding the aircraft's airworthiness and is waiting for their response, the Chinese regulator said in a statement on its website.
China was the first country to ground the newest version of Boeing's workhorse 737 model last month following a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10. 
Boeing filed an application on March 15 through the FAA to obtain an airworthiness certificate from CAAC, the Chinese regulator said in the statement that summarized remarks from a monthly briefing. 
CAAC said it had since set up a task force to review changes submitted by Boeing in accordance with a bilateral agreement between the United States and China.
The Chinese regulator did not specify the changes submitted. Boeing is planning to update the software on an anti-stall system linked to the Ethiopian Airlines crash and an earlier one of Indonesia's Lion Air but the planemaker has not yet submitted the update to FAA for approval.
CAAC is one of several regulators taking part in an FAA review panel on the 737 MAX which is expected to start this month.
The Chinese regulator said one of its pilot experts and one expert on aircraft certification would join the panel. 
CAAC said it would make sure that every 737 MAX undergoes the necessary design changes and every pilot receives the necessary training before the fleet returns to service.

Chinese airlines operated 97 of the 371 737 MAX jets in service before the grounding, the most of any country, according to Flightglobal data.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways Group Chief Financial Officer Mark Powers has stepped down after roughly a year in the job as the Abu Dhabi state-owned carrier overhauls its business after years of heavy losses.
Powers, who joined in January 2018, resigned for personal reasons and has decided to return to the United States, Etihad said in a statement confirming an earlier Reuters report.
He has been replaced in the interim by senior Etihad finance executive Adam Boukadida, the airline said on Tuesday. Etihad said it was searching for a permanent replacement. 
Etihad did not say when Powers left the airline. Boukadida has served as interim Group CFO since March, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Powers was hired as the airline embarked on a five-year turnaround plan after a strategy of buying stakes in other airlines collapsed, contributing to billions of dollars in losses.
Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas said in 2018 Powers would ""play a pivotal role in helping to guide Etihad onto the next stage of its development"".
Etihad reported a $1.28 billion loss for 2018, down from a $1.52 billion loss in 2018. It has lost $4.75 billion since 2016.
Powers, a former JetBlue CFO, was hired by Etihad following a major shake-up of management that included the departure of long-serving Group CEO James Hogan and Group CFO James Rigney.
The airline, which launched a five-year turnaround strategy in 2017, trimmed its ambitions and started reorganizing as a mid-sized carrier focused on point-to-point traffic in 2018.
This year, it canceled dozens of Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft orders worth tens of billions of dollars.

Powers headed the finances of Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) which oversees Etihad Airways, engineering, airport, travel services units, and its investments in other carriers.

Revenue edged down by $100 million from a year earlier to $23.0 billion, although earnings per share rose 13% to 70 cents, the result of over $6 billion in share buybacks over the year. The earnings result was 6% ahead of a consensus forecast of 66c, while the revenue figure missed forecasts by a whisker.
The bank's stock rose 0.2% in premarket trading in response to the news. A 10% rally over the last three weeks had led it to a seven-month high on Friday.

By contrast, higher interest rates and solid U.S. growth underpinned a 25% increase in net profit to $3.2 billion in consumer banking. The bank’s provisions against credit losses, which analysts have been watching for signs of weakness in the economy, rose by $179 million to $1 billion.

However, none of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s rivals has been able to match its first-quarter performance yet. Goldman Sachs shares fell nearly 3% on Monday after it reported a drop in revenue that was only mitigated by sharp cuts in compensation costs.

 JD Sports Fashion  Plc (LON:JD) shares have risen by 7,374 percent since Jan. 1, 2000, hitting a record on Tuesday after the retailer reported profit ahead of expectations. The stock is by far the best performer on the FTSE All-Share Index over that period, with second-placed Diploma Plc, a building components and seals maker, having returned a comparatively measly 4,200 percent. Bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair Plc is in third, up about 3,800 percent.
JD’s growth is in contrast with the U.K. retail sector’s struggles. Sales in the financial year just ended were 4.72 billion pounds ($6.2 billion), the company said Tuesday, up from about 171 million pounds in 2000. That’s been mirrored by its market value, now clearly above 5 billion pounds compared with about 60 million pounds at the turn of the century.
The retailer’s winning formula has been based around stocking exclusive ranges from the likes of Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE)., enabling it to attract growing numbers of fashion-savvy customers. It’s now extending the formula to the rest of the world, adding stores from Spain to Australia, while acquiring Finish Line Inc. in the U.S. last year.
“It’s hard to think of such an impressive showing anywhere else in retail,” Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard said in a note. He described the firm’s sales and profit growth as “stellar,” and sees no reason why it shouldn’t continue.
Shore Capital analysts Greg Lawless and Clive Black also think there’s more to come, saying the acquisition of Finish Line adds international growth potential to the equity story. This means the shares remain attractive despite the rising multiples and deserve to trade at a premium to peers, they wrote."

China's elderly care infrastructure is ill-equipped to deal with a fast graying population, expected to hit 400 million by 2035, prompting Beijing to expedite reforms and draw up policies to speed up development of the sector.
""The vitality of the elderly care sector has not been adequately stimulated. Development has been unbalanced and inadequate, while supply is insufficient and quality of service remains low,"" the State Council, or cabinet, said in a statement.
Obstacles to development of the sector must be removed, it said.
The government will cut fund-raising costs for elderly care institutions, and encourage others to raise capital through public listings and bond issues, the council said.
The government would also allow more insurance funds to invest in elderly care projects, and encourage financial institutions to extend affordable loans to elderly-care service providers, it said.
Banks, trusts and other financial institutions will be supported to help them develop financial products that can meet the long-term needs of the elderly, the council added.
That will include greater access to bank loans for the elderly and more pension-targeted mutual funds to help people invest for retirement.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The management of India's Jet Airways Ltd has proposed temporarily suspending all operations of the struggling airline, Indian media reported on Tuesday, as the company awaits promised funds from banks in a rescue deal.
Its shares fell as much as 18.3 percent to their lowest level since August 2015 following the news, as the future of the once-dominant Indian airline appeared increasingly uncertain. 
Jet Airways is likely to temporarily shut down operations, said Indian business channel CNBC TV18, citing unnamed sources. The channel said Jet's CEO has been authorized by directors at a board meeting to engage with its lenders one last time, and halt operations late Tuesday, if no funds arrive.
Separately, ET Now reported Jet's management has proposed to suspend all operations as one option at Tuesday's board meeting, or alternately continue with skeletal operations with any interim funds infused by State Bank of India (SBI), which leads Jet's consortium of lenders.
Jet Airways did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Its banks tried to calm investors and hint at a rescue of the airline that is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion in debt. 
""Lenders are committed to a revival plan for Jet Airways,"" Punjab National Bank's Managing Director Sunil Mehta told media on Tuesday. ""SBI is working on the emergency funding, everything is under discussion, nothing is finalised.""
Mehta's comments come after Jet informed all employees in a letter on Monday it was extending a suspension of international flights until Thursday due to a lack of funds.
Separately, an Indian government official told media the funding for the airline was likely to come through and that the banks were not looking to take the airline to bankruptcy court.
The airline, which over and above its bank borrowings owes money to its lessors, staff and others, has been struggling for weeks after failing to receive a stop-gap loan of about $217 million from its lenders as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.
In a bid to rescue the 25-year old carrier, Jet's lenders are attempting to bring in a new investor to buy a stake of up to 75 percent in the airline and initial expressions of interest were submitted last week.
Local media have reported that as many as six parties have submitted expressions of interest, though it is still far from clear if an acceptable bid will materialize. 
Jet currently has roughly 44 flights, and only about seven operational planes, a senior pilot with the airline and a member of the pilots' guild told Reuters on Monday.
The airline had more than 120 aircraft operating a year ago, but competition from low-cost carriers such as IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd, together with high oil prices, hefty fuel taxes and a weak rupee have lately piled on pressure.

Shares in Jet partially erased earlier losses and were down 9 percent in late afternoon trade in Mumbai on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - European shares gained for the fifth day on Tuesday, bolstered by bank and retails stocks while data out of China added to hopes of stabilization in the world's second-largest economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.2 percent by 0928 GMT led by Germany's DAX 0.6 percent rise while Spanish and Italian bourses were flat to modestly lower.
Also encouraging investors was a ZEW survey showing the mood among German investors improved in April, as the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy brightened amid a resilient global economy and a delay to Britain's departure from the EU. 
Zalando jumped more than 10 percent, making it the top performer on the STOXX and pushing the retail sector 0.7 percent higher after the e-commerce company said it expected to post an operating profit for the first quarter.
Another major boost to STOXX 600 were banks, the best performing sector this month after auto stocks.
Big Wall street banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) reported disappointing revenue estimates on Monday, sending their shares lower. Still, both lenders beat quarterly profit estimates.
""We saw a sort of a selloff in Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but if you look at the earnings, you can clearly see the earnings were really really strong,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets (UK) Ltd in London.
""This optimism is really feeding into the European banking sector as well. When they will start to announce their earnings, the expectations are high that we are going to see some good numbers coming out of the European banks after a long time.""
Italy's top bank, UniCredit SpA, gained after it and two subsidiaries agreed to pay $1.3 billion to U.S. authorities to settle investigations of violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries.
Steel pipe maker Tenaris also led gains on the pan-region index after an Argentine court reversed a decision against the company's chief executive and chairman.
Security company  G4S  (CO:G4S) gained after it reported a 4.8 percent rise in first-quarter revenue and said it had made good progress in a review to separate its cash business.
Italian utility Ascopiave rose after A2A and other utilities made a joint non-binding bid for its assets.
Lufthansa reversed early losses to edge up 0.4 percent. Germany's biggest airline posted a loss in the first-quarter hurt by rising fuel costs and overcapacity in Europe.
Hays Plc tumbled 4 percent as the British recruiter missed expectations for quarterly net fee growth below due to weakness in its biggest market, Germany.
Oil stocks including  BP  (LON:BP), Total and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) were the biggest weights on the STOXX 600, tracking declining crude prices. 
Investors breathed a sigh of relief last week after central banks in the United States and Europe maintained their dovish stance and Britain lawmakers got an extension on their country's exit from the European Union.
Signs that Sino-China trade talks are in their final stages have aided the recent buoyant mood. Closer to home, the European Trade Commissioner said late Monday that the European Union is ready to start talks on a trade agreement with the United States and aims to conclude a deal before the end of the year.

The index of STOXX 50 volatility, the main gauge of market anxiety in Europe, fell for the sixth day to touch its lowest since mid-January 2018.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>","Short European stocks still 'most crowded trade,' BAML survey shows","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Short positioning on European equities was the ""most crowded trade"" for the second straight month in April, a survey of fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) found.
Investors called bearish positions on Europe a crowded trade once again, although the market became slightly less pessimistic on the region, according to the survey, released on Tuesday. 
Allocations to euro zone equities jumped 8 percentage points month-on-month to a net neutral as some Europe bears unwound their positions, betting the trade had become overcrowded.
Trade war and a China slowdown were joint biggest tail risks, according to the survey of 187 investors with $547 billion assets under management, while growth worries dominated.
Some 66 percent of investors see a ""low growth, low inflation"" backdrop - the highest level since October 2016. 
While an inversion of the U.S. yield curve led many to predict an imminent recession, the survey found 70 percent of investors expect a global recession to start only in the second half of 2020.
A volte-face by the U.S. Federal Reserve on rate hikes helped drive stocks up this year. In the latest survey, a slim majority of investors said the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again during this cycle. 
Allocation to global bank stocks fell to the lowest level since September 2016 - a reflection of investor wariness of the sector, which suffers when interest rates stay lower for longer.
""Investors are positioned for 'secular stagnation', long assets that outperform when growth and rates fall (cash, EM, utilities), short those that require higher growth and rates (equities, eurozone, banks),"" wrote BAML strategists. 
Hedge funds, meanwhile, were chasing the equity rally. Their gross leverage - at 43 percent - and net equity exposure were both at the highest since September 2018.
UK stocks remained the surveyed investors' least favored region. Allocations held flat from last month, at 28 percent underweight as another delay to the date of Britain's exit from the European Union was announced.
""Sentiment has modestly improved from the max bearish 41 percent underweight in March 2018, but few investors own the region,"" the strategists wrote.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Poland to hold off blanket ban on Huawei 5G gear due to cost concerns,"By Anna Koper and Joanna Plucinska
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is unlikely to exclude all Huawei equipment from its next generation mobile networks, a government minister told Reuters, in part to avoid increased costs for mobile operators.
Huawei, the world's largest maker of mobile network infrastructure equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with China's government and denies U.S.-led allegations that its 5G equipment could be used for spying.
Polish officials told Reuters in January that the government was prepared to exclude China's Huawei from 5G networks in the wake of the arrest of a Chinese Huawei employee and a former Polish security official on spying allegations. 
Karol Okonski, Poland's deputy digital minister in charge of cyber security, said Warsaw is considering raising security standards and setting restrictions for fifth generation, or 5G, networks, with a decision likely in the coming weeks.
""When it comes to new investments, we are quite determined to set clear government expectations when it comes to the security of used equipment,"" Okonski said.
This would bring Poland in line with the approach of the European Commission, which late last month shunned U.S. calls to ban Huawei from 5G networks, calling instead for tougher rules.
Poland's telecommunications infrastructure relies heavily on Huawei equipment, in part because it offered lower prices than competitors. Operators are also using its gear in 5G trials.
Okonski said Warsaw is talking to operators about potential changes to existing telecom equipment, although the cost of eliminating existing Huawei equipment means the government could allow some of it to remain. 
""Poland is not able to finance the replacement of Huawei equipment by the (telecoms) operators,"" Okonski said.
COST OF BAN 
Banning Huawei would increase prices and delay the implementation of new technologies, Poland's biggest mobile operator Play has told Reuters and said it had not seen any evidence of security issues with its equipment.
Other Polish mobile operators, such as T-Mobile Polska, Orange Polska and Polkomtel, also use Huawei gear.
The U.S., one of Poland's closest allies, has for months lobbied Warsaw and other European governments to ban Huawei.
In February, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stressed the dangers of purchasing from the Chinese firm while in Poland and central Europe.
Robert Strayer, a U.S. State Department official responsible for cybersecurity, told reporters last week that the U.S. was happy with the EU's recommendation on 5G networks, which does not call for an explicit ban on Huawei's equipment. 
U.S. officials said Poland needed to ensure the security of telecommunications infrastructure if it were to increase the presence of U.S. troops on Polish soil, pushing Warsaw to institute a Huawei ban, several officials have said.
The government is keen to have more U.S. troops stationed in Poland, in part to deter potential Russian aggression. 
In September, Polish President Andrzej Duda asked President Donald Trump for a permanent U.S. military base in Poland and the countries could reach a deal guaranteeing a larger rotating presence of U.S. soldiers on Polish soil in the coming weeks.

Michal Baranowski, director of political think tank the German Marshall Fund in Warsaw, said how the United States responds will depend on whether it is willing to accept what it could view as ""an imperfect solution.""

784,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 04:46AM ET</span>",Stocks march on as European volatility vanishes,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets inched higher on Tuesday as reassuring data about the health of China's economy helped investors shrug off disappointing bank earnings in the United States, while volatility in European markets took another leg lower. 
European shares followed their Asian counterparts and opened marginally higher, leaving the Euro STOXX 600 within a whisker of eight-month highs. Germany's DAX gained half a percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 also strengthened.
The recent rally comes as a degree of calm has descended across financial markets, with European stock volatility falling to its lowest since January 2018, exacerbated by a shortened trading week for the Easter holidays.
Natixis Cross Asset Strategist Florent Pochon said investors were mainly focused on U.S. earnings, especially after the first flurry of bank results made for mixed reading. 
""After the strong rally we have seen in equities, people are now waiting for the next catalyst,"" Pochan said. ""We do expect some more positive data from Europe which should give a bit of fresh air (to European assets)"" 
The U.S.-China trade dispute, signs of slowing global corporate earnings and weaker business investment have all put pressure on riskier assets in the past year, but investors have been quick to seize on positive news.
All eyes are now on Chinese quarterly GDP data due on Wednesday. After a worrying start to the year, Chinese data have been more positive as authorities ramped up stimulus measures, soothing investor fears about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up 0.1 percent in early European trade. 
LIRA RECOVERS
Turkey's lira recovered slightly after closing at its weakest level since October on Monday. The Turkish currency was hit by data showing a surge in unemployment, a higher than expected budget deficit and tensions with the United States.
Turkey's finance minister said on Monday he had held productive meetings in Washington with international financial institutions, but that failed to much lift the currency.
By 0800 GMT, the lira had firmed 0.2 percent to around 5.79 lira per dollar.
After a rally to five-month highs this month, crude oil paused on the prospect of Russia and OPEC boosting production to fight for market share with the United States. [O/R]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate was flat at $63.46 per barrel after losing nearly 0.8 percent the previous day.
Oil has been surging on tightening global supplies, as output has fallen in Iran and Venezuela amid signs the United States will toughen sanctions on those two OPEC producers, and on the threat that renewed fighting could stop production in Libya.
Currency markets were generally quiet, although the Australian dollar took a dive lower after the Reserve Bank of Australia signaled in policy minutes that an interest rate cut would be appropriate should inflation stay low and unemployment trend higher.
The Aussie shed 0.4 percent to $0.7140.
The U.S. dollar was unchanged, its index at 96.908, while the euro and yen both rose slightly.
Many investors are now waiting on Chinese gross domestic product (GDP). A Reuters poll forecast first-quarter growth to have cooled to 6.3 percent, the weakest pace in at least 27 years, but a flurry of measures to boost domestic demand may have put a floor under slowing activity in March.
""The outlook for Asia critically hinges on the outlook of China's growth and the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks,"" wrote strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). ""On both fronts, policymakers and investors believe that the outcome of these two issues is turning more positive.""

785,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Rising fuel costs and seating surplus push Lufthansa into loss,"By Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa reported an operating loss of 336 million euros ($380 million) for the first three months of the year, hurt by rising fuel costs and excess capacity in Europe, sending its shares down on Tuesday.
Germany's biggest airline said in an after-hours update on Monday that a 202 million euro rise in fuel costs had contributed to the loss, while ticket prices fell significantly at Lufthansa's other airlines, which include SWISS and Austrian Airlines, as well as budget carrier Eurowings.
The size of the loss was far greater than analysts had expected. 
Lufthansa's stock was down 1 percent at 0925 GMT, underperforming Germany's bluechip index by around 2 percent and dragging down shares of rivals Ryanair, EasyJet and Air France KLM.
Lufthansa's loss added weight to concerns across the industry and follows a bleak report from easyJet (LON:EZJ), which said on April 1 it expected to report a 275 million pound ($360 million) loss in the six months to the end of March.
The fall in Lufthansa's earnings was accentuated by a tough comparison with the previous year when the insolvency of Air Berlin removed a major competitor in its home market, it said.
Lufthansa reported an operating profit of 52 million euros for the same period a year earlier.
European airlines are battling overcapacity and high fuel costs, while uncertainty around Brexit has led some travelers to delay booking flights for their summer holidays.
Iceland's WOW air became the latest budget airline casualty in March, halting operations and cancelling all future flights after failing to raise more funds.
Other recent failures include Britain's Flybmi, German holiday airline Germania, Nordic budget airline Primera Air and Cypriot carrier Cobalt.
The first quarter is traditionally the weakest for airlines, analysts at Independent Research said, but added that the risk of a profit warning had risen.
Lufthansa said it expects revenues to pick up in the second quarter as booking levels recover, adding that for 2019, it still expects to make an adjusted operating profit margin of 6.5-8.0 percent.
Lufthansa is due to publish detailed results for the first quarter on April 30.

The car instead will be shown at an event in the U.S. later this month, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. Still, Tesla is showcasing two Model 3 cars, a Model X and a Model S at its booth.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unveiled the Model Y last month even though Tesla won’t deliver the electric vehicles to customers for another year. A prototype of the mid-sized Model Y was roughly 10 percent bigger than the company’s best-selling Model 3 sedan.
Initially, three higher-end editions of the new vehicle will be available, with a standard version scheduled to arrive in spring 2021 for about $39,000. The company immediately began taking $2,500 pre-orders for the vehicle, a move that contributed to some analyst concerns about the company’s cash position.
Tesla’s presence in China is critical as the country tries to capitalize on the world’s largest market for EVs. The company is building a factory in Shanghai that could be partly operating by year end, a city official said last month.

788,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat - Europe at Nine-Month High on Signs of Chinese Rebound,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are rallying again on Tuesday, on increasing confidence that the world economy is coming out of a six-month slowdown, and on hopes that the EU and U.S. will avoid making their trade quarrel any more serious.
At 04:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 1.5 points, or 0.4% at 389.54, its highest level since July last year. Germany's Dax was leading the way, up 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 was up 0.3%.
Data showing a solid increase in Chinese house prices has been the immediate trigger, but they merely add to recent evidence that the world’s second-largest economy is bottoming out, responding to fiscal and monetary stimulus measures from Beijing.
Other macro issues are also helping. Markets have responded particularly brightly to the recent drip of news out of trade talks between China and the U.S., suggesting that they’re close to an agreement to remove the threat of a full-blown trade war for the foreseeable future.
EU members also last week signed off on a mandate for the European Commission in trade talks with the U.S. The talks are unlikely likely to lead anywhere in the short term, due to political resistance from France, but they may at least stop the U.S. imposing new tariffs on EU exports.
Such issues generally outweigh many of the company-specific problems punctuating this week’s news. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), for example, has hit a 10-month high this morning despite Monday’s news that German prosecutors have filed charges against former CEO Martin Winterkorn – a step that also raises questions over current board members such as Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch.
Corporate news so far Tuesday has been mixed. Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI) is up 1.0% after announcing it would pay $1.3 billion to settle U.S. allegations of violating sanctions. German online retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG)has risen over 10% after announcing better-than-expected results for the first quarter late Monday, but airlines are under pressure after Germany’s Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) warned its first-quarter loss would be wider than expected due to higher fuel costs.
French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was down 2.0% after shareholders voted to approve a buyback that will increase the stake of its biggest shareholder, Vincent Bollore. The move had been opposed by corporate governance activists who argued the step allowed Bollore to sidestep requirements on making an offer to all shareholders."

793,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 02:18AM ET</span>","Creditors to target sale of Asiana Airlines, budget arms in six months: KDB","SEOUL (Reuters) - Asiana Airlines' creditors are working on a financial support plan for the debt-laden South Korean carrier that would target a sale of the airline and its two budget affiliates over the next six months, its main creditor said.
Lee Dong-gull, chairman of Korea Development Bank (KDB), told a briefing on Tuesday that the creditors plan to a come up with a financial plan for the carrier by April 25, with a goal to sign a preliminary deal in late April or early May.
Shares of Asiana jumped by as much as nearly 30 percent to a four-year high on Tuesday, extending their recent rally.
Its top shareholder, Kumho Industrial, said on Monday that it plans to sell its entire 33.5 percent stake, worth 500 billion won ($440.08 million) at Monday's closing price, to receive creditor support. 
The creditors had earlier rejected Kumho's request to provide support of 500 billion won to the airline, forcing the conglomerate to come up with a plan to immediately sell the crown jewel to get liquidity injection.
KDB's Lee said creditors plan to provide ""enough support"" to stabilize Asiana management and regain market trust, without disclosing details.
Lee said it is ""desirable"" that Asiana should also sell its units, which include two budget carrier arms, Air Busan and Air Seoul.
He said any buyer would still only be able to pay part of Asiana's debt of more than 3 trillion won. 
Shares of SK Networks, a unit of SK Group, were up 6.6 percent on Tuesday afternoon on speculation that the conglomerate may snap up Asiana Airlines. SK Group and Hanwha Group, named as potential buyers in local media reports, have strongly denied interest.
Kumho Asiana Group, Asiana Airlines' parent conglomerate, has been reeling from its aggressive acquisition spree about a decade ago, which could see the planned sale of the flagship unit created in 1988 ahead of the Seoul Olympics. 
In an internal message, Park Sam-koo, who stepped down as Asiana Airlines' CEO late last month, said the sale was ""an inevitable decision to widely cope with difficulties"".

Chevron said the Dutch court's decision upholds rulings of two Dutch lower courts which rejected Ecuador's attempts to annul those awards.
""The Dutch supreme court found that the challenged arbitral awards are consistent with public policy and justified to prevent irreversible harm to Chevron,"" the company said.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court of Canada had dismissed claims attempting to force Chevron's Canadian unit to pay the $9.5 billion judgment handed down in Ecuador against the company over pollution in the Andean country.
Residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region have been trying to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001.
The villagers obtained a judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in 2011.

The latest decision adds to several court victories that Chevron has won against the plaintiffs and its legal team in this case.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) plans to lay off nearly 100 employees in New York in the coming months, according to a filing the bank made with New York state that was made public on Monday.
The 98 employees are being let go for ""economic"" reasons and their final day will be between May 29 and Sept. 28, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification that the bank filed with the New York State Department of Labor on Feb. 19. 
It was not immediately clear in what division of the bank the employees worked, but they have all been notified about the layoffs, according to a source familiar with the filing.
Goldman Sachs is known for an annual all-staff review in which the bank fires around 5 percent of employees for reasons like missing performance targets. The bank has said that this allows it to make new hires.
The bank employs around 36,000 people worldwide. 

Goldman Sachs reported a 13 percent slump in first-quarter revenue earlier on Monday. Declines in trading, underwriting, investment management and investing and lending revenues all contributed to the bank missing analysts' expectations.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",General Motors bets a GEM can deliver gold in developing markets,"By Nick Carey and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has spent five years re-writing its playbook for making money in Latin America and the interior of China. Now, it's show time for the first results of a project code-named GEM, for Global Emerging Market. 
At events this week ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, the No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to unveil two small SUVs that will be part of a new family of sedans and SUVs the automaker forecasts will make up one in five of its global vehicle sales by 2023.
This is just the opening salvo in a nearly $5-billion bet by GM to sell up to 2 million technology-laden, modern-looking vehicles annually to consumers who today cannot afford GM vehicles designed for the United States, but may someday as their incomes rise. 
GM has struggled for years to crack the code for growing profitably outside rich markets, in part because vehicles designed for the U.S. or China's wealthy coastal cities cost too much for developing world consumers. The company has abandoned some Southeast Asian countries and pulled back from Africa because it could not compete. 
This time around, GM says, through disciplined cost-control it has finally found a way to make affordable vehicles in bulk for emerging markets, loaded with the technology that consumers want and still make a profit. 
The Chevrolet Tracker and the Buick Encore - not be confused with its American cousin of the same name - are the first tests of a new strategy for engineering vehicles to appeal to buyers in around 40 nations of the world's middle class such as Brazil and Mexico, and the huge developing market that exists within China's heartland. 
The GEM project involved an unprecedented level of cooperation with GM's Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. GM and SAIC shared engineering costs and collaborated on purchasing, GM executives said. 
What potential customers will see are vehicles that include amenities such as touchscreens, mobile phone connectivity, rear-view cameras, and safety features like automatic emergency braking and airbags. 
What GM is counting on them not to notice is that the number of options is limited, to reduce complexity in purchasing and manufacturing, or that touches such as fully-carpeted trunks are absent. ""We may not be the absolute lowest price point in China,"" GM president Mark Reuss told Reuters at the automaker's downtown Detroit headquarters. ""But we're going to be right in that segment where this is a pretty good-sized car... (with) a huge value for what you pay for it.""
FEWER PARTS, LESS COST 
The team that set out to build GM's new vehicle family included engineers and designers from 14 different countries, meeting at the automaker's technical center in the Detroit suburb of Warren to hammer out details that were then executed in China and elsewhere, GM executives said. 
As the basic design of the GEM vehicles took shape, the strategy for where they would be sold changed. GM pulled out of some markets like India and Vietnam that were originally slated to be among the target markets. 
The challenge GEM project chief engineer Doug Houlihan faced was how to deliver low-cost vehicles that did not look cheap or lack key safety features. 
Sometimes, that meant spending more. Houlihan gave the green light to spend extra on machines that could weld on the tops of car doors rather than stamping the door in one piece. The extra investment delivered a door that fit smoothly into the roof of the car for a sleeker look.
""This gives the customer more than they would expect,"" Houlihan said.
To offset that cost, Houlihan and his colleagues dug into logistics and the supply chain.
Shipping some vehicles by sea between Brazilian ports saved money in a market where moving goods by road can be a logistics nightmare. 
Houlihan said that Brazilian logistics savings more than paid for the extra $2 per vehicle GM invested for a rear axle five times stronger than its predecessor in South America.One GM plant in Brazil took over some work on engines and bumpers that had previously been outsourced, saving $120 per vehicle - a significant figure for a low-cost vehicle.
Integrating the head-rest on the front seat for some models saved $7 per vehicle.
Chinese suppliers are key to the new GM vehicle line, but the automaker is shifting away from relying on Chinese production.
GM has tried to localize costs for these vehicles as much as possible which can help offset currency fluctuations that hit markets like Brazil. That can also mitigate the impact of tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions with China and has threatened a broad tariff on U.S. autos and parts. 
""You try and tariff-proof yourself and get it as local as you can,"" GM's Reuss said.
GM's new emerging market lineup will face plenty of competition. Chinese automakers are pushing into some of the same countries GM has targeted.
Jeff Schuster, a senior executive at auto forecaster LMC Automotive, said GM's advantage could last just a few years if rivals follow with their own low-cost models that offer modern amenities to match those in new Chevrolets and Buicks. 
Internally, a key test will be how GM applies the cost-saving strategies used in the global emerging market project to other vehicle programs. 

Houlihan has been named to lead efforts to apply the cost lessons learned from this project to GM's global lineup of crossovers for the Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Japan's big telcos jumped on Tuesday after market leader NTT Docomo announced smaller-than-feared price cuts, alleviating concerns about a profit-dampening price war.
NTT Docomo shares were up 3.5 percent in early Tokyo trading, with KDDI Corp up 5.6 percent and SoftBank Corp up 2.7 percent.
Japan's big three telcos are under government pressure to reduce carrier fees to help stimulate consumer spending in other parts of the economy. The market entry of Rakuten in October is also likely to increase price pressure.
After market close on Monday, NTT Docomo said it would cut carrier fees by as much as 40 percent. Many of its users will not see reductions of that scale and the new price plans, widely seen as complex, do not include handset fees. 
""We don't see a large negative impact on (NTT Docomo's) earnings and see a low probability of other companies responding with large price cuts,"" SMBC Nikko analyst Satoru Kikuchi wrote in a note. 
Despite the jump, shares in SoftBank Corp, which listed in December, continue to trade below their IPO price.

By contrast, shares in parent SoftBank Group Corp, which were up 1.9 percent on Tuesday morning, have in recent days been trading at a 19-year high following a share buyback and with growing expectations for the value of its investments in tech firms like Uber (NYSE:UBER) Techologies [IPO-UBER.N], which is due to list.

The sale of AT&T's 9.5 percent stake to Hulu in a cash deal gives Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, which holds a 60 percent stake in Hulu via a joint venture, more control of the company.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal has a 30 percent stake in Hulu. Based on the joint venture agreement, Disney and Comcast will decide how they want to allocate the shares bought from AT&T.
Hulu, which competes with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's Prime Video, has more than 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
Hulu's total value has risen from a reported $5.8 billion in 2016, when Time Warner - now a part of AT&T - bought the stake. Netflix at the time had a market capitalization of about $41 billion. Based on Monday's stock market closing price, Netflix is valued at $152 billion.
AT&T, which is preparing to launch its own subscription streaming video service later this year, said that its unit WarnerMedia would continue to work with Hulu to deliver content over the platform. It did not give further details. 
""WarnerMedia will remain a valued partner to Hulu for years to come as we offer customers the best of TV, live and on demand, all in one place,"" Hulu Chief Executive Officer Randy Freer said in a statement. 
AT&T said it would use the proceeds http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= from the deal to reduce debt, which stood at $176.5 billion at the end of 2018.
The company had said in November it could consider selling its stake in Hulu and review its non-core assets in 2019.
The transaction did not require any governmental or other third-party approvals and was simultaneously signed and closed, Hulu and AT&T said.
Disney last week forecast Hulu's subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and for the company to become profitable in the United States by 2023 or 2024.

SAIPAN (Reuters) - More than six months after super typhoon Yutu battered Saipan, recovery efforts are making little traction with the government facing cash-flow problems as its once vaunted engine of growth – a Chinese-funded casino project - is mired in deep losses.
Hundreds of people remain in makeshift housing and some schools are teaching students in tents on the tiny Western Pacific island, a U.S. territory close to major U.S. military bases on Guam.
Saipan's economy had been buoyed by Hong Kong-listed Imperial Pacific International Holdings' casino since it opened as a temporary facility in 2015. The project has contributed to around 60 percent of government revenues through taxes and operating fees.
However, Imperial Pacific posted a record loss in 2018 due in part to massive uncollected debts, and is far from finishing its glitzy resort that was initially due to open two years ago. 
Tax revenues due to Saipan's government have dropped by more than 70 percent, according to Imperial's annual report released in March while legislators, executives and local residents say the company is behind on monthly tax payments.
Imperial Pacific declined repeated requests for comment.
Authorities in Saipan, part of the tropical Northern Mariana Islands, are planning to cut the budget by 10 percent for 2020 and have already cut $12 million in spending for fiscal year 2019, according to governor Ralph Torres. Austerity measures such as reducing utility hours have also taken effect. 
Imperial has been granted multiple extensions after missing deadlines to complete the project and local legislator Christina Sablan said there were concerns it would need to seek a further extension because of problems securing the workforce needed to finalize construction before the current 2021 deadline. 
Labor shortages due to federal restrictions limiting the number of foreigners allowed to work in Saipan have affected businesses across the tiny island – home to around 50,000 people - where tourism is the main economic driver. 
Imperial operates its opulent gold and cream hued casino in the heart of Saipan's main Garapan district, targeting high roller gamblers, mostly from China. 
However, the planned 329-room luxury hotel - to be built on top of the casino - remains a towering construction site with cranes and scaffolding supporting the building's windowless shell. On a recent Saturday afternoon, only four of around 100 baccarat tables were occupied, while the rest of the casino lay empty and VIP sections were closed off.
The company is facing acute challenges with visits from high rollers plunging after the typhoon in October and some $1.2 billion in outstanding receivables, of which $730 million was over a year old, according to its 2018 annual report. 
Imperial is also involved in several legal cases including one brought by former construction workers who say they were victims of forced labor and human trafficking. The company declined to comment on allegations by seven Chinese former construction workers that it “recklessly disregarded its contractors’ exploitive and illegal practices”. 
Saipan's government is currently considering a bill to legalize online gambling to offset falling revenues from the casino.
Local businessman Glen Hunter said the casino's problems had spilled over into other businesses, with local parking and views affected. Hunter has repeatedly called for more transparency and scrutiny over Imperial's operations. 
""Who is going to offset these negative impacts? We the tax payers have been shouldering it,"" he said.
Imperial's casino plan is the vision of Macau junket executive Ji Xiaobo, who won a 40-year casino license in 2014.
His shift away from the former Portuguese territory, where he brought high-rolling gamblers to play, came as China's government began a corruption crackdown which pummeled Macau's casino revenues and sent wealthy betters to other locales such as Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines. 
Imperial is also trying to secure a 400-acre land plot on the north west of Saipan to build a mega resort with convention facilities and thousands of hotel rooms.
Locals like Rizalina Liwag, principal of Hopwood Middle School, are hoping the government can come up with funds to rebuild their campus, destroyed by Typhoon Yutu.
Some 900 children are currently being taught lessons out of 42 tents. 

""Our students deserve to have a permanent structure where they can enjoy and feel safe without being worried that the next typhoon may destroy our tents and we will go back to scratch again,"" she said.

804,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",China Considers U.S. Request to Shift Tariffs on Farm Goods,"(Bloomberg) -- China is considering a U.S. request to shift some tariffs on key agricultural goods to other products so the Trump administration can sell any eventual trade deal as a win for farmers ahead of the 2020 election, people familiar with the situation said.
The step would involve China moving retaliatory duties it imposed starting last July on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods to non-agricultural imports, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. The shift is because the U.S. doesn’t intend to lift its own duties on $50 billion of Chinese imports even if an agreement to resolve the trade war between the two nations is reached, one the people said.
Another person said China would consider shifting the tariffs to make it easier to meet a proposal to buy an additional $30 billion a year more of U.S. agricultural goods on top of pre-trade war levels as part of a final deal. Last July, China had levied punitive tariffs on American goods including soy, corn, wheat, cotton, rice, beef, pork and poultry in response to U.S. duties.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. China’s Commerce Ministry didn’t respond to faxed questions.
Political Costs
The bartering shows that both sides are taking political considerations into account as negotiations drag on to end the trade war, which has rattled financial markets for months. An outcome that completely removes punitive tariffs looks increasingly unlikely as Trump looks to hone his campaign message and continues to threaten the European Union, India and other countries with trade actions.
The people didn’t specify which other goods would receive higher tariffs instead of agricultural products. Other top imports included aircraft engines and parts, semiconductors, passenger cars and chemicals.
China also may take action on non-tariff barriers that have affected agricultural goods. The commerce ministry in Beijing on Monday said it would review whether to continue anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures on U.S. distillers’ dried grains, a by-product of corn ethanol production that’s used in animal feed.
Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. and China were “hopefully getting very close to the final round” and discussing whether to hold more in-person trade talks. He also said the U.S. is open to facing “repercussions” if it doesn’t live up to its commitments in a potential trade deal, a sign that the two sides are edging closer to an accord.
Under the proposed agreement, China would commit by 2025 to buy more U.S. commodities, including soybeans and energy products, and allow 100 percent foreign ownership for U.S. companies operating in China as a binding pledge that can trigger retaliation from the U.S. if left unfulfilled, people familiar with the situation said earlier this month.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>",Ageless in Japan: Suntory sells 'world whisky' blend as premium tipple,"By Ritsuko Ando and Martinne Geller
TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Suntory Holdings, faced with a whisky crunch, is selling a rare mix sourced from around the world as premium whisky, aiming to elevate the status of young blends among discerning drinkers who often swear by aged single malts.
Whisky makers globally, and in Japan in particular, have been forced to suspend some aged bottles in recent years as a surge in demand for mature whisky depleted stocks.
Last year, Suntory suspended the popular 17-year Hibiki - a glass of which Bill Murray's character in the film 'Lost in Translation' famously promoted, saying ""For relaxing times, make it Suntory time"". Now it sells online for 40,000 yen ($357) versus 10,000 yen some years ago.
In a bid to expand its options, Suntory, on Tuesday, started selling an unusual alternative, ""Ao"", a no-age statement (NAS) blend made with whisky from Scotland, the United States, Ireland, Japan and Canada.
Priced at 5,000 yen per bottle, it is a five-country blend rarely ever tried by whisky makers, but possible for Suntory given the global assets at its disposal following its $13.6 billion purchase of U.S. spirits maker Beam in 2014.
While Ao will be sold exclusively in Japan, with 30,000 dozen-bottle cases being shipped this year, it will be closely watched by rivals across the $6 billion global industry as they too grapple with dwindling supplies of premium stocks.
Unlike other hard liquor such as vodka or gin, whisky needs to be aged in barrels over anywhere between three and 50 years, meaning producers must predict demand decades in advance. As a result, many have introduced NAS whiskies to manage supply.
Global distilleries including The Macallan, owned by Edrington, The Glenlivet, owned by  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), and Diageo's Talisker have launched NAS variants in recent years. 
Pernod says its NAS Founder's Reserve has been a great success with a new generation of drinkers, becoming the sixth-biggest single malt Scotch globally in 2017 two years after it was launched, when there was a temporary shortage of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old. 
    ""Since then we have been working hard to future-proof this expression and ensure that supply is secured for the long term,"" said Miriam Eceolaza, marketing director for malts at Pernod's Chivas Brothers whisky unit, adding that Glenlivet 12 is back in some markets, such as Britain, with more to come.
Most NAS whiskies are priced modestly versus longer-aged whiskies, due in part to the industry's success at persuading drinkers that older whiskies are better. 
""It's no mystery you can charge a lot for something with a very old age statement on it, but how can you add value to younger, NAS whisky, thus making it more profitable?"" asked Chuck Cowdery, publisher of The Bourbon Country Reader. 
""If you can make a valuable product from a larger inventory pool and be successful with it, that becomes more than just a prestige project. That's something you can take to the bank."" 
PRICING
However, whisky experts say it is hard to say whether a ""world whisky"" will catch on in the premium category.
Ao's price is more than Chita, a no-age Japanese single grain, or a 10-year old Laphroaig, both owned by Suntory and available for around 3,400 yen online. 
It also costs double rival Nikka's From the Barrel, a malt and grain blend with no-age statement. 
But some observers say Ao's price does not look outrageous versus say the 63,000 yen Ichiro's Malt & Grain Maduro blend - one of the few other bottles sourced from five countries but using older whiskies matured in French oak wine barrels.
Suntory, which started in 1899 by making and selling wine, denies ""Ao"" is a result of the shortage, although its executives said they wanted to expand the range of what is available. The company is private, but its food and non-alcoholic drinks arm, Suntory Beverage & Food is listed. 
In addition to the Hibiki 17, Suntory last year halted sales of its 12-year Hakushu too, while rival Nikka, owned by Asahi Group Holdings, has also suspended aged single malts.
""It pains us that there are still limitations in supply, even though we have established increased production,"" Kengo Torii, head of the Suntory's whisky division, has said.
PROVENANCE
Ao's launch comes amid growing questions around provenance, as loose Japanese regulations have meant imported whisky, when bottled or blended in the country, can be passed off as local.
With Ao, Suntory is aiming at transparency, while showing off its global assets and blending skills.
Suntory's chief blender, Shinji Fukuyo, says he was initially wary of the assignment. 
""I couldn't at all imagine what it would taste like,"" he told Reuters ahead of the launch, adding it took multiple trials to make the ""Ao"" blend.
Whisky from Alberta Distillers in Canada is Ao's biggest constituent, followed by liquid from Jim Beam's Clermont and Booker Noe distilleries. Scotland's Ardmore and Glen Garioch, Ireland's Cooley and Japan's Yamazaki and Hakushu distilleries contribute to a lesser extent.
Some whisky aficionados will always seek an age statement for sign of quality, Bernstein's European beverages analyst Trevor Stirling said, adding that some high-quality blends, like the Johnnie Walker Blue, Green and Gold, deserve recognition.

""So there are some whisky snobs who say if it isn't single malt I'm not drinking it ... I think blended whiskies are unfairly looked down upon.""

807,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","In South Korea's struggling Kia Town, 'bad jobs' better than no jobs","By Hyunjoo Jin
GWANGJU, South Korea (Reuters) - Park Byung-kyu once led Kia Motor's union in the city of Gwangju, fighting for labor protections against the powerful, family-run chaebol that dominated the economy during South Korea's rapid industrialization.
But about 20 years ago, Park was assaulted by unionized workers wielding steel clubs after he campaigned for the rights of temporary workers at another company, leaving him paralyzed on the right side of his body. 
The attack also left him disillusioned with the approach of South Korea's forceful and often militant unions, which have faced increasing criticism for protecting their interests at the expense of other workers.
Now, Park is working for the city of Gwangju on a proposed joint venture with Hyundai Motor Co to build a new low-wage car factory, Hyundai's first new factory in South Korea in 25 years. 
The $616 million plant would create 1,000 jobs, but at less than half the wages of Hyundai's unionized workers and without many of the privileges they currently enjoy.
""The labor unions with vested interests should change. If not, their interests will be taken away,"" said the 53-year-old Park. ""Unionized labor should face up to the reality.""
The unions of Hyundai and affiliate Kia Motors, which together form the world's fifth-largest automaker by volume, have staged strikes and rallies to protest the plant.
They say it will create ""bad jobs"" and take away production and employment from existing factories.
But in a city that has seen a steady exodus of manufacturing jobs move to low-cost countries, many job seekers say they would work for the plant in a heartbeat.
Employment is a key focus for President Moon Jae-in's administration as Asia's fourth-largest economy struggles to create jobs in the face of a slowing China economy, U.S. trade protectionism and increased minimum wages.
The Moon government plans to provide financial assistance to the Gwangju plant, and also introduce similar government-business ventures in two other cities by June. 
Officials hope it will lead to a “U-turn” of Korean companies which would otherwise build factories overseas.
""This is a bold experiment to resolve jobs and labor relations problems,"" said Park Myung-joon, a senior research fellow at state-funded Korea Labour Institute, who has been involved in the project since its beginning in 2014.
The carmaking venture, the first of its kind in South Korea, is the biggest threat to date for legacy unionized auto workers, who have largely maintained high wages and benefits even with youth unemployment near a record high and the economy sluggish, Park said.
""The expensive union jobs will gradually disappear.""
POOR CITY
The proposed Hyundai factory will offer annual wages of 35 million won ($31,492) - just over a third of the average 92 million won that existing Hyundai workers earn, but higher than the average 33 million won salaried workers make in Gwangju.
Home to Kia Motor's largest domestic production facility, Gwangju is South Korea's No.2 motor city after the southeastern city of Ulsan, generating over 40 percent of its manufacturing output from the auto sector.
Like Ulsan, which has declined as Hyundai production has retreated, Gwangju's fortunes have waned as Kia's output fell to its lowest level in eight years last year.
Gwangju is now South Korea's second-poorest metropolitan city, with average monthly wages some 13 percent below the nationwide average in 2017, according to labor ministry data. 
Kim Jae-seung, who studied business management in college, said he is willing to apply for a blue-collar job at the planned plant. ""Its wage is still above the average worker's wage. In that sense, it is not a bad job. It is a good job,"" the 32-year-old Kim said at a recent job fair held at the city hall. 
Other job seekers in Gwangju interviewed by Reuters said they too were interested given high levels of unemployment among the city's younger workers. 
""There are not many quality jobs out there. Given the current economic situation, I will be thankful for the 35 million won wage,"" said Goh Chang-hoon, a 27-year-old law major.
DEFUNCT GERMAN MODEL
Park, the former union leader, first proposed the low-wage factory in 2014 and later took a leave of absence from Kia to work full-time for the city government.
Park said he borrowed the idea from Volkswagen's now-defunct low-cost division Auto 5000, which was created in 2001 to keep jobs from moving out of Germany. The project came to end in 2009, after the automaker won wage concessions from its powerful and highly paid legacy workers.
The new factory would have an annual capacity of 100,000 mini, gasoline-powered SUVs starting 2021. 
Gwangju also hopes to make electric vehicles at the plant in the future, although it has yet to be agreed with Hyundai.
James P. Rooney, an international finance professor at Sogang University in Seoul, said to be successful, the plant should make electric cars. 
“The joint venture shouldn’t be thought of a place of getting away from union and high labor cost. It should be based on the product of the future, not product of the past.""
Hyundai said it has decided to participate in the project, because the city, local community and the joint venture pledged to ""build collaborative labor relations and maintain proper wage levels"".
""Under such conditions, we believed that we would be able to secure competitiveness when we outsource mini-vehicle production to the newly created corporation,"" Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters. 
Kim Yong-gu, chief executive of Hyundai Hitech, a Gwangju-based parts supplier for Kia, is hoping the new Hyundai factory will help make up for reduced output at Kia.
Kia's Gwangju plant produced 455,252 vehicles last year, well short of its production capacity of 620,000.
“Kia can’t make the car with current labor costs,"" Kim said.
In addition to lower wages, the joint venture will break away from the union's tradition of striking almost every year during annual wage talks.
South Korea’s reputation for militant unions and rigid labor practices has long been cited as contributing to high labor costs and a persistent discount for corporate Korea. 
To make up for lower pay, Gwangju plans to build 1,100 homes as well as daycare and gym facilities in the factory complex, with the central government's help. 
WHITE ELEPHANT? 
The plan is not without its critics, who question the wisdom of adding another plant at a time when automakers are grappling with excess capacity amid sluggish domestic demand, falling exports to the United States and weak sales in China.
Auto production in South Korea is expected to fall to 3.65 million vehicles this year, just three quarters of total capacity of 4.66 million vehicles, auto unions say.
They also argue the project is politically motivated, with Gwangju long a political stronghold of Moon's liberal government.
“We have been agonizing over how to create jobs at a time when low growth and low employment have become structural issues,"" Jung Tae-ho, the presidential job secretary, said at a recent briefing.
“The project will be key to revitalizing the struggling local economy."" 
Local officials acknowledge the plan is not the panacea to all the problems Korea's manufacturing industry faces, but say it can show one path forward.

""This is not just about creating jobs in Gwangju, but about addressing Korean Inc's structural problems of low growth, low employment and high cost,"" Gwangju Mayor Lee Yong-sup told Reuters. ""Korea Inc needs a breakthrough.”

808,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>","The World's Worst Major Stock Market Is Really, Really Boring","(Bloomberg) -- Hopes of luring back global investors to a battered stock market are dimming by the day for Malaysia’s government.
The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index is down 14 percent from a record in May 2018 and it’s the worst major market in the world so far this year, having slipped 3.4 percent. That’s even amid a rally in global equities spurred by the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot and a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China. The gloomy outlook for Malaysian stocks isn’t likely to end anytime soon, says Samsung (KS:005930) Asset Management Co.
""Malaysia will likely disappoint over the next year because since the new government came in power in May 2018, it has been lowering public debt with fiscal tightening,"" said Alan Richardson, a regional fund manager at Samsung Asset in Hong Kong. ""This will be the theme from May 2018 to May 2020.""
Euphoria about Malaysian stocks has faded after almost one year since Mahathir Mohamad’s surprise election victory in May, as the new administration struggled to clean up government inefficiencies and corruption. Unfulfilled campaign promises partly due to the legacy it inherited have also hurt its popularity. The new administration last month lowered its 2019 economic growth forecast and has been on an austerity drive to rein in its budget deficit.
‘Oil Fallacy’
The stocks gauge fell to its lowest since 2016 last week even as the price of crude oil, one of its major exports, has risen by a third in 2019.
""The perception that Malaysia is the only beneficiary in Asia from rising oil prices is a fallacy,"" Richardson said. ""Rising oil price is negative for Malaysia"" because it imports more oil products than what it exports as crude, he said.
Foreign investors have dumped Malaysian shares worth more than a net $500 million so far in 2019, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Malaysia’s central bank in March pledged to keep monetary policy accommodative as global risks weigh on the trade-reliant economy.
Not everyone is bearish. Bharat Joshi, a Jakarta-based fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is “neutral” on Malaysia stocks and sees green shoots in infrastructure and oil-related stocks. Construction shares and oil and gas stocks will outperform the market following the resumption of talks on projects including the East Coast Rail Link and a rebound in commodity prices, he said.
However, Joshi and Richardson shared a view that the weak performance of the new government and companies have weighed on sentiment so far.
Richardson said he is bearish on Malaysia stocks not because there is a downside risk, but ""just that there is nothing to be positive about over the next 12 months.""

809,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",Avianca Brasil still selling tickets on routes it plans to cancel,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Struggling Brazilian airline Avianca Brasil had told regulators that it was permanently cancelling several routes as of Monday despite continuing to sell tickets for them on its website, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The airline, which has been fighting aircraft lessors in bankruptcy court, told civil aviation regulator ANAC in the letter sent on Friday that it was ending 48 flight frequencies — around a quarter of its capacity — due to a shrinking fleet.
The letter, which has not previously been reported, was the strongest sign yet of the operational impact of a bankruptcy process started in December by Brazil's fourth-largest airline.
The changes were due to take effect on Monday, according to the letter, but Avianca Brasil's website showed it was still selling tickets for several of the routes that it had told ANAC it would discontinue. 
For example, Avianca Brasil said in the letter it would end flights between international airports serving the capitals of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states but its website was still selling two daily frequencies each way as far out as March 2020. 
A representative for Avianca Brasil told Reuters the letter to ANAC was just a preliminary plan and that it was working hard to reaccomodate its flights to affect the fewest passengers possible. 
On Friday, facing the imminent repossession of nearly a third of its fleet, the airline issued a news release saying some flights would be canceled on a case-by-case basis, starting with 179 flights from Saturday to Wednesday.
On Monday, Avianca Brasil canceled an additional 150 flights from Thursday through Saturday but did not made public its plans for those routes afterwards.
Currently, the company representative said Avianca Brasil is operating a fleet of 26 planes compared to 36 just a week ago. 
ANAC said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that Avianca Brasil is required to ""broadcast broadly its canceled and altered"" flights and said that so far the agency has not registered any violations. 
ANAC has already signaled it is concerned about Avianca Brasil's ability to keep its flight schedule. 
In court documents filed late on Friday, it said there was ""a real and considerable risk that (Avianca Brasil) would not honor"" its ticket sales, affecting ""hundreds of thousands"" of travelers. 
The regulator issued a press release on Friday saying it had banned Avianca Brasil from selling tickets on ""affected routes,"" without specifying which routes or for how long.
Canceled flights entail additional costs for the struggling carrier, which has to either reimburse or re-accommodate affected passengers. In court papers, Avianca Brasil described the financial toll of canceled flights as ""brutal."" 
The airline is already running low on cash. It missed its payroll in recent weeks and several Brazilian airports now only allow its flights if they receive payment in advance.
The carrier is paying its day-to-day expenses largely with short-term loans from two of its competitors, who hope to end up with some of Avianca Brasil's airport slots — the coveted takeoff and landing rights at crowded terminals. 
The carrier's assets, consisting mainly of its slots, are expected to be auctioned in May as part of the bankruptcy process. 

LATAM Airlines Group and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes have already agreed to bid at least $70 million each for different sets of slots.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 06:03PM ET</span>",Italy's UniCredit to pay $1.3 billion to settle U.S. sanctions probe,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - Italy's top bank UniCredit SpA and two subsidiaries have agreed to pay $1.3 billion to U.S. authorities to settle probes of violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries, U.S. authorities said on Monday.
In addition, UniCredit Bank AG, the bank's German unit, agreed to plead guilty to federal and New York state criminal charges for illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of sanctioned entities, the U.S. Department of Justice and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said. 
The resolution ends a six-year investigation that has hung over the bank and follows last week's $1.1 billion settlement by London-based  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc with U.S. and British authorities over similar conduct. 
The German unit's guilty pleas are connected to violations of U.S. sanctions programs, including those related to IRISL, the state-owned Iranian shipping company sanctioned over weapons of mass destruction, authorities said. 
UniCredit's German unit went to ""great lengths"" to help the Iranian shipping company evade sanctions and access the U.S. financial system, said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski. 
Another unit, UniCredit Bank Austria AG , entered into non-prosecution agreements with federal and state authorities. 
UniCredit Bank AG, Bank Austria and their parent entity, UniCredit SpA, also agreed to resolve parallel investigations with the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the New York Department of Financial Services.
UniCredit said in a statement the penalties owed by each of the units were fully covered by provisions already made. 
The bank had booked provisions beyond the settlement and, as a result, will have 300 million euros ($339 million) after tax in additional profits in the first quarter. Its Core Tier 1 ratio - an indication of financial strength - will rise by around 8.5 basis points, it said. The bank will report first quarter results on May 9.
UniCredit said it agreed to retain an independent consultant to assess its improvements and compliance program, as part of its settlements with the Federal Reserve and the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS). 
UniCredit engaged in ""billions of dollars of transactions with clients from sanctioned nations, including Iran, Libya and Cuba, and then work(ed) to cover their tracks to avoid detection,"" acting New York Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell said.
The German bank disguised transactions between 2002 and 2011 in part by stripping words like Sudan and Tehran from payment messages to New York financial institutions, the regulator said.
The settlements relate to apparent violations of sanctions targeting proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, global terrorism and Iran, Myanmar, Cuba, Libya, Sudan and Syria, the Treasury Department said.
Ten banks other than UniCredit have been penalized by U.S. and Manhattan authorities over the past decade for sanctions-related violations. 
France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA pleaded guilty in 2014 and paid a record $8.9 billion penalty. Other banks settled with much lower penalties and deferred prosecution agreements, including Amsterdam-based ING Bank, which paid $619 million in 2012 and Zurich-based  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, which paid $536 million in 2009. 

The latest Standard Chartered settlement was on top of $667 million the bank paid U.S. authorities in 2012 and another $300 million penalty in 2014 related to surveillance shortcomings.

811,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>","U.S. airlines face too many travelers, too few planes in 737 MAX summer dilemma","By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Normally, U.S. airlines compete to sell tickets and fill seats during the peak summer travel season. But operators of the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX are facing a different problem: scarce planes and booming demand. 
The grounding of Boeing Co's fuel-efficient, single-aisle workhorse after two fatal crashes is biting into U.S. airlines' Northern Hemisphere spring and summer schedules, threatening to disarm them in their seasonal war for profits.
""The revenue is right in front of them. They can see it, but they can't meet it,"" said Mike Trevino, spokesman for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Pilots Association and an aviation industry veteran.
Southwest Airlines Co, the world's largest MAX operator, and American Airlines Group Inc with 34 and 24 MAX jetliners respectively, have removed the aircraft from their flying schedules into August. United Airlines said on Monday it would remove its 14 MAX jets through early July.
Southwest's decision will lead to 160 cancellations of some 4,200 daily flights between June 8 and Aug. 5, while American's removal through Aug. 19 means about 115 daily cancellations, or 1.5 percent of its summer flying schedule each day.
Low-cost carrier Southwest, which unlike its rivals only flies Boeing 737s, had estimated $150 million in lost revenue between Feb. 20 and March 31 alone due to MAX cancellations and other factors.
So far airlines have said it is too soon to estimate the impact of the MAX grounding beyond the first quarter, but the extended cancellations signal that they do not expect a quick return of Boeing's fast-selling jetliner. The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia. All on board both planes were killed.
Boeing is under pressure to deliver an upgrade on software that is under scrutiny in both crashes and convince global regulators that the plane is safe to fly again, a process expected to take at least 90 days.
The timing of a prolonged grounding could not be worse for Northern Hemisphere carriers. Planes run fullest during June, July and August, when airlines earn the most revenue per available seat mile, according to U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
In a letter to employees and customers on Sunday, American Airlines' top executives said they believed the MAX would be recertified ""soon"" but wanted to provide their customers reliability and confidence during ""the busiest travel period of the year."" 
American was cancelling about 90 flights per day through early June, but runs more flights and has less fleet flexibility in the peak summer travel months. 
""We're not denying that it's going to be a challenge for us,"" American spokesman Ross Feinstein said. ""That is why if we have to extend cancellations based on aircraft availability we will do so as far in advance as possible.""
A decline in seat capacity could mean higher last-minute summer fares, particularly for business class travelers, aviation consultants and analysts said. 
United has largely avoided cancellations by servicing MAX routes with larger 777 or 787 aircraft, but the airline president, Scott Kirby, warned last week that the strategy was costing it money and could not go on forever.
""We've used spare aircraft and other creative solutions to help our customers, who had been scheduled to travel on one of our 14 MAX aircraft, get where they are going. But, it's harder to make those changes at the peak of the busy summer travel season,"" United said on Monday.   
Overall the MAX represents just 5 percent of Southwest's total fleet and even less for American and United, but the strain on fleets increases as additional MAX deliveries remain frozen. 
Southwest has 41 MAX jets pending delivery for 2019, while American has 16 and United 14. They are each working with Boeing and regulators to ensure the aircraft's safety before flying it with customers and employees.
Meanwhile, operators have added a flight or two to other aircrafts' daily schedules and deferred some non-essential maintenance work. Some airlines are also weighing extending aircraft leases and bringing back idled planes, but with unclear MAX timing, no option is clear-cut or cheap, consultants said. 

United is due to publish first-quarter results on April 16, followed by Southwest on April 25 and American on April 26.

814,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Netflix, IBM, J&J and UnitedHealth to Report
The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing. Tomorrow’s reports include three Dow stocks and one of the fastest-growing media companies.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is due after the close. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the company report a profit of 57 cents a share in the quarter, down from 64 cents a year ago. But revenue is expected to rise 21% to $4.5 billion.
The video-streaming business is filling up with competitors. Disney expects to start a streaming service in November, which has depressed Netflix shares since last week. While up 30.3% for the year, Netflix shares are off nearly 18% from their 52-week high reached in June 2018.
Also after the bell,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) is expected to report $2.22 a share for the quarter, down from $2.45 a year ago. Revenue is projected at $18.5 billion, down 2.9% from a year ago. Investors may focus most closely on the performance of IBM’s cloud business. The stock is up 26% this year.
Ahead of trading, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) releases results. The health-insurance giant rose 3.1% on Monday but is down 7.6% this year on unease over calls for Medicare for all.
Analysts expect the company to report $3.59 a share for the quarter, up from $3.04 a year ago. Revenue is projected at $59.7 billion, up 8.7% from a year ago.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is expected to report $2.04 a share in earnings, down slightly from a year ago’s $2.06, with revenue slipping 1.9% to $19.62 billion. The stock is up 5.5% this year.
2. Housing, Industrial Production Data Due
While earnings season is garnering the most attention, there are still economic indicators through the week.
Tomorrow brings data on housing and industrial production.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the National Association of Home Builders issues its April housing market index.
On average, economists expect the index to edge up to 63, about the same as the past two months, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
March industrial production numbers come from the Federal Reserve at 9:15 AM ET.
Industrial production is expected to have risen 0.2% in March, with capacity utilization staying at 79.1%.
3. Will API Build Streak Continue?
Oil prices took a breather from their recent tearaway rally today on concerns about how much Russia wants to adhere to the OPEC+ production cut agreements.
Crude oil futures settled 49 cents lower at $63.40 after Russia’s finance minister touted the prospect of boosting output to protect market share.
Bears could get another hand tomorrow when the American Petroleum Institute’ snapshot of weekly U.S. oil inventories arrives, a day ahead of the official government tally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Monday, dragged down by financials as underwhelming bank earnings curbed investor enthusiasm.
But while all three major U.S. stock indexes edged lower, the S&P 500 remained within a percent of its record high.
Following a January-March rally that marked the U.S. stock market's best quarterly performance in nearly a decade, stocks had been in a holding pattern in April ahead of first quarter reporting season. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) dipped 3.8% after the investment bank's first quarter revenue came in below analyst expectations.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) posted higher-than-expected earnings as cost-cutting offset falling revenues. Its shares ended the session nominally lower, dropping 0.1%.
""We're coming off of a strong week last week,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. ""So any bad news or earnings reports this week, such as we saw with Goldman and Citigroup, is going to take away some of that momentum."" 
With first quarter reporting season shifting into high gear, analysts now see S&P 500 companies posting a 2.1% year-on-year decline in profits. While an improvement over recent estimates, it would still mark the first annual decline in earnings since 2016.
""We'll get a clearer sense as we move through the week,"" Sroka added. ""As we move into other sectors we'll get a clearer picture of corporate earnings and the economy."" 
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Co,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT), Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON), Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) are among the closely-watched earnings expected this holiday-shortened week.
Aside from earnings, ""we still have to be watchful for global geopolitical events such as the U.S.-China trade discussion,"" warned Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
Sources said U.S. negotiators have softened their demands that China curb industrial subsidies as a condition for a trade deal, marking a retreat from a core U.S. objective.
""It's a net positive,"" Stovall said. ""The president wants to get some sort of deal signed so he can move on."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, the S&P 500 lost 1.83 points, or 0.06%, to 2,905.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in the red.
Financials were the biggest percentage losers, closing down 0.6% and snapping their three-day winning streak. 
Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) rose 2.4% following its announcement that it would buy smaller rival Advanced Disposal Services Inc for about $3 billion.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co slid 1.1% after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the planemaker should fix and ""rebrand"" its 737 MAX jet.
 Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) extended its slide, falling 6.3%. The ride-hailing platform, which had its market debut in March, is now trading about 22% below its $72 offer price.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 46 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.75 billion shares, compared to the 6.91 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>","Boeing sees me as its 'piggy bank', Lion Air co-founder says","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - The co-founder of Indonesia's Lion Air, one of two airlines that lost passengers and crew in recent crashes involving the 737 MAX, has lashed out at Boeing's handling of the accidents as the potential business fallout from the jet's grounding intensifies.
Rusdi Kirana said a recent apology by Boeing (NYSE:BA) over the 346 lives lost in the two disasters, firstly at Lion Air in October and then at Ethiopian Airlines last month, stood in contrast to what he viewed as hasty earlier criticism of Lion Air's pilots.
In a telephone interview, Kirana also accused Boeing of treating him as a ""piggy bank"". Lion Air has spent tens of billions of dollars on plane orders with Boeing to become one of Asia's largest budget carriers. 
The Indonesian entrepreneur is the figurehead for what is now one of the planemaker's largest customers with 187 jets on order and 200 already delivered.
Lion Air threatened in December to axe those orders, but has given no further update. 
Boeing has embarked on a campaign following the two crashes to restore faith in its best-selling jet and pledged to remove any risk that anti-stall software, suspected of pushing the two planes downwards, could be activated by erroneous data.
In November, following an interim report on the Lion Air crash, it voiced questions over whether pilots had used correct procedures.
Kirana said the contrasting reactions demonstrated that Boeing was taking fast-growing carriers such as his for granted.
""They look down on my airline and my country even though relations are always handled in a proper way. They treat us as Third World,"" Kirana told Reuters.
""They also look down on me. They look at me as their piggy bank,"" he said in his first interview since the Ethiopian crash.
Kirana's comments - by far the strongest since the crash off Indonesia on Oct 29 - underscore the depth of a recent rift between Boeing and Lion Air, which has been balking at taking delivery of Boeing jets worth $21 billion at list prices. 
His voice also carries weight in Indonesia where he serves as the country's ambassador to Malaysia, handling relations between two Muslim-majority states with important ties.
In a statement to Reuters regarding the comments, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said: ""We remain heartbroken over the tragic loss of Lion Air Flight 610. We're sorry for the lives lost and deeply regret the devastating impact on the families, friends and colleagues of the passengers and crew.""
""Rusdi Kirana has been a leader and a pioneer in Asian aviation,"" he said, adding that Kirana and his team ""remain highly valued partners to Boeing"".
'INCONSISTENCIES'
Although safety experts have raised some questions over crew performance in both crashes, the regulatory fallout has been dominated so far by questions over MCAS anti-stall software, which Boeing has acknowledged provided a common link in the separate chains of events leading to both crashes.
Following the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a statement listing three questions relating to pilot and maintenance actions that had not been addressed in a preliminary report.
After a similar report on the Ethiopian crash, Boeing issued a sparser statement focusing on its ongoing software review. It has adopted an increasingly contrite tone as pressure grows over design decisions and its relations with U.S. regulators.
Kirana said Boeing had shown inconsistencies in its responses to the two disasters. ""(They) cast blame for the first one and apologize after the second,"" he said.
Indonesia has 236 Boeing commercial passenger planes on order and operates the AH-64 Apache (NYSE:APA) attack helicopter. 

Flag carrier Garuda joined Lion Air last month in threatening to cancel 49 MAX orders. Analysts have questioned how easily either airline can fund deliveries as competition grows and have cautioned that both face lengthy negotiations.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 03:59PM ET</span>",U.S. agency submits uranium import probe to White House,"By David Shepardson and Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has submitted to the White House the results of a national security investigation into uranium imports, a spokesman for the department said on Monday.
The ""Section 232"" probe was prompted by a petition filed by two U.S. uranium mining companies, Ur-Energy Inc and Energy Fuels Inc, complaining that subsidized foreign competitors, including Russia and Kazakhstan, have caused them to cut capacity and lay off workers.
U.S. nuclear power generators oppose the federal government taking action and have argued tariffs or quotas would increase costs for the struggling industry and possibly cause some reactors to shut.
The Commerce Department declined to discuss the recommendations because they are confidential.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in July 2018 the probe would canvass the entire U.S. uranium sector from mining through enrichment and defense and industrial consumption.
The uranium companies proposed two remedies in their petition - requiring that domestic uranium supply 25 percent of the U.S. market and a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium - approximately 12 million pounds per year.
It would revive the struggling domestic uranium mining industry, which in 2017 saw production fall to near historic lows. Current uranium prices are hovering in the mid-$20s/lb compared to highs over $140/lb in 2007.
""We believe that President Trump will recognize the danger of relying on large and increasing levels uranium imports from Russia, China and our geopolitical rivals,"" said Curtis Moore, a spokesman for Energy Fuels.
Energy Fuels and Ur-Energy are quietly preparing for a boost in both demand and prices if the Trump administration were to set a quota for uranium imports. 
Energy Fuels has recently refurbished two of its mines in Utah to be able to ramp up production if Trump sets a 25 percent quota on uranium imports or imposes tariffs.
Utility companies and environmental groups are opposed to government intervention to bolster domestic uranium mining, albeit for different reasons.
The Ad Hoc Utilities Group, a group of electric utilities with nuclear plants in their fleets including  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK), Dominion Energy Inc and Entergy (NYSE:ETR), said it will continue to make the case to the president - a supporter of nuclear energy - that the petition will saddle companies with millions in additional costs if they are forced to source domestic uranium.
""The geopolitical issues they raised have been more than adequately debunked,"" said David Tamsai, spokesman for the group. ""The petition would create a mandated market to make profits for two companies.""
Conservation groups are concerned that boosting domestic demand for uranium will put areas of land with uranium deposits - including acres within the now-redrawn Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and contested acres near the Grand Canyon in Arizona - in danger.
""There is a lot of reason to be concerned if these trade measures are taken,"" said Amber Reimondo of the Grand Canyon Trust. ""It will increase demand well beyond what current mines are capable of producing."" 

Trump has 90 days to decide whether to act upon the recommendations.

821,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",UniCredit’s German Unit Pleads Guilty in U.S. Sanctions Case,"(Bloomberg) -- A German unit of the Italian bank UniCredit SpA pleaded guilty to U.S. charges that it allowed Iranian customers to conduct transactions in violation of sanctions.
As part of its settlement with several U.S. regulators, the bank will pay $1.3 billion and its Austrian unit will enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement. The bank’s German unit, HypoVereinsbank, will also enter a guilty plea in Manhattan to a state-level charge of violating books-and-records requirements.
The penalty is several hundred million dollars more than people familiar with the matter had expected. It’s also among the largest ever related to U.S. sanctions laws. On April 9,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc agreed to pay more than $1 billion to resolve a long-running investigation into its handling of transactions related to Iran.
Over a decade beginning in 2002, the German bank moved at least $393 million through the U.S. financial system on behalf of sanctioned entities, the U.S. Justice Department said. The Austrian unit of UniCredit also conspired to circumvent U.S. restrictions on Iranians, prosecutors said.
The bank handled billions of dollars in illegal and non-transparent transactions to clients in sanctioned countries including Cuba, Iran, Libya, Myanmar and Sudan, according to New York’s Department of Financial Services, which fined UniCredit $405 million as part of the settlement. The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, the Treasury Department, the New York branch of the Federal Reserve Bank and the New York district attorney’s office also took part in the settlement.
The lender set aside 741 million euros ($838 million) in provisions and charges, including funds to settle the allegations, in the third quarter. The bank had also set aside some money for the matter earlier but declined to provide a total.
The settlement amount is covered fully by those set-asides, UniCredit said Monday in a written statement. The bank’s first-quarter earnings will be boosted by about 300 million euros after the penalty funds are released, the bank said. Its common equity tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, will improve by 8.5 basis points, it said.
UniCredit says it has implemented a “remediation and enhancement plan to strengthen its policies, procedures, supports and controls to ensure full compliance with applicable economic sanctions and internal control requirements,” it said. The bank said it would also further develop methods to prevent and detect illegal activity.
According the New York regulator, UniCredit implemented automated transaction filtering software, known as the “embargo tool,” in 2004 as part of its efforts to flag transactions that might run afoul of the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The bank’s core compliance team came up with an instructional guide designed to help the bank’s employees work around the embargo tool -- by submitting payment orders in an “OFAC-neutral” manner that wouldn’t trigger any red flags, according to the New York regulator.
“UniCredit prioritized profit over compliance and security by deliberately engaging in billions of dollars of transactions with clients from sanctioned nations, including Iran, Libya and Cuba, and then working to cover their tracks to avoid detection,” said Linda Lacewell, the acting superintendent of the New York regulator.
UniCredit Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier inherited the case when he took the helm in July 2016. HypoVereinsbank, the German unit, was subpoenaed in March 2011 by the New York district attorney’s office over transactions with certain Iranian entities.
UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, is one of several European financial institutions settling similar cases. Fifteen European banks have together paid more than $19.5 billion for violating U.S. sanctions against various countries.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA’s $8.97 billion penalty in 2014 was the largest individual fine.
The settlement is the second for an Italian bank.  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) SpA, the country’s second-biggest lender, agreed to pay $235 million in Dec. 2016 to resolve a New York regulator’s allegations that it flouted money-laundering controls for a decade.
(An earlier version of this article was corrected to remove a reference to the bank’s provisioning.)

Investing.com - Walt  Disney  hit a new high on Monday. Up 1.6% at 2:28 p.m. ET (18:29 GMT) it appears headed to a record closing high as well.
Wall Street is split on how much more Disney's (NYSE:DIS) shares will rise, even with the potential of the company's Disney+ streaming video service scheduled to start in November.
Eighteen of 23 analysts tracked by Investing.com rate the stock a buy, with just five giving the shares a neutral grade. BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield upped his rating on the stock from sell to neutral on Monday. Meanwhile, the consensus 12-month target price is $131.27, a touch lower than Monday's price.
The stock may be up 20% this year, seventh-best among the 30 Dow stocks, but 92% of the gain has come just this month and 65% came last week.
Most technical analyses of the stock say Disney is a buy. But momentum indicators suggest Friday's 10.8% run-up was too much too fast.
The 14-day relative strength index was 86 on Monday and above 75 is a sell signal.
Disney's big April run-up seems to be built on the long-term promise of Disney+. It will have many of the classic Disney shows, films and programming, the Marvel and Star Wars universes and content acquired in its recent Fox deal, plus a new stable of original programming.
Disney plans to price the service on the low side, believing customer satisfaction will be great enough that subscribers won't get turned off by price increases down the road. That's what Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) video services have shown.
Its reported earnings have been somewhat static. The consensus estimate from the analysts tracked by Investing.com is for fiscal-second-quarter earnings of $1.54 a share on revenue of just under $15 billion. The report is due May 8. A year ago, Disney reported $1.84 a share on revenue of $14.1 billion.
Meanwhile, investors in Netflix are concerned about Disney's effect on the streaming universe. As Disney soared on Friday to a record close, Netflix fell 4.5% and is off an additional 2% on Monday. It also is down nearly 19% from its 52-week high."
824,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 02:52PM ET</span>","Boeing brainstorms to regain trust in MAX, Trump urges rebranding","By Susan Heavey and Tracy Rucinski 
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday urged Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to fix and ""rebrand"" its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes, while the planemaker said it was brainstorming with airlines over other ways to win back public trust.
Pilots will play a pivotal role in that process, a Boeing spokesman told Reuters.
""Pilots' confidence in the aircraft will lead passengers and crew to have greater confidence in the aircraft,"" said Gordon Johndroe, vice president for communications at Boeing.
A person familiar with Boeing's public trust campaign said they did not believe the company was contemplating renaming the MAX, noting that aircraft renaming is a large undertaking that goes far beyond just a new paint job.
For now Boeing remains focused on submitting a software update and finalizing pilot training for regulatory approval. Regulators worldwide are preparing to review Boeing's proposals.
In an early-morning post on Twitter, Trump, who owned the Trump Shuttle airline from 1989 to 1992 and is an aviation enthusiast, weighed in with his own advice.
""What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name. No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?"" Trump tweeted.
The plane's grounding has also threatened the U.S. summer travel season, with some airlines removing the 737 from their schedules through August.
The 737 MAX is Chicago-based Boeing's fastest-selling jet and its main source of profits and cash, having won some 5,000 orders or around seven years of production for the aircraft.
Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has apologized on behalf of Boeing for lives lost in two recent accidents and promised it would address the risk that flight software meant to prevent the plane stalling could be activated by wrong data.
BRANDING STRATEGY 'PREMATURE'
Boeing has also held dozens of briefings and simulator sessions for airline executives and pilots as well as worldwide meetings with airline branding and communications staff, but Trump's tweet marks the first time the brand underpinning Boeing profits in coming years has been thrown into question at such a high level.
Brand Finance, a UK-based consultancy that tracks the value of global brands, rejected the idea that Boeing should abandon the MAX brand but said its corporate reputation was in the firing line.
""This has without a doubt damaged Boeing's reputation and we foresee a dent to the (Boeing) brand's value at over $12 billion,"" Chief Executive David Haigh said by email when asked about Trump's comments.
""This is a temporary blip in the long run for Boeing,"" he said, adding Toyota and others had recovered from similar high-profile crises without a drastic rebranding exercise.
Brand Finance had previously estimated the damage to the value of Boeing's reputation at $7.5 billion immediately after the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner, the second fatal accident involving the 737 MAX in five months.
Benjamin Hordell, founder of marketing and advertising firm DXagency, said just renaming the plane alone was not enough. Boeing should use this as an opportunity to rebrand the company by being more transparent about the steps it takes. ""People will look at it and know that it's the Boeing 737 MAX under a different name,"" he said.
""To rebrand without making sure the product is safe, and undergoing another crash with the same airplane under a new name and image could destroy Boeing,"" said Paul Caiozzo, founder and Chief Creative Officer of brand design agency Interesting Development. ""It is premature to begin to talk about rebranding a plane that has not yet been fixed.""

Boeing has the world's most valuable aerospace brand, with the value of its overall corporate image rising 61 percent to $32 billion in 2018, according to Brand Finance.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Lagging U.S. healthcare stocks could see short-term boost but clouds linger,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Second-quarter strength in U.S. healthcare stocks is almost as reliable for Americans as warming weather and the start of baseball season. This year, however, the already-lagging sector may struggle to sustain any kind of rally.
Healthcare shares are suffering from a broad market rotation favoring other groups, market-watchers say, as well as from policy-related uncertainty, although positive earnings reports in the coming weeks could provide temporary relief.
Federal government pressure to lower the cost of healthcare, and in particular prescription drug prices, for consumers continues. And as the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign heats up, that focus is likely to intensify with numerous Democratic candidates keeping it front and center, which could heighten volatility for the group's shares.
That could upend a traditional second-quarter trend. The overall market tends to be more rocky starting in the period, so investors become more defensive with their portfolios, benefiting groups such as healthcare that are seen as safer bets, according to CFRA strategists.
To some degree, healthcare is suffering from its own success. Healthcare was the best-performing major S&P 500 sector last year, when the overall stock market stumbled.
As the market rebounded this year, fueled by the Federal Reserve signal that it was not inclined to raise interest rates, optimism regarding global trade tensions and better-than-feared economic data, investors piled into laggards.
That favored sectors such as technology and industrials, while healthcare's strength last year stemmed partly from its allure as a more defensive bet.
""When the Fed shifted their stance in early January, it totally changed the backdrop,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. Investors sold healthcare stocks and ""started buying the most beat-up names,"" he said.
Earnings could provide a boost, starting on Tuesday. Results are due from diversified healthcare manufacturer Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH), the biggest and third-biggest U.S. healthcare companies by market value, respectively.
Healthcare companies in aggregate are expected to increase first-quarter earnings by 4.4% from a year earlier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That is the second-biggest rise expected of the 11 major sectors and a stand-out as earnings for the overall S&P 500 are expected to drop 2.1%.
“If the healthcare companies are reporting good earnings and the stocks continue to underperform, then you start to get some valuation support,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson.
The healthcare sector has climbed 72% of the time during the second quarter, according to CFRA, which looked at 30 years of data. That compares to 62% for the overall S&P 500, and is a higher rate than the other sectors. The healthcare sector on average has gained 3.6% in the second quarter, compared to 2.2% for the S&P 500, according to CFRA.
But the clouds that have rained on healthcare's performance so far in 2019 are not expected to dissipate soon.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 4% year to date, well below the nearly 16% gain for the overall S&P 500, as the benchmark index nears record highs.
'A BAD WEEK' 
Uncertainty over policy is particularly punishing shares of health insurers and other services companies, investors say. That includes proposals to change the drug-rebate system under which drugmakers refund money to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, and the prominence of Senator Bernie Sanders and other left-leaning presidential candidates who support ""Medicare for All"" government-run healthcare.
Last week alone, the S&P 1500 managed healthcare care index tumbled 10%, including steep drops for insurers Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc and UnitedHealth.
“It’s a bad week where all these things have kind of combined and people just want out,” Jeff Jonas, a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, said on Friday.
Shares of many large pharmaceutical and biotech companies - which comprise about half the sector - have struggled this year. Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) shares tumbled after the company's closely-watched experimental Alzheimer's disease medicine failed in clinical trials, the kind of event that analysts say scare off investors from drugmaker shares broadly.
Those stocks have largely avoided the pain doled out to services shares from drug pricing and other policy concerns, but that could change. ""I am not sure if we are done with the news flow regarding that topic,"" said Thrivent Financial healthcare analyst David Heupel. 
Shares of life-science tool and healthcare equipment companies, viewed as relatively immune from policy concerns, have outperformed their healthcare brethren this year. But they also now trade at expensive valuations compared to their five-year averages.
After selling off to end 2018, many small- and mid-cap biotech stocks have rebounded this year, making valuations less cheap than they were.
“I’d love to say that healthcare is going to claw back a lot of this underperformance,"" said Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments. 

But, he adds, political risk and his expectation that other market groups will lead ""when it’s clear that global growth is going to come, may weigh on the sector's prospects.”

828,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",Best Buy replaces turnaround chief Joly with longtime CFO,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) on Monday named Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry as the company's chief executive officer, the first woman to lead the consumer electronics retailer in its 53-year history.
Barry, who joined Best Buy in 1999 and went on to become its finance chief in 2016, will become the company's fifth CEO when she takes over from Hubert Joly, who will step aside to become executive chairman in June.
Barry along with Joly, a restructuring expert, turned around the struggling retailer that had been dogged by falling same-store sales and a takeover battle with founder Richard Schulze.
She has also held several operational roles in her tenure, including heading the integration of health services provider GreatCall Inc, which Best Buy bought last year for $800 million. 
But much credit goes to Joly who, despite lacking a retail background, was instrumental in beefing up the company's website, delivery options and tech support services making it a formidable force in a world increasingly dominated by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Under Joly, the company has also placed emphasis on membership services like its ""Geek Squad"" tech support to boost margins as the importance of matching prices with online competition becomes ever more essential to keep customers visiting its stores and website.
In Joly's near 7-year tenure as CEO, Best Buy's same store sales have risen for the past five years, while its shares have grown four-fold.
However, after announcing the move, Best Buy's shares fell as much as 1.2 percent in morning trading.
""Investors appreciate the amazing job Hubert has done for the last eight years and the downtick reflects some fear of change,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. 
Incoming CEO Barry, on a call with the media, said she would continue Best Buy's business strategy without any major shifts or leadership changes.
Joly on the call said he would continue to advise Barry on key matters such as mergers and acquisitions, as he sits right across the hall from Barry's office in Richfield, Minnesota. 
Telsey Advisory Group's analyst Joseph Feldman said, ""She is a strategic thinker who helped develop the turnaround strategy with current CEO Hubert Joly and has been at his side laying the plan for the future.""

""If ever there was a CFO suited to be CEO, it is Ms. Barry.""

When it comes to Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), investors have seemingly adopted the mantra ""when in doubt stay on the sidelines or sell."" According to financial analytics firm S3 Partners, 75% of the free float of Lyft's shares are held short, Bloomberg reported. The uncertainty over the ride-sharing company's valuation saw its shares fall as much as 6.8% on Monday, to a record low of $55.56.
Heading into a fresh trading week, reports that the company was pulling thousands of electric bikes in New York, Washington and San Francisco following complaints about stronger-than-expected braking on the front wheel have also made investors think twice about backing the stock.
Lyft is now more than 20% down from its IPO price of $72.
""We believe there could be continued pressure on Lyft shares while investors wait for Uber’s roadshow and dig further into the full financial metrics,” Wedbush Securities wrote in a note on Friday.
Uber filed its IPO prospectus last week, in which it warned that it may never turn profit and identified intense competition in the market as a risk factor, saying it may have to further lower its rates and offer greater incentives for both drivers and consumers, both of which may squeeze margins. It also reported 2018 revenue of $11.27 billion compared with Lyft’s $2.2 billion.
Lyft shares accelerated after Uber released its IPO prospectus last week, despite some analysts agreeing that it was difficult to compare the two companies as Uber boasts a far more complex model.
""And now that Uber’s S-1 was released ... we think investors don’t yet have a whole lot more clarity on some of the key comparable metrics,” Wedbush added."
832,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Treasury Market Is Driving the New Hot Trade in U.S. Equities,"(Bloomberg) -- Equity strategists on Wall Street are all rates traders now.
As earnings from America’s biggest banks continue to roll in, a macro backdrop favoring global growth and higher rates -- not the bottom-line results -- is inspiring analysts to amp up bullish calls on financial stocks and suggest caution on utilities.
Green shoots in China’s economy and signs of U.S. resilience in the first quarter have investors dialing back bets on policy easing from the Federal Reserve in 2019. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped 20 basis points from its lows of the year, putting its rate back above those of three-month bills to cure a so-called inversion. The bond market is sending a message for equity investors looking to take a stance, strategists have concluded.
On Monday,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities head of equity strategy Christopher Harvey delivered a double upgrade on diversified financials -- to overweight from underweight -- while concurrently lowering utilities to underweight from neutral.
The moves are two sides of the same coin, he notes. Diversified financials -- which includes traditional investment banks, asset managers, exchange operators, though not the biggest money-center banks -- have been battered by sinking yields and a flat curve and now look attractive. That’s in contrast to defensive-oriented yield plays like utilities, which have “already benefited from ‘low for longer,’’’ Harvey writes.
Cuts to earnings forecasts for financials leaves “a more beatable bar,” when companies report results, he points out. Only a handful of firms in this subsector have issued their first-quarter figures, but two-thirds have exceeded expectations.
A fourth-quarter global growth scare, market rout, and lingering desire for safe stocks has fostered an extreme valuation gap between financials and utilities, observes Savita Subramanian, the chief U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
“Some argue that Financials have become Utilities (regulation, cash return over growth, capped ROEs, etc.),’’ she writes. “But one key difference is the price tag.’’
The forward price-to-earnings ratio difference between utilities and financials is more than two standard deviations above its long-term average. Betting on a reversion has returned nearly 20 percent over the following year, on average, during the eight instances of such an extreme valuation gap since 1986, the strategist notes.
At the end of the first quarter, Subramanian lowered utilities to underweight from overweight, citing elevated payout ratios, stretched valuations and limited upside unless 10-year Treasury yields continued to tumble. She kept an overweight on financials.
UBS Securities head of U.S. equity strategy Keith Parker agrees that diversified financials are attractive and utilities pricey if global manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes are in the early stages of turning up.
Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co., recently rolled a bullish options bet on the financials to a higher strike price, saying that the banking group continues to benefit “from both extreme relative valuation and the prospect for an increase in rates and steepening of the yield curve.’’
He also recommends that investors buy put options on the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) that would be in the money should the ETF fall roughly 4 percent by mid-June. Downside of nearly 15 percent for the sector is possible over this stretch if investors allocate more toward riskier sectors as rates rise, he reckons.
It’s “a macro call, not an earnings call,” he concludes."
833,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>",Goldman offers fresh details on overhaul progress as revenue slides,"By Elizabeth Dilts and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) offered new tidbits about its sweeping operational overhaul when reporting first-quarter results on Monday, but investors focused on revenue declines across nearly all its main businesses, sending shares lower.
The fifth-largest bank by assets said it plans to grow retail deposits by $10 billion a year and shift more business into its banking units to lower its funding cost by one percentage point.
Top executives also explained in more detail how they plan to make Goldman Sachs more efficient by flattening internal org charts, getting rid of old technology and shifting more staff to low-cost operational hubs. They expect these steps to save another dollar of expenses for every $100 in revenue Goldman produces, and improve returns on shareholder equity by four-tenths of a percentage point.
The bank also revealed that it has been actively slashing risk-weighted assets in its fixed-income trading business since 2013, by some 40 percent so far. Goldman does not disclose the total sum of that wind-down portfolio, which is largely comprised of capital-intensive, long-dated derivatives, a person familiar with the matter said.
But those disclosures did little to ease concerns about the struggles Goldman Sachs faces as it works through its business model revamp.
On a call to discuss quarterly results, analysts peppered Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and his finance chief, Stephen Scherr, with questions about ongoing revenue weakness and requests for more information. They asked what the bank's total technology spending budget is, when its results will look more like universal banking rivals and why it is taking so long.
""You all want more quicker, and we understand that,"" Solomon said. ""But we are going to make sure we do it in the highest quality where we can.""
The bank's shares were down 3.1 percent to $201.28.
Goldman Sachs was once considered a black box of profits, disclosing little about management's goals or how core units functioned. Investors and analysts generally accepted that secrecy, since Goldman routinely generated higher returns than peers.
But regulations imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, combined with changing market trends, put some of its core businesses in peril.
The bank embarked on a plan in 2017 to generate $5 billion in additional annual revenue, partly by diving into consumer banking, where it had never previously operated. It also promised to disclose more about its progress.
The bank has doubled down on that strategy under Solomon, who started a ""front-to-back"" operational review after taking the helm in October.
Management is now putting in place the conclusions of that review, and plans to offer bank-wide performance targets early next year, Goldman said in a presentation on Monday. Investors had been expected a full report this spring.
""There's a lot of work that needs to be done at this company to reposition it for growth over the next decade,"" said David Hendler, an analyst at Viola Risk Advisors. ""Not completing the strategic review until 2020 is ridiculous. It should be done by the next quarter.""
Analysts also noted it was hard to find evidence that the overhaul was bearing fruit in the first quarter.
Declines in trading, underwriting, investment management and investing and lending all contributed to a 13 percent slump in first-quarter revenue, which missed Wall Street expectations.
One bright spot was Goldman's financial advisory business, where revenue soared 51 percent on higher deal volumes. However, the bank's backlog of deals declined, indicating revenue may be subdued in future quarters.
Total revenue of $8.81 billion missed Wall Street's $8.99 billion estimate. The biggest drop came from trading, which was hurt by lower market volatility and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown.
Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported declines in trading revenue of 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
Despite sour revenue, Goldman's profit beat Wall Street's view, which analysts attributed to a sharp drop in compensation expenses.
Earnings attributable to common shareholders fell 20 percent to $2.2 billion, or $5.71 per share, from $2.7 billion, or $6.95 per share, in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected a profit of $4.89 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Asked whether his review would result in Goldman looking more like JPMorgan, Citigroup or Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) in the next three to five years, Solomon said that was unlikely. Capital markets businesses make up 61 percent of Goldman's revenue, more than double the portion of rivals with bigger consumer and corporate banking arms. 
""I don't think you can have any expectation ... we're heading anywhere close to that direction quickly,"" he said.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 01:03PM ET</span>",Former Volkswagen CEO Winterkorn charged with fraud by German prosecutors,"By Ludwig Burger and Michelle Martin
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors charged former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud on Monday over his role in the carmaker's manipulation of diesel emissions testing, more than three years after the scandal came to light.
The German case comes nearly a year after the United States filed charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German carmaker's emissions cheating.
The prosecutors office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement that Winterkorn and four other managers faced charges. It did not give the names of the other four or say whether they were still employed by Volkswagen.
Winterkorn's lawyer, Felix Doerr, said he could not comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.
A spokesman for Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the scandal came to light and said at the time he was stunned by the scale of misconduct, did not respond to a request for comment.
Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat U.S. pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel and costing the carmaker 29 billion euros so far ($33 billion).
Volkswagen's current chief executive Herbert Diess, who only joined the carmaker in July 2015 and became CEO a year ago, said he was not among those charged. 
""I am not among the accused. I do not expect to be charged,"" Diess said, speaking on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show.
The events took place between November 2006 and September 2015, the prosecutors said, adding that Winterkorn had failed in his duty to inform European and U.S. authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated.
""Former Chief Executive Dr. Martin Winterkorn is being charged with a particularly serious case of fraud, a violation of the law against unfair competition and breach of fiduciary trust,"" the prosecutors' office said in a statement.
He also neglected to inform customers of the illegal software and did not prevent the continued installation of such software, the prosecutors alleged.
They added that this had resulted in Volkswagen being slapped with much higher fines in Germany and the United States than would have been the case had he acted.
Criminal proceedings against the carmaker over the rigged tests had already resulted in a one billion euro fine in June last year, marking one of the highest ever punitive payments imposed by German authorities against a company.
Volkswagen said it would not comment because the company was not a party to the proceedings against individuals and that the Braunschweig criminal case against the company itself had been closed.
While Winterkorn has already been charged by U.S. authorities, he remains in Germany, which does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in U.S. courts.
In a related case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Winterkorn last month, saying U.S. investors were informed too late about the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, alleging ""massive fraud"".
The Braunschweig prosecutors said people accused of particularly serious fraud could face up to 10 years in prison in Germany.
Alongside Winterkorn, four more managers were being charged on counts including major fraud and unfair competition, the statement said. 
They said that investigations into another 36 suspects in the diesel emissions scandal were ongoing and it was unclear when they would be wrapped up.

The UK overtook the United States, holder of the top spot since 2014, which was followed by Germany, China and France, according to EY, an accountancy firm which conducted the survey.
""While the UK's position may surprise some, given current uncertainty, mergers and acquisitions activity during the period since the 2016 EU referendum has remained strong,"" EY said.
Nearly three years after voters decided to take the country out of the European Union, the terms of Brexit remain unclear. The threat of a no-deal shock to the economy was averted, at least for the time being, when Prime Minister Theresa May last week secured a Brexit delay until Oct. 31.
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday to try to reassure him that Brexit should not affect Japanese investments in the country which employ hundreds of thousands of workers.
The EY survey showed China returned to the top five investment destinations for the next 12 months despite concerns about its trade war with the United States.
The United States was a top destination for nine of the 10 most active cross-border investors, including China, EY said.
The fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit referendum was not a major driver of foreign investment in Britain, it said.
""By and large, deals are driven by strategic rationale not currency movements,"" said Steve Krouskos, EY's global vice chair for transaction advisory services. 
""What hasn't changed is that the UK has great companies, great talent, great tech and great IP. These assets attract capital. Also, remember the UK isn't the only country dealing with significant geopolitical challenges.""

The biannual EY survey was based on responses from more than 2,900 senior executives from around the world.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Spotify prompts Nordic pension funds to add private equity to playlists,"By Esha Vaish and Simon Jessop
STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - A vibrant start-up scene, which has spawned stars such as Spotify, Skype and Rovio, is inspiring Nordic pension funds to invest more money with local private equity funds.
Managers looking to pump up their pension returns hope that this will plug them into the Nordic business world's inner circle and help them to back the best prospects early on.
""With Spotify we got a call that maybe there were some shares for sale ... We thought it was a great product so we said let's dig into this and we made an acquisition with our friends at AMF,"" Bo Selling, Alecta's head of equities, told Reuters.
Swedish pension funds Alecta and AMF saw their 2016 investments in Spotify nearly triple in value when it listed in 2018. This success has helped fuel demand from other pension funds and encouraged some to change their investment parameters in order to be able to seek out the region's next big hit.
As part of this shift, Sweden said earlier this year it will allow some of its largest state public pension funds, named APs 1, 2, 3 and 4, to allocate up to 40 percent of the about $140 billion they manage to illiquid investments, removing a 5 percent limit for unlisted instruments.
""We will most likely do more investments in private equity and venture (capital),"" said Jenny Askfelt Rudd, head of alternative investments at AP4, which has about 3 percent of its assets in private equity.
Around a quarter of all assets raised in Europe so far in 2019 have gone to funds based in the Nordics, data from industry tracker Preqin showed, part of a global surge in demand that has seen total undeployed capital in the sector pass $2 trillion.
This is driven by institutional investors looking to shore up returns as global economic uncertainty roiled stock markets.
But it is not all one-way traffic. Last year, Norway's government recommended against allowing its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to expand into private equity.
The ball is now in the hands of the country's parliament, with the fund arguing the move could help improve its balance between risk and return, and naming Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb among missed opportunities due to the current restrictions.

Norway's sovereign fund posted a negative return on investment of 6.1 percent in 2018, while AP4 posted its second negative result since 2008 last year and warned it faced significant challenges in delivering returns at levels achieved in the past decade.
A Swedish parliamentary committee that worked on the pension rule changes found that where listed equities generated returns of an average 6.9 percent, alternative investments have delivered a combined 12.3 percent.
Denmark's PFA, which runs 75 billion euros ($85 billion) in assets, is already active, growing its alternatives investments from 1 billion euros in late 2015 to 5 billion euros now.
""We have an ambition to grow that significantly over the coming years,"" Peter Tind Larsen, head of alternative investments at PFA, said.
Despite concerns that demand is fuelling a valuation bubble, Selling said Alecta believes there are still opportunities to grow its private equity portfolio, with just 0.5 percent of its 860 billion Swedish crowns ($93 billion) in assets in unlisted equities.
""A good company with a good model and good growth prospects can be deemed interesting even if it is priced at a higher multiple on the earnings,"" Selling said. 
GET WITH THE PROGRAMMERS
On the flipside, private equity firms are seeking partnerships with pension funds to bump up the valuation of assets without having to seek a market listing, bankers say.
Independent Vetcare (IVC), Europe's largest veterinary services firm, was valued at 3 billion euros when Alecta and AP6 - a specialist in unlisted investments - bought 20 percent in February versus the roughly 500 million euros EQT paid to buy it in 2016, sources told Reuters.
So far in 2019, five Nordic-based funds have raised a combined 4.2 billion euros in assets, 22 percent of the total for Europe as a whole, Preqin data showed. That compares with 16 percent last year and 6 percent in 2017. 
For an interactive version of the graphics, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2VMu8jZ and here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Xeeaja.
EQT is the local sector leader and has seven of the ten biggest funds raised in the region, including EQT VIII, which last year raised 10.8 billion euros. Others include Nordic Capital, Altor, IK Investment Partners, Creandum and Northzone.
Much of their focus is on the region's vibrant digital start-up scene. The European Digital City Index ranks Stockholm second to London in terms of support for digital entrepreneurs. Helsinki and Copenhagen also make the top ten.
""Being a programmer is the most common job in Stockholm, so it's everywhere,"" Ted Persson, operating partner at EQT Ventures, said.
Swedish payments company Klarna is seen by bankers as one of the hottest local firms to invest in ahead of a likely IPO, and pension funds seem primed to take a slice in its external fundraising this year.
Valued by bankers with knowledge of its recent internal fundraising at around 32 billion Swedish crowns, the firm counts private equity firms Sequoia and Permira, as well as rapper Snoop Dogg, as investors.
""A number of the largest pension funds have hired additional people with strong corporate finance expertise, and we ... expect to see these funds taking the lead on larger transactions,"" Klaus Thune, co-head of Nordic banking at JP Morgan, said.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 11:58AM ET</span>",Citigroup profit beats on investment banking boost,"By Imani Moise and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reported higher-than-expected earnings on Monday despite declining revenue as the New York-based lender cut costs, grew its investment-banking business and expanded net-interest margin. 
Still, Citi improved its results in ways, including expense cutting, that may be tough to replicate in future quarters. A lower tax rate also played a big role in Citi’s improvement from a year ago. 
The bank’s income from continuing operations declined slightly. On a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said the decline was due in part to a divestiture last year. But net income rose because the bank's effective tax rate declined to 21 percent from 24 percent a year earlier.
Citi has been investing in digital capability to try to win deposits domestically despite its light U.S. branch network. Chief Executive Mike Corbat said in a statement its efforts are showing positive early results. 
But the bank is still growing deposits faster abroad than in the United States: International consumer deposits rose 3 percent during the quarter, while retail North American deposits edged up 1 percent.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Friday reported that its U.S. consumer deposits were up 3 percent from a year earlier.
Corbat also pointed to the bank's improved 11.9-percent return on average tangible common shareholder’s equity and the $5.1 billion it returned in capital to shareholders during the quarter. 
“Both our consumer and institutional businesses performed well and we saw good momentum in those areas where we have been investing,” he said.
Investment banking revenue rose 20 percent to $1.4 billion, as strong growth in advisory and investment-grade debt underwriting more than offset a drop in equity underwriting.
Bond trading rose 1 percent in sharp contrast to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan, both of which reported double-digit declines. 
But a 24-percent drop in equities trading pressured Citi's overall revenue, which fell 2 percent to $18.58 billion, slightly below analysts' estimates.
Revenue from consumer banking, the bank's largest business, was flat at $8.5 billion, due to weakness in Asia. 
North American branded cards revenue jumped 5 percent during the quarter, including the impact of a one-time gain the year before.
In 2018, Citigroup ranked third in the United States for outstanding credit-card loans, with an 11.4 percent market share, behind first-place JPMorgan Chase and second-place  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), according to The Nilson Report.
Earlier this year, the bank said it would earn $2 billion more in revenue from lending activities than it did in 2018.
Total loans at the third-largest U.S. bank by assets rose 3 percent to $682.3 billion, while deposits grew 5 percent to $1.03 trillion, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations.
Citi's net-interest margin, a closely watched metric, expanded 8 basis points to 2.72 percent in the quarter. Total operating expenses fell 3 percent to $10.58 billion
Leading into the reporting season some analysts feared that net interest margin would peak since the Federal Reserve signaled it would not raise interest rates this year. On a call with analysts, Mason said that a rate cut or the absence of a rate hike would not have a material impact on results for the year. 
Net income rose to $4.71 billion, or $1.87 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31 from $4.62 billion, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts were looking for a profit of $1.80 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

846,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Embarks on a Long Evolutionary Path,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There was nothing spectacular in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s first-quarter earnings. For Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, muddling through for now might just be the price to pay for his long-term vision.
In what was widely expected to be a tough three-month stretch, and certainly worse than the same period in 2018, the bank slightly exceeded a low bar for revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading, equity underwriting, investment banking and financial advisory services, while narrowly missing on equities sales and trading and debt underwriting. Effectively, it was a mixed bag.
Solomon said he was “pleased with our performance in the first quarter, especially in the context of a muted start to the year.” In a conference call, he attributed the sluggishness to a slowdown in initial public offerings and dampened market volatility. The bank also flagged a “decline in leveraged finance transactions.” 
The question, naturally, is whether those businesses will gain momentum in the months ahead. At first glance, the prospects are promising. In Europe, April has already experienced the highest value of traded IPOs since last October as the market starts bubbling again. More specifically to Goldman, the bank will be helping Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. go public in an expecting listing next month, which should buoy its second quarter. As for leveraged loans, prices have largely rebounded from their lows at the end of 2018, even though the floating interest rates are no longer as compelling with the Federal Reserve holding off on further policy tightening. 
Still, it’s hard to be too sure of anything in late-cycle financial markets, which could prove fickle as they did at the end of 2018. Perhaps that’s why Goldman shares fell as much as 3.2 percent after U.S. equity markets opened, compared with a gain of about 1 percent before the earnings announcement. 
Goldman, of course, doesn’t want to be so reliant on the market’s whims. Solomon said the firm is “focused on new opportunities to grow and diversify our business mix.” That includes initiatives like Marcus, its online service that offers personal loans and savings accounts with interest rates well above the average of brick-and-mortar competitors, and Marquee, a trading and risk-management platform that lets clients “make faster decisions on a bigger scale.” Goldman also partnered with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). on the technology giant’s new credit card, introduced last month. Solomon emphasized he wants to “increase the durability of our revenues.”
In perhaps the most notable line in his opening comments, Solomon said the bank is “on an evolutionary path.” 
That’s an aspirational thought, but it’s clearly not going to happen overnight. Not for Goldman. And it might never reach a similar balance as its competitors. Trading accounted for more than 41 percent of the bank’s $8.81 billion in net revenue in the first quarter. That’s not far off from the 43.7 percent share a year ago, and it’s more indicative of its current business model than when trading revenue fell to 30 percent of the total in the last three months of 2018.
That market dependence works during a quarter when the S&P 500 Index rose more than 13 percent, corporate bond spreads tightened and even Treasuries rallied. Institutional clients became “less cautious” in March, Solomon said, seemingly a signal that markets would be wide open throughout the second quarter. 
If that sort of market exuberance does come to pass, Goldman will most likely post stronger results in the next go-around. If not, it may scrape by yet again. But if that’s the cost of being “disruptive” and “an innovator,” Solomon and the bank’s leadership appear willing to ride the short-term ups and downs."

851,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 09:59AM ET</span>","Proxy firms Glass Lewis, ISS back Allergan in fight against Appaloosa","By Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Two major shareholder advisory firms urged investors to vote against billionaire investor David Tepper's hedge fund demand that Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc immediately split the roles of chief executive officer and chairman, in a boost to the Botox maker.
The recommendation from Institutional Shareholder Services LP and Glass Lewis & Co against the proposal of Tepper's Appaloosa gives firepower to Allergan Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders ahead of the drugmaker's shareholder meeting on May 1.
""Their recommendations affirm our position that our plan to adopt separate Chair and CEO positions with the next leadership transition is the best approach for Allergan shareholders,"" Allergan said in a statement.
However, an analyst said the recommendations were contrary to the views of many investors.
""This news is likely to frustrate a sizeable group of shareholders and we continue to await the result of the vote,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said. 
Appaloosa has been pressing Allergan since last year to separate the two roles, and asked for an immediate split after Allergan said an independent member of its board would be chairman, but only at its next leadership change. 
Both the proxy firms said that an immediate separation of the roles was not necessary.
""There are no significant concerns regarding the board's current leadership structure sufficient to suggest that an immediate split of the CEO and chairman roles is warranted at this time rather than at the next CEO transition,"" ISS was quoted as saying in the Allergan statement.
Appaloosa said ISS' recommendations were ""baffling"" as they were inconsistent with the firm's support for a similar proposal last year, and asked shareholders to vote for its proposal.
Allergan, under pressure to rescue the company's falling stock prices, launched a review of its strategy last year. But that review is likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit.
Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review, and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of its depression treatment rapastinel.

Allergan's shares have fallen about 12 percent in the past 12 months. They trade nearly 60 percent below their record high of $340.33 in 2015.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 09:55AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rejects Allergan bid to use tribe to shield drug patents,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cast aside pharmaceutical company Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc's unorthodox bid to shield patents from a federal administrative court's review by transferring them to a Native American tribe.
The justices left in place a lower court ruling upholding the authority of a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal to decide the validity of patents covering Allergan's dry eye drug Restasis, refusing to hear the company's appeal. Allergan had argued that the tribe's sovereign status under federal law made the patents immune from administrative review by the agency.
Generic drug company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV, seeking to sell its own lower-cost version of Restasis, in 2016 asked the agency's Patent Trial and Appeal Board to invalidate the Allergan patents on the grounds that they described obvious ideas.
Allergan, which has its headquarters in Dublin, in September 2017 transferred the patents to New York's Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which took legal ownership of the patents and then licensed them back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.
Allergan said it was protecting itself from the patent court, which it called a flawed and biased forum. The company said it did not object to the validity of its patents being reviewed by federal judges but took issue with the administrative court.
U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have called Allergan's deal with the tribe a sham.
The patent tribunal in February 2018 rejected Allergan's maneuver, saying tribal sovereign immunity does not apply to its patent review proceedings. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, affirmed that decision five months later.
Separate from the current court fight, the Restasis patents already have been invalidated. In October 2017, a federal judge in Texas took that step instead of waiting for the patent board to rule, a decision that was upheld on appeal. Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd have sought approval from U.S. regulators to sell generic versions of Restasis.

854,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>","Apple, allies seek billions in U.S. trial testing Qualcomm's business model","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its allies on Monday will kick off a jury trial against chip supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc in San Diego, alleging that Qualcomm engaged in illegal patent licensing practices and seeking up to $27 billion in damages. 
Qualcomm, for its part, alleges that Apple forced its longtime business partners to quit paying some royalties and is seeking up to $15 billion.
Filed by Apple in early 2017, the lawsuit in federal court revolves around the modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone or Apple Watch to wireless data networks. Qualcomm has spent the past two years mounting a pressure campaign of smaller legal skirmishes against Apple, seeking - and in some cases obtaining - iPhone sales bans for violating its patents.
The trial before Judge Gonzalo Curiel will play out on Qualcomm's home turf of San Diego, where for decades the city's National Football League team played in Qualcomm Stadium and nearly every business district hosts the mobile chip firm's logo.
For Apple, the trial is about the freedom to determine its own technology path for blockbuster products by buying chips without having to pay what it calls a ""tax"" on its innovations in the form of patent licensing fees to Qualcomm that take a cut of the selling price of its devices. 
For Qualcomm, the trial, along with similar allegations from U.S. regulators in a January court hearing, will determine the fate of its unique blend of selling chips and licensing more than 130,000 patents. 
Licensing generates most of Qualcomm profits. The model propelled Qualcomm from a small contract research and development shop when founded in 1985 to a global chip powerhouse important enough to U.S. national security that President Donald Trump personally intervened to prevent a hostile takeover of the company last year.
“This is the day of reckoning that Qualcomm has been very fortunate to avoid for many years,"" said Gaston Kroub, a patent attorney with Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case. ""In Apple, they’ve finally come up against a potential licensee that has the resources and the will to put Qualcomm's business model and licensing practices on trial.”
Qualcomm requires device makers to sign a license to its patents before it will supply chips, which it views as a commonsense measure to ensure it does not do business with companies violating its patents. But Apple and other device makers around the world have called the ""no license, no chips"" policy a form of ""double dipping"" - that is, charging for the same intellectual property once during licensing discussions, and then again in the price of the chips where the patents are embodied.
Apple and allies are asking for an end to that practice and a refund of about $9 billion - an amount that could be tripled if a jury finds in Apple's favor for antitrust allegations - for contract factories such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd's Foxconn, who paid the royalties and were reimbursed by Apple. Apple alleges the practices kept rivals like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) out of the market for years.
""Even very big companies like Intel have felt at a disadvantage,"" said Michael Salzman, an antitrust attorney with Hughes Hubbard & Reed not involved in the case.
Qualcomm will argue that it had been working successfully with contract factories for years before Apple introduced its iPhone. But Apple used its heft in the industry to get those factories to break their longstanding contracts with Qualcomm, depriving it of at least $7 billion in royalties it was due, the chip supplier alleges. 
The chip supplier will also argue that its licensing practices have been consistent for decades and only came under fire when Apple, known in the electronics industry for pushing suppliers to contain costs, took issue with it. A victory would secure Qualcomm's status as a major technology provider for 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks coming online this year.

""I don't think (a Qualcomm victory) would be great for Apple, but if it's about money, they've got plenty of money,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an equity analyst for Bernstein who follows Qualcomm. ""For Qualcomm, it's an existential attack on the meat of their business model.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Biotech company Hutchison China MediTech, known as Chi-Med, has filed for a Hong Kong listing, which four sources close to the matter said could raise up to $500 million.
Chi-Med, which is already listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq in New York, filed its listing application with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday.
""We are delighted to announce our proposed Hong Kong listing and global offering of shares,"" said Simon To, Chairman of Chi-Med, which is 60.2 percent owned by CK Hutchison.
Chi-Med's statement did not say how much it planned to raise.
The company did say it expected to use net proceeds from any primary sale of shares in the offering to fund the late-stage clinical development of its global and China pipeline and advance its pipeline of clinical-stage drug candidates.
Chi-Med also said it wanted to list in Hong Kong to improve liquidity for shareholders and strengthen its access to capital.
The deal, which also includes a secondary share sale by parent CK Hutchison Holdings, could raise up to $500 million, the people said, with one saying the size would be between $400 million and $500 million. Another source said the deal size would likely be around $300 million.
Deal sizes can change and are often smaller than the original target size.
CK Hutchison plans to reduce its stake to below 50 percent and will include a secondary share sale as part of the Hong Kong listing.
Hong Kong has sought to transform itself into a listing hub for emerging biotech companies to compete with other financial centers such as New York by changing its listing rules to allow companies with no revenues in the sector to list.
While the first few listings performed poorly, the two biotech companies that completed their initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong this year have done well.
CanSino Biologics is up 89 percent from its IPO price while CStone Pharmaceuticals is up 30 percent from its offer price.
Two sources said the company was aiming for a listing by the summer.
Chi-Med reported a loss of $74.8 million on revenues of $214.1 million in 2018, its draft IPO prospectus showed. It loss in 2017 was $26.7 million on revenues of $241.2 million.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are joint sponsors for the Chi-Med listing.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",Shareholder adviser ISS opposes free pass for UBS bosses after tax ruling,"By Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS shareholders should oppose discharging the board and top management of Switzerland's biggest bank from liability after a guilty verdict in a French tax evasion case, proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said.
""A vote against the formal discharge of the board of directors and senior management is warranted on a precautionary basis, as the company was recently found guilty of illegal solicitation and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion by a French court,"" ISS said in a statement received by Reuters on Monday, ahead of UBS's May 2 annual shareholders meeting.
This is the latest opposition from shareholder advisers after a French court in February found UBS guilty of illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, ordering it to pay 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in penalties. 
UBS denies the charges and is appealing against the ruling it has called ""incomprehensible"".
A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment on ISS's recommendations. 
Ethos Foundation on Friday recommended UBS shareholders reject all of the Swiss bank's executive and board pay proposals at the annual meeting, including binding votes on bonuses and pay packages.
Also last week, adviser Glass Lewis voiced its objections to the UBS pay proposal, citing ""pay-for-performance concern"", and recommended shareholders abstain on the discharge question.
Even if ISS does not get its way, a significant showing of shareholder opposition to the board's and management's discharge would be a blow to Chairman Axel Weber and Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, who last month boosted provisions to cover the case but said they still expect the verdict to be reversed. 
Ermotti has said he ""disappointed"" by the court ruling, but highlighted the bank's strong capital and liquidity as reasons UBS could afford to fight the French case.
A compliance expert and partner at Swiss law firm Lalive, Daniel Buehr, said a company's board is most accountable, since its members are tasked with making certain that management in important legal cases works in the interest of the company and is not driven by personal motivations. 
""It can be damaging when managers commit their reputations and names and then cannot beat a retreat,"" Buehr said.
""In such situations, which happen again and again because it's human nature, it's the board's job to lead, to take control and manage the risks.""

As carmakers scramble to develop advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving functions, carmakers are struggling to find qualified engineers to build the software algorithms needed to teach cars the right reflexes. 
Volkswagen has 4,000 engineers in China, with an average age of 29, spread over five research and development sites and a rapidly growing number of software engineers. 
""In a short period from now they will be able to do 15 to 20 million lines of programming code on an annual basis,"" Volkswagen China's passenger cars chief Stephan Woellenstein said in Shanghai on Monday. 
The prevalence of software engineers, combined with the country's willingness to roll out the infrastructure for connected and self-driving cars, will make China one of the first markets in which autonomous cars gain widespread acceptance, VW managers said. 
As a result, Chinese suppliers will help Volkswagen Group to design a global autonomous vehicle architecture, he said. 
""Part of the software development work can be done for instance in Chinese facilities out of Volkswagen Group China,"" Woellenstein said. 
For connected vehicles technology China will become a leading global research and development center, said Sven Patuschka, Head of Volkswagen Group China's research and development.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks rose moderately after progress in the U.S.-China trade talks buoyed sentiment and investors grew somewhat optimistic about the next batch of corporate earnings. 
The Stoxx Europe 600 recovered from earlier losses and rose higher, with gains in banks offsetting declines in miners. 
Investors are focused on the U.S. earnings season to gauge the strength of corporate America in the face of major challenges to growth. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). posted strong first-quarter results last week, and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). is due on Tuesday.
Equities in Asia approached a fresh six-month high, spurred on by markets in Japan and Korea, after the Bank of China released upbeat credit data.

868,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>","After 60,000% Rally, America’s Top Stock Has Suddenly Gone Cold","(Bloomberg) -- Who’s the biggest winner in the stock market this century? Amazon maybe? Or perhaps Apple? Up 2,300 percent and 5,300 since January 2000, respectively, they’re both good guesses.
It turns out, though, that they’re not even close to the actual No. 1 stock in that period --  Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST). That’s right, the energy-drink company with the black and neon green label has dominated all other stocks in the index, returning almost 60,000 percent over the period.
It’s a historic rally by nearly any measure, one that was fueled by Monster growing earnings in every year since 2008, and annual revenue growth that hasn’t dipped below 9 percent since 2001.
“Energy drinks are the carbonated soft drinks of this generation, and Monster has consistently been able to expand its product lines with great success,” said Caroline Levy, an analyst at Macquarie Capital.
But now it’s running into serious headwinds -- the stock dropped about 18 percent in the past few weeks -- as new competitors enter the $50 billion energy-drink market. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is selling a private-label energy drink and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is launching Coca-Cola Energy in Europe last month.
No Takeover?
The Coca-Cola product is seen as particularly notable. The company owns nearly 19 percent of Monster, according to Bloomberg data, making it by far the largest stakeholder. It also distributes Monster products, and analysts have long speculated that the Dow component would buy Monster outright, which has a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion. But the energy launch was seen as a step away from that, particularly as it came after Coke spent $5.1 billion buying the Costa coffee chain in August.
“I think the opportunity has passed, that Coke won’t buy them now,” said Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Monster hit a home run when it signed Coke as a distributor, but there’s a real risk that Coke’s energy line disrupts a really strong partnership, and that it slows Monster internationally.”
Monster declined to comment.
While Amazon and Coca-Cola are dominant in their industries, the biggest competitive threat could be from Bang, an energy drink from Vital Pharma whose recent growth is widely seen as coming at the expense of Monster.
Market Share
Monster Beverage had a market share of 35.4 percent in the energy-drink category in March, down 3.5 percentage points from the prior year, according to all-channel IRI data. The company share for Red Bull dropped less than a percentage point, to 38.2 percent. Vital Pharma’s share, meanwhile, jumped from just over 1 percent to 8.3 percent.
Bang’s “surge in growth is from a small base, but it had to come out of something, and it looks like it came out of Monster,” Shea said.
Monster recently announced a new drink line, Reign, designed to compete with Bang, and so far analysts are divided on its potential. Some firms have affirmed their bullishness, including RBC and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which recently named the company a top pick.
But in early March, Citi removed Monster from its focus list, seeing “less room for upside” at current valuations; on Thursday, analyst Wendy Nicholson cut her price target to $66 from $74, expecting competition “to remain stiff in the near term.” The move followed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which cut its own target last month. Wells Fargo’s Bonnie Herzog wrote Friday that a survey of beverage retailer sentiment shows “massive declines” in Monster since November.
Monster shares last hit record levels in January 2018, and remain more than 20 percent below that. For now, though, it retains bragging rights for the 21st Century.

While London-listed bank stocks have recovered from last year’s lows as the risk of a “no-deal Brexit” gradually subsides, a snap election is becoming more likely as lawmakers in Westminster remain unable to agree on a future relationship with the EU. Citigroup’s review of Labour Party pledges doesn’t bode well for the financial sector.
“The impact on U.K. domestic bank EPS could potentially be similar in magnitude to a no-deal Brexit outcome, mainly due to a fall in business investment, housing controls, less cost flexibility and higher taxes,” analysts including Andrew Coombs wrote in a note to clients.
Domestic banks would initially move sharply lower with the pound if Labour came to power, due to the “business unfriendly” deficit-financed policies included in the party’s current manifesto that would likely lead to capital outflows from the U.K., Citigroup says. The more international banks would likely “hold firm,” however, given the boost from an expected decline in sterling.
On Labour’s intention to nationalize and break-up The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc, Citigroup says it remains unclear how such a plan would be financed.

(Reuters) - European shares edged higher in quiet trading on Monday, with bank stocks leading the gains, as Sino-U.S. trade optimism and strong Chinese economic data eased some worries over the global economy.
By 0932 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent, hovering near eight-month highs. The banks-heavy Italian and Spanish indices led the gains.
Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Global Thematic Group in London, said banking stocks could be rising due to ""U.S. and German yield curves starting to move off their lows"".
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) handily beating quarterly profit estimates on Friday and kickstarting the U.S. corporate earnings season on a strong note could be another factor helping banks, Taylor said.
""It's very quiet Monday. Apart from a few earnings catalysts through the week, it looks like people are just largely sitting on the sidelines,"" he said.
Asian shares began the week with a positive tone after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he hoped that the United States and China were close to the final round of negotiations.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 05:59AM ET</span>","AB InBev adds Citi, BAML to banks working on $5 billion Asian IPO: sources","By Julie Zhu and Julia Fioretti
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has added  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to the team of banks working on the sale of its Asia-Pacific business, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The two join  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), both of which are the sponsors, or leads, for the planned Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) which could raise up to $5 billion for the heavily indebted brewer, the people said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
With main markets China and Australia, the region last year made up 18 percent of group volume and 14 percent of underlying operating profit, which in turn rose 13 percent to $3.1 billion. It was not clear how much of the business was up for sale.
AB InBev did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citi and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment.
The Leuven, Belgium-based maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois brands aims to spin-off its Asia-Pacific business to reduce leverage, the people said.
AB InBev's net debt stood at $102.5 billion at the end of December, a figure inflated by its late 2016 purchase of nearest rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) for around $100 billion. AB InBev wants to bring its net debt/EBITDA ratio to around two times from a multiple of 4.6 at the end of last year. With that goal, it has halved its proposed dividend and said payouts will only grow slowly.
While AB InBev's shares have risen 19 percent since reporting forecast-beating earnings in February, the brewer is battling to reverse a longer share price decline. Over the past two years, its shares have fallen 24 percent, in contrast to rivals Heineken and Carlsberg (CO:CARLa), which have gained 15 and 28 percent respectively.
The IPO would not be the first time AB InBev has sold Asia-Pacific assets to reduce debt. After InBev bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008, AB InBev sold South Korean unit Oriental Brewery to private equity firm KKR - only to buy it back in 2014.
The IPO is slated for the second half of the year and the brewer expects to file with the Hong Kong stock exchange in the first half, the people said. One of the people said the filing would happen either later this month or early May.
At $5 billion, the IPO could be the largest in Hong Kong this year, where the flood of companies looking to go public has slowed to a trickle.
Companies have raised $2.9 billion through Hong Kong listings so far this year, lagging the $6.4 billion raised on New York's Nasdaq, showed Refinitiv data as of Friday.

Hong Kong topped all other exchanges globally last year with stock market listings raising $36.3 billion. This year, however, is widely expected to be slower due to thinning numbers of Chinese companies looking to go public, particularly in tech.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 05:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Foxconn chairman Gou aims to step down to pave way for younger talent,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - The chairman of Taiwan's Foxconn, an assembler of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones, said on Monday he plans to step down in the coming months to pave the way for younger talent to move up the company's ranks.
A change in leadership would come at a delicate time for the world's largest contract manufacturer, which is trying to reinvent itself to cut its reliance on Apple as smartphone sales plateau and as the iPhone maker diversifies its supplier base.
It would mark another top-level change at a tech firm in Greater China.
Jack Ma, co-founder of China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, said in September he will step down as chairman in a year to allow for younger management. And Morris Chang, founder and chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), another Apple supplier, retired last year. 
Terry Gou, speaking on the sidelines of an event in Taipei, said that while he planned to resign as Foxconn chairman, he hoped to remain involved in strategic decisions regarding the company's business.
When asked by Reuters if he would quit as chairman, Gou said he was moving in that direction, although any decision needed to be discussed with the company's board. 
""I don't know where you got the information from. But I have to say, basically, I'm working toward that direction - to walk back to the second line, or retire,"" Gou said.
""I will be involved in the major direction of the company, but not involved in daily operations.
""I'm already 69 years old. I can pass down my 45 years of experience. That's the goal I set up - to let young people learn sooner and take over sooner and to replace my position sooner."" 
Gou said his plans would be discussed with the board of Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, in the coming months and shareholders would be told at the AGM in June. 
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Lu Sung-Ching, the chairman of Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd, the electronic and optoelectronic connectors unit of Foxconn, was among the possible candidates to take over from Gou.
""It doesn't mean he will just be gone. He will remove himself to the second line and he would not be involved in the daily operations,"" the source said.
SHARES CLIMB
Shares of Foxconn, which has a market value of $40 billion, rose after the news and closed 3.2 percent higher on Monday.
The news comes as tech companies are seeking to diversify their customer base and move into emerging industries such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.
Foxconn, which celebrated 30 years of doing business in China last year, has far-flung businesses that include autonomous car startups and investments in cancer research.
In January, the Nikkei reported that Foxconn had let go around 50,000 contract workers in China since October. 
Foxconn acquired control of Japan’s Sharp Corp in 2016 to try to boost the Taiwanese company’s advanced screen technology.
Founded in 1974, the Foxconn group has grown to become the world's biggest contract manufacturer with T$5.2 trillion ($168.52 billion) in annual revenue, assembling goods for Apple, SoftBank Group Corp and other global tech firms. It relies on Apple for more than half of annual revenue, according to analysts.
Gou, who owns 9.4 percent of Foxconn as its top shareholder, is Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.
Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.
The news comes three months after Reuters reported Foxconn was reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus. Foxconn later reiterated it would still build a factory in Wisconsin after Gou spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump.

876,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>","Goldman Says Europe Buybacks Will Rise, But Not to U.S. Levels","(Bloomberg) -- Share buybacks will continue to increase in Europe, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., though a number of factors will keep them from becoming as popular as they are in the U.S.
“As a percent of cash usage, buybacks are small in Europe (6 percent) compared with the U.S. (25 to 30 percent),” strategists led by Sharon Bell wrote in a note April 12. “Buybacks have started to rise in Europe, and we expect this trend to continue.”
Drivers of the divide include European uncertainty that creates a need for a bigger cash buffer, earnings-per-share visibility as quarterly reporting is less common in Europe, and overall lower profitability in Europe in recent years, the strategists wrote. An ownership structure that’s different from the U.S., where management and staff have a greater portion of shares, also adds to the discrepancy, they said.
Buybacks have been getting increased scrutiny from politicians in the wake of U.S. tax reforms in late 2017, when companies used money saved from the lower levies to return cash to shareholders. Goldman’s New York-based strategist David Kostin slammed “misconceptions” about the practice in a note last month, following it up more recently with an ominous look at “a world without buybacks.”
“In 2007, share repurchases made up 12 percent of cash use, versus 6 percent today, implying upside potential,” the strategists said. “But we doubt that European companies will embrace a more U.S.-style buyback culture.”"
877,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 04:39AM ET</span>",Barclays activist Bramson renews call to join the board,"LONDON (Reuters) - Activist Edward Bramson on Monday made a renewed plea for Barclays' investors to give him a seat on the bank's board, as the war of words between his Sherborne Investors fund and the lender's management ratchets up.
Both camps have begun a back-and-forth courting of shareholders ahead of the bank's May 2 annual general meeting as Bramson attempts to muscle in on decision-making at the company and push through his proposal for a strategic overhaul of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) investment bank.
After both issued statements last week laying out their case, New York-based Bramson again wrote to investors on Monday to say nothing Barclays had said had made him change his view about what needed to change at the bank.
""In our firm's professional opinion, the stubbornly low valuation that the market accords to the shares of Barclays will continue until the board finally adopts a strategy that is more realistic and shareholder orientated,"" Bramson said.
Barclays said last week that it plans to stick to its efforts to improve performance at the investment bank rather than scale it back in size.
Given that, Bramson reiterated his call to join the board.
""Our public investment record shows that we have consistently assisted boards, that were initially reluctant, to deliver major increases in value for all of the shareholders,"" Bramson said.
""We believe that, given mutual goodwill, and some change in perspective, Barclays offers similar opportunities.""
However, Barclays' defense against the activist received a boost over the weekend after shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis recommended investors vote against Bramson's bid to join the board.
While Glass Lewis said the activist's arguments had some merit, with shareholders getting ""fairly mediocre returns"", it none the less took a dim view of the motion.

""We ultimately believe support for Sherborne's proposal would entail considerably greater risk and uncertainty and, based on available disclosure, would be predicated on substantially unknown strategic intentions,"" the advisory group said.

878,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Sees Two Big Reasons Low Volatility Will End,"(Bloomberg) -- A combination of low liquidity and high complacency mean cross-asset volatility won’t stay at historic lows for much longer, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“There are still two things that argue against the current levels of volatility being correct or sustainable,” cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets said in an interview Friday. “The first is that market liquidity is still not great. The second: I’m not sure that the market in its newfound optimism has taken the story to the logical conclusion” about where asset prices are headed, he said.
Price swings in currencies, bonds and other asset classes have slumped amid a dovish shift from global central banks, increased economic stimulus from China, and easing trade tensions. The Cboe Volatility Index has fallen over 50 percent this year, and closed Friday at the lowest level in six months. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s MOVE Index, a gauge of volatility in Treasuries, is heading back toward its record low.
A disconnect between the growth in financial market size over the past decade and the capacity of banks to take on risk -- which hasn’t kept pace -- could exacerbate any selloffs, according to Sheets. Complacent market participants who equate a Federal Reserve on hold with low volatility is also an issue, and big price moves could soon surprise, he said.
“If the Fed stays dovish and the data weaken, volatility will go higher,” he said. “If the data pick up and central banks are effectively saying we’re not going to tighten in the face of improving data, wouldn’t that generate a lot more risk-taking behavior? And that would be volatile too.”
A number of strategists have also voiced concern over the impact of low liquidity.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s John Marshall and Rocky Fishman warned in December about the risks of falling volumes and market depth. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Marko Kolanovic expressed concern this month about the negative feedback loop between volatility and liquidity.
Cautionary Tale
Investors may have gotten into the habit of selling volatility, which could be keeping some measures of it lower, according to Sheets. The strategist views 2007 as a cautionary tale for anyone who sees the world of low price swings as a time for complacency -- that year too you had a very flat yield curve and low implied volatility.
“The way the market explained that dynamic was, the Fed has stopped hiking and is now going to keep policy stable and will be for a while, and the economy’s a little soft,” he said. “That’s not how things transpired.”

Investing.com -- Earnings season may be ramping up but it’s M&A activity that's grabbing most attention in Europe’s stock markets this morning.
The biggest eye-catcher is French advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP), which rose over 4% at the opening after announcing it had agreed to buy the marketing data unit of  Alliance Data Systems  (NYSE:ADS) for some $4.4 billion. It’s given up some of those gains since, but the move — Publicis’ biggest ever acquisition — is exactly the type of investment it needs to get ahead in digital marketing and reduce its dependence on an old-media ad business that is being squeezed hard by the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Publicis was leading the CAC 40, which was broadly flat. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was also essentially unchanged at 387.40, despite more hints over the weekend that China and the U.S. are approaching agreement on their various trade disputes. The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% and Germany’s Dax was down 0.1%, not helped by a drop in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares after a report alleging further emissions-related misdeeds on Sunday.
Meanwhile in London, IWG (LON:IWG), the office space company formerly known as Regus, rose as much as 20% in early trading after agreeing to sell its Japanese business to Tokyo-based TKP for 320 million pounds ($420 milion), a sum that’s around 3.4 times the business’s annual revenue.
Under a franchise agreement due to start next month, IWG will also continue to get an unspecified fee from TKP, which will act as operator for all of IWG’s flexible workspaces in Japan.
Finally, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) was up 0.5% after reporting further progress in preparing the sale of a stake in Universal Media Group. Vivendi said it would soon complete the process of choosing banks to manage the sale of up to half of the unit, which is worth $30 billion by some estimates. UMG’s revenue rose 19% in constant-currency terms in the first quarter, accounting for nearly all of a 5.7% increase in group revenue."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) is refunding more than A$3 million ($2.2 million) to retail customers in Australia who suffered losses from complex investments sold by the bank without adequate advice, the country's corporate watchdog said on Monday.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said it had concerns the bank's financial advisers had sold the complex products without complying with regulatory and disclosure obligations required to provide personal financial advice.
Following an investigation by the regulator, Citi will refund 114 customers who invested in complex fixed coupon products and other capital at risk products between 2013 and 2017 and lost money, the regulator said in a statement.
The bank will also give customers with remaining investments in the products an opportunity to exit ""without cost,"" the regulator said.
Following ASIC's investigation, Citi on Jan. 1, 2018, stopped selling structured products to retail clients without adequate personal financial advice, it said.
""While Citi maintains the view that none of its actions amounted to a breach of its obligations, Citi has acknowledged ASIC's concerns and is making a payment to this (small) group of clients,"" a Citi spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
The bank confirmed it no longer offers the products to Australian retail investors without taking into account their personal circumstances and providing them with personal advice.
It has completed about 75 percent of the refunds, the spokeswoman said.

Citi is also defending a lawsuit brought against it by the country's competition regulator over a 2015 capital raising.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Rene-Christopher Wollmann, head of Mercedes-AMG's 2.75 million euros Project One supercar program, has moved to a job at Automobili Pininfarina in a sign that innovation in high end electric sportscars is shifting toward small start-ups.
Wollman's move, which has not been made public, comes at a time when big carmakers, like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Mercedes, have been blindsided by stricter and costly emissions tests, forcing them to focus resources on mainstream electric models and on cleaning up their combustion engines.
Meanwhile advances in virtual engineering allow even small teams of engineers to develop roadworthy vehicles using software to design, engineer and test prototypes. This dynamic has already helped Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and China's Nio steal a march on much larger rivals in the premium electric sportscar segment. 
""Large companies take time to transform. And I am good at hypercars. I just did Project One, and now this opportunity came,"" 37-year-old Wollmann told Reuters about his reason for joining Automobili Pininfarina, a Munich-based electric carmaker that launched last year.
Project One, which has a modified Formula One engine, was due to go on sale this year but has been delayed by problems getting road worthiness certification following the introduction of WLTP emissions test standards, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Premium or high-performance electric sports cars are equivalent to the Ferraris and Lamborghinis of the conventional auto world. These so-called supercars can cost anything from about $100,000 up into the millions of dollars and include Tesla's upcoming Roadster Founder Series, which will sell for over $200,000 and the Rimac Concept Two, priced in the region of $2 million.
The emerging role of start-ups in the development of the premium electric market harks back to an era over a century ago when talented engineers like Gottlieb Daimler and Ferdinand Porsche were able to launch sportscar brands on modest budgets. 
Players leading the way include the likes of Automobili Pininfarina, Croatia's Rimac, China's Nio and Italian engineering shop Italy's Maniffatura Automobili Torino (MAT).
But because of the high initial investment needed, with no guarantee of success in a niche market, boutique supercar manufacturers face significant risks if they try to develop more than one vehicle or shift to becoming mainstream carmakers.
400 KM/HOUR
Wollmann was hired because he also helped develop an electric version of the AMG SLS for AMG Mercedes, a skill that will help Automobili Pininfarina, owned by India's Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, develop its own zero-emissions vehicle. 
""I did the first electric hypercar for AMG so this was the perfect fit,"" he said. 
Since its 2018 launch, Automobili Pininfarina has hired a raft of top-flight German engineers. Christian Jung, Porsche's chief engineer of E-Mobility systems, and Peter Tutzer, a former technical director at supercar brand Bugatti, are part of the team.
They are designing the ""Battista"", an electric supercar with a top speed of at least 300 km an hour (186 mph) and acceleration from 0 to 100 in under two seconds. Around 150 will be built, costing 2 million pounds each, the company said. 
""Rene Wollmann came to us because he said it was difficult to realize projects like these at a large company,"" Michael Perschke, Automobili Pininfarina's Chief Executive told Reuters.
Another start-up electric carmaker, Rimac, will provide the Battista's electric motor and battery pack. 
Rimac has built up expertise in high-performance electric vehicle powertrain and battery systems. It already has 500 developers in Croatia and made an electric sportscar capable of speeds of 400 km an hour. 
Its expertise led Porsche to take a 10 percent stake in the carmaker last year.
""Powertrains with 700 kilowatts of capacity are a niche product. Porsche focuses on the high volume stuff. They don't have the capacity to deal with every niche,"" 31-year-old company founder Mate Rimac told Reuters.
'NOT ALL IN'
There are two ways to make battery-driven vehicles: to use a clean-sheet design like Tesla, or to take a conventional vehicle platform that can also accommodate an electric version.
For now, Daimler and VW have taken the latter approach, building electric cars on the same assembly line as their conventional vehicles, allowing them to scale up production without having to build dedicated electric car factories.
VW has however started development of a fully dedicated electric car, the ID, which is due to hit showrooms next year.
Daimler engineers say the trend towards multi-powertrain platforms is likely to persist thanks to improvements in battery technology which allow even multi-powertrain designs to spawn electric cars with an operating range of over 400 km. 
But critics counter that combustion-engined cars have less space for large batteries, resulting in vehicles with a compromised design that have a shorter operating range than cars designed as electric cars from the ground up.
""Eight years later and Tesla still has the better car than the Audi E-Tron, or the Mercedes EQC,"" Rimac said. ""It is not because the Germans are stupid. It is because they are not 'all-in'. They work from the basis of the combustion engine toward electrification. I started electric only."" 
Start-up carmakers are better able to compete with large established players thanks to advances in virtual engineering and the prevalence of consulting firms that specialize in software and IT systems, like Germany's Ferchau Engineering and Italy's Danisi Engineering.
Automobili Pininfarina is testing the effectiveness of its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) virtually, using a driving simulator program provided by Modena-based Danisi, drastically cutting down development and fine-tuning costs.
""You do 80 percent of chassis development this way and reduce development time by six to eight months. The rest is validation and fine tuning,"" Automobili Pininfarina's chief product officer Paolo Dellacha said. 
Before joining the start-up carmaker, Dellacha held various testing and engineering roles at Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Maserati and Alfa Romeo.
Meanwhile Daimler's AMG Project One, launched in September 2017, with 1,000 horsepower and a top speed exceeding 350 km an hour, will not reach customers until next year.
""There are some details we need to sort out with the vehicles,"" AMG spokesman Jochen Uebler said, when asked about the certification problems.

884,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 02:05AM ET</span>",Corporate jetmakers court Chinese elite for sales despite slowing economy,"By Allison Lampert, Jamie Freed and Brenda Goh
MONTREAL/SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Gulfstream Aerospace and Bombardier are trotting out their longest-range business jets at an Asian air show this week, as they compete for orders from China's growing elite, despite the country's slowing economy. 
The Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition, (ABACE) opens Tuesday in Shanghai under a cloud of economic uncertainty, amid slowing Chinese growth, the U.S.-China trade dispute, and Beijing's crackdown on debt risks that has led funding to dry up in certain industries, brokers said.
""The biggest factor that impacted the business jet market was pessimism and uncertainty which stalled purchase intentions or forced those marginal owners to reconsider keeping their business jets,"" said Jeffrey Lowe, managing director of Hong Kong-based Asian Sky Group.
Still, Canada's Bombardier sees its new $73 million Global 7500 business jet making inroads in Greater China against market leader Gulfstream's $65 million-plus G650 family. 
The plane and train maker said on Sunday it secured firm orders for four Global 7500 planes that were converted from options taken by Hong Kong-based business jet management company HK Bellawings in 2018. 
Greater China's number of billionaires has been growing yearly by 10 percent over the past three years, and the Global 7500's long range will help to ""seize market share and to withstand any economic uncertainty in the region,"" said Bombardier Business Aircraft President David Coleal by email.
Both Gulfstream's 650ER and the Global 7500 connect far-flung cities like New York and Tokyo, an allure for elite Asian buyers who want to fly non-stop to Western hubs.
""You don't need a G7500 to fly three or four hours. But when you do need (longer) range you can use this jet,"" said Thomas Flohr, founder and chairman of Vista Global and a Global 7500 customer.
Gulfstream, a division of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), which brought its large-cabin G500 jet into service last year, delivered 68 new corporate aircraft between 2015 and 2018 in the region, more than double the 32 planes delivered by its Canadian competitor, according to Asian Sky. 
On Monday, Gulfstream announced the sale of a G650 to Chinese manufacturing and metal distribution company Jiachen Group.
Gulfstream President Mark Burns said by email the U.S. company is seeing more optimism in the region and is ""starting to see more activity as trade talks appear to be progressing and becoming more specific."" 
The Asia Pacific region, nevertheless, accounted for only about 8 percent of the 3,478 business jets delivered globally over the last five years, compared with 2,122 jets delivered to North America, according to Cirium Fleets Analyzer data. 
And the number of Chinese-owned second-hand business jets sold outside the country rose to 20 in 2018, compared with an annual average of 10 from 2014 to 2017, according to the Cirium data.
Jackie Wu, president of JetSolution Aviation Group, said weaker business jet sales have prompted her Hong Kong company to launch its first charter service using the supermidsized Embraer Legacy 600.

""We are an industry that very much reflects the health of an economy, or the world economy,"" said Jetcraft Asia president David Dixon, adding he nevertheless sees greater demand from other Asian countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.

""Anything below that amount would make little sense,"" Diess said on the sidelines of the Shanghai Auto Show on Sunday.
Volkswagen will buy 50 billion euros ($56.57 billion) worth of battery cells for electric cars and has identified South Korea's SKI, LG Chem and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI as strategic battery cell suppliers as well as China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL).
The German automaker is retooling 16 factories to build electric vehicles and plans to start producing 33 different electric cars under the Skoda, Audi, VW and Seat brands by mid 2023.
""We are considering an investment in a battery manufacturer in order to reinforce our electrification offensive and build up the necessary know-how,"" Volkswagen said.
SKI is building a battery cell manufacturing plant in the United States to supply Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
SKI will supply lithium-ion battery cells for an electric car that Volkswagen plans to start making in Chattanooga in 2022.

LG Chem, Samsung and SKI on will also supply battery cells for Volkswagen in Europe. CATL is the automaker's strategic partner for China, and will supply batteries for its electric fleet from 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) is removing several thousand electric bikes from service in its bike-share program in New York, Washington and San Francisco because of a braking problem, the ride-hailing company said on Sunday. 
""We recently received a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel,"" the company said in a blog post emailed to customers on Sunday.
The company's bike share division is working to replace about 3,000 pedal-assist bikes in New York, Washington and San Francisco with traditional bikes to prevent service interruptions. The company already operates about 17,000 traditional bikes in those cities. 
The bike share brands that were impacted by the service removal include Citi Bike in New York, Capital Bikeshare in Washington D.C., and Ford GoBike in the Bay Area.
Some of the electric bikes are still on docks but customers will no longer be able to rent them. 
“After a small number of reports and out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively pausing our electric bikes from service, said Citi Bike spokeswoman Julie Wood. ""Safety always comes first.”
The company said it had been working on a new electric bike model that would be ready to deploy soon. 

Lyft, which went public in March, bought Citi Bike operator Motivate last year in a move to fend off competition from rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc’s purchase of electric cycle-sharing startup JUMP Bikes months before.

887,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 14, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",Another Warning Is Flashing on Asia's 12% Stock-Market Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Skeptics watching Asia’s double-digit stock market growth this year just got some data to help their case: equity ETF inflows have dwindled.
Despite a 9 percent increase to $502 billion in assets under management for Asia equity exchange-traded funds so far this year, net inflows have been tapering off, according to data compiled by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). On top of that, a monthly net outflow -- the second time in more than two years -- was recorded in March.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s 12 percent rally this year -- adding about $4 trillion in value -- has already been attracting some skepticism. Market watchers have been warning that investors should be cautious after the best first-quarter rally since 2012 for the regional benchmark index:
“At the end of last year, we were pricing something like Armageddon in regards to rates and the trade outlook,” said Christopher Watson, London-based fund manager with Finisterre Capital, in an interview in Hong Kong Friday. “The equity market is convinced everything seems to be rainbow and sunshine for the remainder of the year. And I guess one of the things we find somewhat disconcerting is the disconnect between rates and equity,” he said.
Some investors might be quietly pulling out of this surge -- the regional benchmark gauge posted a loss last week.
And in China, the first in Asia to enter a bull market this year, the Shanghai Composite Index posted its worst week this year. Chinese investors boosted leverage for 10 straight sessions through Wednesday to a 10-month high of 960.3 billion yuan ($143 billion). That amount, which is more than the five-year average, might prompt the government to cool the country’s world-beating stocks rally.
It’s hard to ignore the reasons behind the buoyant market: a dovish tilt in central banks, hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal, investors expecting more inflows due to a bigger weighting of Chinese companies in MSCI Inc.’s gauges, and government policies to boost the market. Though this might somewhat be stymied by MSCI Inc.’s statement last week that it will delay the transition of MSCI All China Indexes to the MSCI China All Shares Indexes to Nov. 26 from June 1, following feedback from market participants.
Still, China’s trade and lending data released on Friday, signaled that the world’s second-largest economy was on more stable footing, sending U.S. stocks higher.
For Frank Benzimra, the head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), Asian stocks have more upside than the U.S. market, which he expects to bottom out next year. “The Asia equities rebound will continue in the coming quarter as policy fundamentals are improving, equity valuations remain moderate,” and equity market position is still “light,” he wrote in a March report.
JPMorgan’s Kerry Craig sees a light at the end of the tunnel with somewhat stronger economic data coming out of parts of Asia, pointing to “a lifting in that industrial production cycle, that manufacturing cycle, that can help maintain the equity outlook,” he said. “That creates a floor under it, and if we look at the Asian market in particular, it’s going to benefit from that.”
While earlier this year, economic data for the region fell short of projections by the most in three years, that seems to be turning around. Since mid-March, the Citi Economic Surprise Index for Asia Pacific has indicated that even though data releases have been worse than expected, the trend is shifting to in-line expectations.
Even so, on Saturday global finance ministers and central bankers said they were prepared to “act promptly” to shore up growth in a world economy that faces downside risks including trade tensions, according to a statement by the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the main advisory panel of the IMF’s 189 member countries.
And flows don’t paint an optimistic picture. Global equity fund withdrawals continued for a fourth week during the April 4 to 10 period, according to the latest report from Jefferies Financial Group Inc., citing EPFR data. For Asia, equity funds saw $1.9 billion in outflows for that time frame.

Sovereign bonds fell.
The SSE (LON:SSE) 50 Index of some of China’s biggest stocks rose 2.2 percent as of 9:56 a.m. in Shanghai. New China Life Insurance Co. climbed 5.9 percent, in line for the biggest gain since Feb. 25, as insurers and banks advanced. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 1.7 percent to extend its gain from a low in early January to 20 percent.
Investors were content to take profits last week from the best-performing stocks in the world in 2019. After trading ended for the week, the People’s Bank of China released credit data that suggested growth exceeded all estimates in March. Risk sentiment is also being boosted by signs the U.S. and China are nearing a trade deal after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. is open to facing “repercussions” if it doesn’t live up to its commitments.
""The credit data lifted expectations on market liquidity and economic fundamentals,"" said Wang Jianhui, a Beijing-based analyst with Capital Securities Co. ""It provided an excuse for investors who wanted to bottom fish stocks after last week’s correction.""
The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds rose 4 basis points to 3.40 percent, the highest since December. The yield has climbed 12 basis points in the past two sessions.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both rose 1.8% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 1.2%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.3%, while South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.7%.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to impose levies of as much as 25% on all imported cars, including those made in Japan.
“Japan is now negotiating,” Trump told reporters. “They haven’t wanted to negotiate for many years, but now they’re negotiating. It’s called ‘tariffs.’”
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 edged down 0.1%.
The release of China’s trade and credit data on Friday, which was better than expected, eased concerns about a global economic growth slowdown and provided some support to Asian equities.
The data came a couple of days after the International Monetary Fund slashed its global economic growth forecast for 2019.
Meanwhile, positive developments in the Sino-U.S. trade talks also lifted investor sentiment.
It was reported last week that the two sides have agreed on an enforcement mechanism to police any trade deal they agree on in the future.
“There are certain commitments that the United States is making in this agreement, and there are certain commitments that China is making,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Saturday at the IMF meetings in Washington.
“I would expect that the enforcement mechanism works in both directions, that we expect to honor our commitments, and if we don’t, there should be certain repercussions, and the same way in the other direction,” he said, adding that the two countries are considering to hold more in-person meetings."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to build a fully electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) for China from 2021, taking on the Chinese market leader Tesla's Model X as the German carmaker ramps up production of zero emissions vehicles.
The planned new SUV is the latest move in Volkswagen's aggressive growth strategy in China, where electric cars are given preferential treatment by authorities.
VW said its ID ROOMZZ, which it presented in Shanghai on Sunday, will have three rows of seats and an operating range of up to 450 kms. The concept car is capable of a ""level 4 autonomous driving"", VW said.
VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess said the ID ROOMZ will be the flagship electric car to be launched by Volkswagen in China.
""We plan to produce more than 22 million electric cars in the next 10 years,"" Diess said, adding that around half of VW’s engineers were working on products destined for China.

PARIS (Reuters) - Publicis will pay $4.4 billion to acquire Alliance Data's Epsilon marketing unit, the French advertising group said on Sunday, expanding its digital business and North American footprint.
The deal, announced two weeks after Publicis confirmed it was in talks with Alliance Data, bolsters efforts by the world's third-ranked advertiser to adapt to a fast-changing market increasingly driven by online client data.
""The addition of Epsilon will propel Publicis as a leader of data-driven personalized experiences at scale,"" the Paris-based company said in a statement outlining its biggest ever acquisition - which tops the 3.7 billion euros ($4.18 billion) paid for tech consulting firm Sapient in 2014.
Publicis and other traditional advertisers have lost ground in a marketplace increasingly dominated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and digital marketing specialists that track and target individual clients via their smartphones, while navigating tougher data-protection laws.
The French group's shares sagged after a fourth-quarter earnings miss and have fallen 15 percent in total over the past 12 months.
The Epsilon purchase is ""a very significant investment for a company of our size"", Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said. ""But we're convinced it's the right move ... in a world where data is at the heart of all decisions and the mobile phone has become our main interface.""
Epsilon, which brings a data trove on some 160 million individual clients, generated revenue of $1.9 billion last year, almost entirely in the United States.
The $4.4 billion cash price amounts to $3.95 billion excluding tax, or 8.2 times Epsilon's 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Publicis said.
The French company said it would cancel a previously announced share buyback and finance the Epsilon deal with debt, adding that the acquisition would boost earnings and cash flow by at least 10 percent, starting next year. 
January-March revenue came in at 2.12 billion euros, Publicis said, releasing quarterly sales ahead of the April 17 scheduled disclosure date. The sales were down 1.6 percent on a like-for-like basis but up 1.7 percent as reported.
The company said the decline in ad spending should ease in the second half, reiterating 2019 guidance including higher sales growth and profitability, and a 5-10 percent increase in recurring earnings per share excluding currency effects.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2019 07:41AM ET</span>","Over 1,000 Jet Airways pilots not to fly from Monday due to unpaid salaries","By Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than a thousand pilots of India's debt-laden Jet Airways will not fly from Monday as they have not been paid salaries for the past three months, the President of the National Aviators Guild said on Sunday.
Saddled with more than $1.2 billion of bank debt, the airline has been teetering for weeks and has yet to receive a loan of about $217 million from its lenders as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.
""Pilots haven't been paid for the last three months,"" Capt Karan Chopra told Reuters.
The crisis at Jet has deepened in recent weeks as lessors have started applying to deregister planes, signalling the planned bailout had failed to assuage their concerns.
An urgent meeting to discuss the Jet situation was held at the prime minister's office on Friday, which was also attended by the country's aviation secretary, Pradeep Singh Kharola.
After the meeting, Kharola said the carrier had money to operate 6-7 planes over the weekend and after that the lenders would have to decide how many jets it could fly after Monday afternoon, news channel ET Now reported late on Friday.
Kharola said the company will meet bankers on Monday for an infusion of funds in the interim, the TV channel said.
According to a Business Standard newspaper report on Sunday, Jet's lenders, led by the State Bank of India, are considering a proposal to infuse 10 billion rupees ($144.55 million) to keep the airline afloat.
The money is expected to be disbursed after the Jet management submits an operational plan on how it intends to use the money till May 7, the report said. 
An SBI spokesman could not immediately comment on the emergency funding being considered by lenders for Jet Airways.
The lenders, who have been seeking a new investor to take a stake of up to 75 percent in the airline, hope to complete the selection of bidders by May 7.
Initial bids were to be submitted by the end April 10, but SBI extended the deadline to April 12.

Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, which owns a 24-percent stake in the airline, private equity fund TPG Capital, the government-owned sovereign fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and ousted chairman Naresh Goyal are among those to have submitted bids, the Business Standard reported.

A spokesman for Daimler, owner of Mercedes-Benz, said the carmaker was reviewing the facts and fully cooperating with the KBA.
Bild am Sonntag said the KBA was looking into suspicious software in Mercedes-Benz GLK 220 CDI cars produced between 2012 and 2015, after tests showed they only meet emissions limits when a certain function is activated.
Since rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, the scandal has spread to other carmakers. Daimler has ordered the recall of 3 million vehicles to fix excess emissions coming from their diesel engines.
Bild am Sonntag said the KBA found that the function it had discovered had been removed during software updates carried out by Daimler.
The Daimler spokesman said the company had complied with a process agreed upon with the KBA and German Transport Ministry when updating software for the 3 million recalled vehicles.
""The allegation that we wanted to hide something with the voluntary service measure is incorrect,"" he said.

This month European Union antitrust regulators charged BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen with colluding to block the rollout of emissions-cleaning technology.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Richard Liu, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com Inc, has weighed in on an ongoing debate about the Chinese tech industry's grueling overtime work culture, lamenting that years of growth had increased the number of ""slackers"" in his firm who are not his ""brothers."" 
Liu's comments, which Chinese media said were posted on his personal WeChat feed on Friday, are the latest contribution to a growing discussion about work-life balance in the tech industry as the sector slows after years of breakneck growth. 
They also come amid reports this week that the company is in the throes of widespread layoffs. Three company sources told Reuters that cuts began earlier this year and had become more extensive in recent weeks.
A JD.com spokesman confirmed the authenticity of Liu's note. He declined to comment on layoffs but said some adjustments were happening as a normal part of business.
""JD.com is a competitive workplace that rewards initiative and hard work, which is consistent with our entrepreneurial roots,"" the spokesman said. ""We're getting back to those roots as we seek, develop and reward staff who share the same hunger and values.""
Liu, who started the company that would become JD.com in 1998, in the note spoke about how in the firm's earliest days he would set his alarm clock to wake him up every two hours to ensure he could offer his customers 24-hour service - a step he said was crucial to JD's success.
""JD in the last four, five years has not made any eliminations, so the number of staff has expanded rapidly, the number of people giving orders has grown and grown, while the those who are working have fallen,"" Liu wrote. ""Instead, the number of slackers has rapidly grown!"" 
""If this carries on, JD will have no hope! And the company will only be heartlessly kicked out of the market! Slackers are not my brothers!"" he added
The term he used, which is commonly translated in China as ""slackers"" can be directly translated as people who drift along aimlessly or waste time. 
The contents of his note were reported by major Chinese media outlets such as financial magazine Caijing and the 21st Century Herald newspaper on Saturday as well as widely shared on Twitter-like platform Weibo, where it was read more than 400 million times. 
CUTS AND SLOWDOWN
Three JD employees, who declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to the media, told Reuters that morale at the company was low after several senior executive departures and layoffs across the firm in recent weeks. One said the cuts also affected vice-president level staff. 
Tech website The Information reported this week that JD.com could cut up to 8 percent of its workforce. JD, which had more than 178,000 full-time employees at the end of last year, said the figure was incorrect.
""Now is kind of an inflection point, where too many people and too many business leaders or department leaders have been laid off. No one is safe,"" one of the sources said.
He added that it had affected productivity in his department and that many workers checked Weibo, the stock markets or played games rather than focus on work.
The layoffs ""are pretty much all JD employees can talk about,"" he said.
The JD spokesman, when asked about morale, said most of the team was highly committed.
""Change - while uncomfortable for some - can be encouraging for most, who are dedicated to our shared future.""
JD, which is backed by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and China's Tencent Holdings, in February posted its lowest quarterly revenue growth rate since its 2015 initial public offering.
Other Chinese tech giants have lowered growth forecasts and cut staff bonuses amid the slowdown, which has driven calls for better work conditions for its workers. 
The '996' work schedule, which refers to a 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. workday, six days a week, has in particular become the target of online debate and protests on some coding platforms, where workers have swapped examples of excessive overtime demands at some firms. 
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group founder and billionaire Jack Ma also weighed in on Friday, telling the company's employees in a speech that the opportunity to work such hours was a ""blessing"".
Liu said JD did not force its staff to work the ""996"" or even a ""995"" overtime schedule. 

""But every person must have the desire to push oneself to the limit!"" he said.

Speaking at a summit between China and Central and Eastern European countries in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, Li listed several positive indicators of economic activity and pledged to continue policies to help support growth. 
Li said China would maintain the direction of its macroeconomic policies but would not move toward quantitative easing or flood the economy with bank bills.

903,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",Industrials' gains put to test as earnings ramp up,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors betting on industrial stocks this year have been rewarded, with the group among the best-performing sectors so far, but that strength will be tested in the coming weeks as companies report results.
Industrials have outperformed the broader market this year, thanks in part to optimism that the United States may soon have a trade deal with China, as well as expectations the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again any time soon.
As first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies ramp up, investors will hear from Honeywell International (NYSE:HON),  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP). and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) next week. 
The S&P 500 industrials index is up more than 19% for the year so far, compared with a roughly 15% gain in the S&P 500.
While industrial stocks and the rest of the market have risen on hopes that a China trade deal is near, executives have warned about the conflict's impact, with the industrials space seen as one of the most sensitive. 
Costs for certain raw materials have increased as the United States imposed tariffs on imports from China and other countries. 
Investors will likely hear more this earnings period about the effects of the tariffs, and weakness in China and the rest of the global economy, on U.S. companies.
""Industrials and tech have been two of the sectors that have called out the risks from trade frequently on earnings calls,"" said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
""Some of them have seen valuations or estimates come down substantially on those risks."" Because of that, industrial companies could have further to gain if there is a trade deal or any reversal to existing tariffs, she said. The bank has an overweight rating on industrials this year.
The sector has continued to outperform even with problems for one of its leaders. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares were pummeled last month after its popular 737 MAX jet was involved in a second fatal crash and the aircraft was grounded worldwide.
Results and comments from Boeing, airlines and aerospace suppliers also are likely to generate investor attention.
Wall Street analysts have been trying to gauge the financial hit to Boeing since the March deadly plane crash in Ethiopia.
At the same time, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co has cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service, and United Airlines has said it would see an adverse effect on its operations if the jets remained grounded heading into the peak summer travel season.
""There's certainly risk at companies that sell into Boeing planes, although what we're hearing is Boeing hasn't so far cut back on any supplier orders. That could be in second-quarter forecasts,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Boeing's results are due April 24.  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and other aerospace and defense names are due the same week.
Those bullish on the industrials sector also argue that its valuation remains attractive despite this year's strong gains.
The S&P 500 industrial index is trading at 15.9 times forward 12-month earnings, still among the lowest of the 11 S&P sector and below the benchmark S&P 500's 16.8 price-to-earnings ratio, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
First-quarter earnings for the sector are expected to have increased just 1.6% from a year earlier, though that's better than the expected 2.3% decline in overall S&P 500 earnings, based on Refinitiv's data. 
Analysts see  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. as the largest drag on the industrials sector's first-quarter earnings, based on Refinitiv's data. If GE's results are removed, the sector's earnings are expected to have increased 4.0%. GE is due to report April 30.

Year-over-year quarterly revenue for industrials is forecast to have gained 2.9% versus a 4.9% increase expected for the S&P 500.

904,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2019 04:02AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Not All Yield Curve Inversions Are Created Equal
To many, an inverted yield curve is taken as gospel of economic doom and gloom, having preceded every recession over the past four decades. But some question whether shorter-term rates rising faster than longer-term rates (an inverted yield curve) carries the harrowing threat it once did.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard certainly thinks it does.
In a speech in Mississippi earlier this week, Bullard argued a ""meaningful and sustained inversion of the Treasury yield curve would be a bearish signal for the U.S. economy.""
An inversion would suggest that financial markets expect less inflation and less growth ahead for the U.S. economy than does the FOMC, he added.
Bullard's comments are hardly a new take on the implication of an inverted yield curve - far from it - but they are somewhat out of kilter with those of his colleagues.
In typical Fed speak, members said that the ""unusually low level of term premiums in longer-term interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the recent behavior of the yield curve,"" according to the minutes of Fed's March meeting released Wednesday.
The Fed ranks high on the list of suspects culpable for the low level of term premium, which is what investors get for holding a longer-term bond over a shorter-term one.
At the height of the Financial Crisis, the Fed's main tool, its benchmark rate, ran out of road after rates were slashed to zero. So, the Fed hatched a plan to buy longer-dated bonds in an effort to jumpstart credit markets and the broader economy.
With its printing press, or QE program, in full flow, the Fed, during a five-year stint, was the only game in town at the longer end of the curve. It ramped up purchases of Treasuries, ushering in an era of unusually low yields in longer-term bonds.
The Fed's meddling in the bond market led many to believe that the Treasury curve's prophetic powers are not as strong as they were. In the face of an inverted yield curve, therefore, some are quick to say ""this time it's different"" and an imminent recession is unlikely.
Bullard's New York counterpart John Williams agrees with that assessment. Earlier this week, he said the flattening yield curve is not signaling a recession, as its reputation for predicting downturns may be weaker in the current era of unconventional monetary policy.
But for all the hoopla that comes with an inverted yield curve, most agree that a prolonged inversion, with or without the Fed's intervention, is something to worry about.
2. Gasoline Is Fueling Inflation
The headline for this week’s retail inflation numbers was that consumer prices were well contained. That’s because the market focuses on the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes food and energy prices due to their volatility.
The core CPI rose 0.1% in March, less the than 0.2% rise economists forecast, according to compilations by Investing.com. The annual rise in core CPI came in at 2%, below expectations of 2.1%.
The core number gets all the attention no just because it smooths out the data, but because the Federal Reserve really loves core inflation. It tends to favor the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, but the core CPI is also in its sights.
But those looking at the core numbers might have missed the big reason why the full CPI rose 0.4%, more than expected: gas prices.
Gas was responsible for 60% of the increase in March total prices. And there are signs this week that’ll keep getting worse.
On Wednesday the Energy Information Administration said gasoline inventories plunged by more than 7 million barrels, more than expected, sending gasoline futures up more than 3% for the day. Futures are up more than 30% year to date.
Retail gasoline prices are higher, too. AAA's daily survey of retail gas prices put the U.S. national average at $2.761 a gallon, up nearly 22% for the year.
That not only means higher input costs for lots of companies and less spending power for U.S. drivers. It could have an impact on the Fed in the future, despite its dedication to the core.
Trump Fed nominee Stephen Moore “has argued that the Fed should base its decisions on shifts in commodity prices,” GrantThornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk wrote in a note this week.
But Swonk also said Moore looks like he’s already changed his tune.
“He was using a sustained drop in prices to justify a rate cut a few months ago,” she said. “One would assume higher prices at the pump would change his position; it has not.”
3. Will AI Discriminate?
The World Economic Forum tweeted out an article on gender inequality that featured a fascinating chart on the perceptions of C-suite diversity.



The chart, which comes from Statista, shows that people across the globe vastly overestimate the proportion of CEOs who are women.
According to the chart, while just 3% of the top 500 global companies have female chief executives, those surveyed worldwide thought the percentage was much higher.
Mexico overestimated the most, guessing 29% of CEOs were women, while Brazil and India both thought it was more than 20%.
At the other end of the spectrum, South Korea was closer with an estimate of 9%, while Australia and the U.K. went for 12%.
This is already important for the market, as companies may not feel the need to press for diversity (which can improve results) if the consensus is that representation of women at the top is at a much higher level.
But the WEF takes it further in its article, postulating that artificial intelligence could exacerbate these mistaken assumptions and increase gender inequality.
“With the rapid deployment of AI, this biased data will influence the predictions that machines make,” Bettina Buchel, professor of strategy and organization at IMD Business School, wrote. “Whenever you have a dataset of human decisions, it naturally includes bias.”
Any journalist who’s had to find an image for a story by searching for “CEO” (the most basic of algorithms) will know what gender will dominate the results.
AI is definitely one of the buzzwords the market likes to hear companies tout in their R&D plans (often no matter what the sector). But investors may want to dig a little deeper into how the companies plan to deploy those research dollars and what datasets they are relying on.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2019 02:36AM ET</span>","FAA meets with U.S. airlines, pilot unions on Boeing 737 MAX","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski 
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration met for three hours on Friday with representatives from the three major U.S. airlines that own now grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets and their pilots' unions to discuss two fatal crashes and the path forward.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAXs have been grounded worldwide after a total of 346 people died in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October and in an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa last month.
American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co officials attended the meeting, where FAA Acting Administrator Dan Elwell said he wanted to know operators' and pilots' thoughts before the agency decides to return the 737 MAX to service.
Elwell said the meeting participants' ""operational perspective is critical input as the agency welcomes scrutiny on how it can do better.""
American said in a statement it was ""confident in the direction the FAA is heading"" and would continue to work collaboratively in this process.
Pilots from American and Southwest, the two largest U.S. MAX operators, said they welcomed the meeting but noted that many issues still needed to be discussed and debated before the MAX flies again.
""We have to unground the confidence in this airplane,"" Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association which represents American's pilots, told reporters outside FAA headquarters.
""We take off our watches and put the calendars in the drawer,"" he added, suggesting that rebuilding confidence in the aircraft could take some time.
American and United have removed the 737 MAX from their schedules through early June, while Southwest on Thursday extended the removal of its 34 MAX jets through Aug. 5, leading to around 160 daily flight cancellations during the revised summer schedule.
Boeing is reprogramming software on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system known as MCAS that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.
The FAA said the meeting covered a review of the preliminary findings of the two crash investigations and an overview of Boeing's anticipated software enhancements and pilot training. 
The plane's certification and training have been questioned following a 2004 decision by Congress to allow manufacturers an expanded role in the FAA's aircraft oversight. 
Captain Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a letter he was concerned that this concept ""may be too ingrained to reverse"" and complicated by federal budget and personnel shortfalls, but called for continued scrutiny of Boeing.
The FAA has convened a joint review with aviation regulators from China, Europe, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Ethiopia and other countries.
Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department inspector general’s office and a blue-ribbon panel are also reviewing the plane’s certification.

""The first and most important goal of all of the entire process should be to protect the lives of our passengers and the traveling public in general,"" said Weaks.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Avianca Brasil on Friday canceled 179 flights scheduled for the next five days after a judge denied an appeal by the carrier to hold on to nine disputed planes, marking the unraveling of the airline four months after it filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Avianca Brasil was operating with 35 planes, a representative said, but a federal judge late on Friday ordered the return of nine planes ""immediately,"" denying the carrier's last-minute appeal, according to a news release by the Brazilian court. 
Lessor Aircastle was scheduled to repossess its remaining nine planes leased to Avianca Brasil by Sunday, Brazil's civil aviation regulator said. 
The vast majority of the airline's 179 cancellations so far are scheduled to take place between Monday and Wednesday and include some flights between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, by far Brazil's most popular route. 
For months, Avianca Brasil managed to hold on to its fleet despite continuing to miss lease payments, as judges repeatedly ruled that the carrier should be able to keep operating the planes until a creditor meeting could define the fate of the enterprise. 
The creditors meeting took place last week, lifting that restriction. Creditors approved the auction of most of Avianca's assets. 
Another lessor, Aviation Capital Group, which is owned by Pacific Life Insurance also received a favorable decision earlier this week to repossess nine planes, and has already taken three.

Avianca Brasil is separate from the better-known Avianca Holdings SA , which is based in Colombia, although both airlines share a corporate parent.

The creation of a fund that would allow utilities to pay for wildfire damage claims sent PG&E Corp shares soaring nearly 12 percent before closing 3.95 percent higher on Friday.
""PG&E is a textbook example of what happens when a utility does not invest in safety after numerous deadly reminders to do so over many years,"" a report released by Newsom said.
PG&E said in a statement that it is ""embracing the calls for change,"" and committed to resolving wildfire victims' claims fairly and expeditiously.
Newsom's report calls for shifting liability for wildfire damage to a fault-based system. The current system, known as inverse condemnation, exposes the state's utilities to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. 
The current system pushed PG&E to seek bankruptcy protection in January, as it faced liabilities in excess of $30 billion related to the deadliest wildfires in the state's history.
SPREAD THE COSTS
The governor's report proposed creating two funds to help utilities pay for wildfire damage claims and spread the cost more widely among stakeholders.
Another large utility, Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison Co, said in a statement that it ""is encouraged by the broad scope"" of Newsom's report, ""which reflects the need to address wildfire liability and regulatory reform.""
Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX), the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose 7.2 percent. 
Travis Miller of Morningstar Research Services LLC said the news was positive for shareholders, though there is ""a long road ahead to implementing policies.” The government's support for the utilities “should alleviate some of the market’s concerns about future liabilities,” he said.
The report was harshly critical of PG&E, saying it is ""taking advantage of the bankruptcy process to promote the interests of investors over fire victims and other stakeholders.""
The state will monitor and intervene in the bankruptcy proceedings to protect California's interests, it said.
FEDERAL FOREST LANDS
Damage estimates for the 2018 wildfire season are staggering, with insured losses alone exceeding $12 billion, the report said.
""The current system for allocating costs associated with catastrophic wildfires - often caused by utility infrastructure, but exacerbated by drought, climate change, land-use policies and a lack of forest management - is untenable both for utility customers and for our economy,"" the report said.
It calls on the federal government to better manage its forests, as the owner of 57 percent of California's forest lands.
President Donald Trump in January threatened to cut off federal relief to California for wildfires for what he called mismanagement of the state's forests.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing assistance to survivors after wildfires in November collectively damaged or destroyed over 20,000 structures and killed at least 89 people. 
The largest blaze was the Camp Fire that destroyed most of the Northern California town of Paradise, killing at least 86 people - the deadliest wildfire in the United States in at least a century.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.03%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.66%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.46%.
The S&P 500 ended the day just 1.1% below its all-time high of 2,940.91, reached on Sept. 21, 2018. The Dow is within 2% of its 2018 peak, and the Nasdaq is 1.8% below its 2018 peak.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) got the earnings season underway on a good note, beating the consensus from Investing.com on the both the top and bottom lines. Its share price rose 4.6%.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) fell 2.6% as its above-consensus earnings was overshadowed by a weakness in its consumer lending business. Investors also had to contend with more bad news. Interim CEO Allen Parker downgraded the bank's outlook on net interest income to range of -2% to -5% from a -2% to 2% range previously, citing a lower absolute rate outlook, a flatter curve and tightening loan spreads.
PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC), meanwhile, delivered in-line earnings and a revenue beat, sending its share more than 3% higher.
With many fearing the first-quarter earnings would prove one of the most challenging in years, the mostly upbeat results appeared to cast aside some of the doubt.
Beyond earnings, Disney (NYSE:DIS) also powered the rally in the broader market, surging 11.5% after the company gave details late Thursday on its new streaming service, Disney+. Disney also hit a 52-week and all-time high of $130.90, and the stock contributed 91 points to the Dow's 269-point gain.
The service isn't likely to turn a profit for at least five years and will be priced at $7.99 per month/$69.99 per year, with two-thirds of the sales of the service expected to come from overseas markets, according to Disney.
That subscription price is well below that of rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which crumbled in the shadow of Disney, down nearly 4.5% on the day.
Swashbuckling gains were not on display in all corners of the markets as energy stocks lagged the move the higher, rising just 0.18% as U.S. oil prices gave up some gains following an uptick in rig counts.

Health care stocks, meanwhile, ended the day down nearly 1% as ongoing uncertainty about the fate of the Affordable Care Act and fears lawmakers may impose measures to curb drug prices continue to stifle the sector.
On the economic front, weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment data had a muted impact on stocks.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 04:42PM ET</span>",S&P 500 closes near record high as earnings season begins in earnest,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed near record highs on Friday after the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), soothed worries that the first-quarter earnings season would dampen Wall Street's big rally back from last year's slump.
The S&P 500 is now within a percent of September's record closing high, and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes reinvested dividends, in fact regained record levels, recovering ground lost after a punishing sell-off in the closing months of the year which brought the benchmark index within a rounding error of bear market territory.
Since then, the three major indexes notched their best quarterly gains in nearly a decade in the first quarter, but have spent April in a holding pattern ahead of first-quarter earnings season. 
JPMorgan, effectively jump-starting the quarterly earnings reporting season that will dominate investor sentiment in coming weeks, blew past analyst estimates, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results. Its stock rose 4.7% and led a broad rally in bank stocks.
""JPMorgan earnings are important because their operation touches on a wide portion of the economy,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""It's a bellwether for other corporate earnings."" 
Analyst now expect S&P 500 companies to show a 2.3% year-on-year decline in earnings, slightly improved from their last reading, per Refinitiv data. But first-quarter profit is still seen logging its first annual contraction since 2016. 
However, of the 29 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported thus far, 79.3% have come in above analyst expectations.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co jumped 11.5% to an all-time high, providing the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500 after pricing its upcoming streaming service.
Streaming rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) slid 4.5%. 
The Nasdaq and the Dow are both about 1.5% below their previous record highs. 
For the week, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq showed their third straight gains, while the Dow posted a nominal weekly loss.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 269.25 points, or 1.03%, to 26,412.3, the S&P 500 gained 19.09 points, or 0.66%, to 2,907.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.81 points, or 0.46%, to 7,984.16.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare ended the session in positive territory.
Financials were the largest percentage gainer, rising 1.9% on the back of JPMorgan Chase earnings. 
Healthcare stocks extended their slide, with UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) down 5.2%, Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc dropping 8.5% and  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) off 2.8%. The S&P 500 Healthcare index slipped 1.0%. 
In the largest energy deal since 2016,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) said it would buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) for $33 billion in cash and stock.
Chevron's stock dipped by 4.9% following the announcement, while Anadarko shot up 32.0%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 2.6% as the plane maker's stock recovered ground following its recent sell-off. 
The CBOE Volatility Index - Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge"" slipped to a fresh six-month low on Friday, in a sign investors expect the good times to keep rolling.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 60 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 38 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.75 billion shares, compared to the 6.97 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Campbell bought Bolthouse, known for its fruit juices and packaged carrots, in 2012 for about $1.55 billion in a push to add healthier products to its portfolio.
The business, however, has struggled in recent years, with issues ranging from farming missteps to the recall of 3.8 million bottles of protein shakes due to possible spoilage.
The fresh food unit along with Campbell's international business, has been up for sale since August after the company was pressured by investors to boost its profitability and stock performance.
""The sale of Bolthouse Farms supports our strategy to focus on our two core North American businesses, Campbell Snacks and Campbell Meals and Beverages,"" CEO Mark Clouse said. 
The packaged foods maker said the proceeds from deal would help reduce debt by about $570 million and that the transaction is not expected to impact the company's fiscal 2019 forecast.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 02:32PM ET</span>",GE to pay $1.5 billion U.S. fine over crisis-era subprime mortgages,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co will pay a $1.5 billion civil fine to resolve a long-running U.S. probe into defective subprime mortgages from its former WMC Mortgage unit prior to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday said the accord resolves claims that GE concealed the poor quality of the loans and WMC's lax fraud controls when packaging the loans into residential mortgage-backed securities sold to investors.
GE did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.
WMC was acquired by GE's finance unit, General Electric Capital Corp, in 2004, and originated more than $65 billion of mortgage loans in the next three years.
The Justice Department said WMC overstated the quality of a majority of loans it packaged into residential mortgage-backed securities, and its fraudulent practices resulted in billions of dollars of investor losses.
Boston-based GE in January had announced an agreement in principle for the settlement and already set aside $1.5 billion. GE sold WMC in late 2007.
""This is another step in our ongoing efforts to de-risk GE Capital,"" GE said in a statement. ""This agreement represents a significant part of the total legacy exposure associated with WMC and we are pleased to put this matter behind us.""
The settlement is part of the efforts by Chief Executive Larry Culp, who took over GE's top job at the beginning of October, to reduce liabilities incurred through expansion by his predecessors, as he attempts to improve profitability and cash flow at GE's core industrial operations.
Other large lenders including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) have also settled U.S. mortgage securities claims.
The Swiss bank UBS Group AG is defending against similar claims in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.
GE's case resolved claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, a 1989 law arising from that decade's savings-and-loan scandals. The law has a 10-year statute of limitations.
GE's shares were down 0.9 percent at $9.04 in afternoon trading on Friday.

In November 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury ranked WMC fourth on a list https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2009/nr-occ-2009-112b.pdf of ""worst subprime originators,"" based on how its loans fared in metropolitan areas with high foreclosure rates, including Detroit, Cleveland and Stockton, California.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",Meditate to the tax finish line,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK(Reuters) - Stressed out by the tax deadline on April 15?
Yes, of course, there is an app for that.
Some 52 percent of Americans find the filing process stressful, according to a survey by tax-prep firm TaxSlayer. That is why wellness app Headspace is trying to talk us through this difficult time with a new guided meditation collection called “Money on the Mind.” 
The popular app Happify also features two different four-week programs, or ""tracks,"" on money: ""Stop Singing the Financial Blues,"" and ""How Money Can Buy Happiness.""
Around tax time last year, users clicked on Headspace's ""Balance"" collection five times more than usual. And for its ""Money on the Mind"" collection of meditations, usage of that content spiked by 60 percent. 
This April, Headspace is making some of its money-related content free to all its 45 million members. More content is available to paying subscribers.
""These moments are triggers for stress, and so our users come to us for support about how to cope,"" said Megan Jones Bell, Headspace’s chief science officer.
Some 20 to 25 percent of Americans wait until the final few weeks before the deadline to file their returns, according to a survey by tax-software firm TurboTax, a division of  Intuit  Inc (NASDAQ:INTU). 
And for those who are not able to sign on the dotted line in time, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is projecting almost 15 million extension requests this year.
If you are up against the deadline and need to clear your head, consider these tips:
* Carve out time.
Wellness apps like Headspace use a combination of guided meditation, advice and courses to help users free their minds. It can feel counterintuitive that just sitting and breathing is going to help you with the 100 different tasks that need to be accomplished to complete your tax return. 
But carve some space for this into your day and build it into your routine or it will not get done.
Bell suggests logging on in the morning, when new habits have a better chance of taking root and being sustained. The best results in stress reduction and resilience come when you are going through these mental exercises multiple times a week.
* Keep at it.
A one-off meditation session probably is not going to do you a whole lot of good, especially if you have a whopping tax bill due. But continue the habit for a while.
Jacquette Timmons, a New York City-based financial behaviorist and author of ""Financial Intimacy,"" suggests giving yourself 30 days - and meditating more often than not - to see how your mind and body react to the practice. 
Timmons herself meditates around five times per week.
Using tools like these for 10 days, for instance, results in a 14 percent decrease in stress, according to published Headspace studies. Make it to 60 days, and you are up to a 17 percent stress reduction.
* Confront, do not avoid.
Mindfulness tools are not meant as a form of escapism, to let you float away from all your worries. After all, taxes are still due on April 15, no matter how chill you are.
But they are meant to make your mind and emotions more resilient, so that you can address the root problem without freaking out about it.
Do not expect any magical outcomes for your tax worries, but the practice can get you in the right frame of mind to deal with Uncle Sam.

""I think this can help people,"" Timmons said. ""Not every meditation is going to bring you an 'A-ha moment,' but if you do it cumulatively, it will give you some clarity of mind.""

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) agreed to pay $65 per Anadarko (NYSE:APC) share in stock and cash, sending Anadarko's shares up nearly 33%. The merger will create an oil-production powerhouse boasting a total enterprise value of about $50 billion.
Chevron said the deal would enhance its upstream portfolio and strengthen its positions in large shale, deepwater and natural-gas basins.
The merger, expected to close in the second half of the year, will achieve $1 billion in run-rate cost synergies and $1 billion in capital spending cuts within a year of closing, according to the companies.
Shareholders are also set to receive a large windfall, as Chevron plans to ramp up its share-repurchase program to $5 billion from $4 billion after the merger is completed.
Chevron was not the only suitor with eyes on Anadarko.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) had offered $70 per share in cash and stock, CNBC reported, citing unnamed sources. Occidental may turn its attention to other Permian major shale players now.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD),  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE) and Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO), major Permian shale companies, rallied on news of the deal."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's better-than-expected first-quarter earnings raised expectations that rival Wall Street lenders would follow suit when they report next week, pushing most bank stocks higher on Friday.
Shares in JPMorgan jumped as much as 4.7 percent in morning trading, touching a more than four-month high before paring some gains.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) shares were up 3.8 percent and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) rose 2.8 percent.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) shares both climbed 2 percent.
JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets and a bellwether for the U.S economy and financial sector. It reported strong results across its businesses, with Chief Executive Jamie Dimon citing solid U.S. economic growth, moderate inflation and robust consumer and business confidence.
Even a 10 percent fall in JPMorgan's trading revenue from a year earlier was viewed as boding well for others, since analysts had been bracing for a bigger drop in fixed-income and equities trading. 
""JPMorgan had a positive read-across for trading results in the quarter,"" said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. ""We believe FICC (fixed income, commodities and currencies) trading should be a positive read-across to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.""
Bank stock investors appeared to zero in on JPMorgan and ignore  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the other big bank that reported on Friday. 
Wells Fargo reported higher first-quarter earnings but lowered its forecast for net interest income this year, a move that sent its shares tumbling as much as 3 percent.
U.S. bank stocks had underperformed in recent months as economists and investors fixated on a flattening yield curve, normally the precursor to a recession. Bank executives have downplayed those concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth in the first quarter of 2019.

Since the start of December, the S&P 500 financial sector is up 0.3 percent, while the overall S&P 500 is up 5 percent. The S&P 500 banks index fell 2.5 percent over the same period. Brushing aside global economic concerns such as Brexit and U.S.-China trade tensions, JPMorgan's Dimon said the U.S. economy ""continues to grow, employment and wages are going up, inflation is moderate, financial markets are healthy and consumer and business confidence remains strong.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's shareholders voted to approve the drugmaker's $74 billion acquisition of biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) on Friday despite a campaign by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP to scuttle the deal.
The company said investors holding 75.7 percent of the shares voted were in favor of the deal in a preliminary count.
""We, from a management perspective, from a board perspective, truly believe this is the right transaction for us,"" Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio told reporters after the vote. 
""The focus is on us right now to execute on the integration and then deliver the value of the combined portfolio, to confirm that the new company will deliver significant value for shareholders,"" he said.
Celgene said separately in a statement that its shareholders representing more than 70 percent of its shares outstanding who were entitled to vote, voted in favor of the transaction.
The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter.
Bristol-Myers announced in early January that it planned to buy Celgene in a cash and stock transaction to bring together companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in what would be the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever.
The New York-based drugmaker has said the combined company will have six drugs with expected near-term launches - five from the Celgene pipeline - representing over $15 billion in annual revenue potential - as well as strong early-stage experimental assets.
But Starboard and the company's second largest shareholder, Wellington Management, opposed the deal. 
Starboard called it ""poorly conceived and ill-advised,"" and criticized Bristol-Myers' management and board, suggesting they would not be able to successfully execute a risky deal.
Starboard abandoned the campaign against the deal late last month after proxy advisory firms recommended investors support it. 
Bristol-Myers said during a shareholders meeting that it does not expect changes to its dividend policy after the acquisition.

Bristol-Myers shares fell 50 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $45.59 in Friday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Celgene shares fell 9 cents to $94.14 on the Nasdaq.

Netflix's shares fell about 4 percent after Disney priced its streaming service, Disney+, at $6.99 per month, below the video streaming pioneer's basic plan of $8.99.
""Investors find a lot of promise in Disney's offerings because it's well positioned to fight the likes of Netflix for consumers' money,"" said Clement Thibault, analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.
Shares of Disney jumped 10 percent to $128.26, adding $21 billion to the company's market capitalization of $209 billion on Thursday.
J.P. Morgan analysts also noted that Disney+'s interface appears similar to that of Netflix with personalization of user profiles, recommended content, search capabilities and parental controls.
Disney+ will launch on Nov. 12 in the United States, featuring content from a host of Disney brands including Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar as well as recently acquired Fox properties such as ""The Simpsons"" and National Geographic programming.
Disney said it expects to attract between 60 million and 90 million subscribers and achieve profitability in fiscal year 2024. It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.

""It's still very early on, but the streaming war has officially begun. By fighting back with a competitive offering, Disney at least gives itself a chance to win in the streaming industry, rather than just losing user after user to other streaming services,"" Thibault said.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>","Chevron to buy Anadarko for $33 billion in shale, LNG push","By John Benny and Jennifer Hiller
(Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Friday said it will buy oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) for $33 billion in cash and stock in a deal that doubles down on its bet on U.S. shale and LNG as U.S. energy production is shattering records.
The deal makes Chevron the second-largest major by crude production, behind  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), up from fourth. It expands Chevron's reach in two areas where U.S. energy output is surging - shale from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) - which have helped make the U.S. one of the world's largest energy exporters. 
“Chevron now joins the ranks of the 'ultramajors' – and the big three becomes the big four,"" said Roy Martin, senior analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. ""The acquisition makes the majors’ peer group much more polarized. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell (LON:RDSa) and  BP  (LON:BP) are now in a league of their own.""
U.S. crude production stands at a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), and the nation is the third-largest producer of LNG, the super-cooled fuel that is seeing record demand as a cheaper, cleaner alternative for countries that still rely heavily on coal for power generation. 
The combined companies are expected to produce more than 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the United States this year, according to Wood Mackenzie.
Chevron's pledge to restrain expenditures has make it a favorite among energy stocks, with its shares up 13.8 percent this year. It plans to sell some $15 billion in assets over time to offset the Anadarko deal. Still, investors sent Chevron shares down 4.8 percent to $120 on Friday afternoon.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth called the deal a ""great fit"" for the company. ""This is really about creating shareholder value,"" Wirth said in an interview. ""It's a great combination. That's what drives this.""
The deal is the oil industry's largest since Royal Dutch Shell bought BG Group in 2016, and it sparked speculation that other shale producers are in play. Shares of  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA), which also has extensive acreage in the Permian Basin, rose 2 percent, while  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co jumped 10 percent.
With oil prices surging this year, Chevron and larger rival Exxon Mobil have been increasing investment in the Permian Basin, the most prolific shale oil field in the country. 
Their efforts coincide with a pullback by the smaller companies that revolutionized the industry through advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking. They have had to curtail spending due to investor dissatisfaction with weak returns.
Chevron, which already has 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin, said the Anadarko deal would give the combined company a 75-mile (120-km)-wide corridor across the Permian's Delaware basin, on the Texas-New Mexico border. 
""We will now see Chevron emerging as the clear leader among all Permian players, both in terms of production growth and as a cost leader,"" said Rystad Energy head of analysis Per Magnus Nysveen, noting that Anadarko's acreage is in the ""sweetest spot"" of the Permian's Delaware Basin.
Permian producers are pumping around 4 million barrels per day (bpd) currently, and is expected to hit 5.4 million bpd by 2023, according to IHS Markit, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.
Anadarko also has a Mozambique LNG project, part of one of the industry's largest planned current investments, which Wirth said he still expects to move to final approval ""sooner rather than later"" this year. Expenses from that project are expected to reach $4 billion over several years. 
The tie-up with Anadarko adds to Chevron's deepwater investments in the Gulf of Mexico and gives it a stake in growing oil and gas production in the U.S. Rocky Mountains in Colorado.
Shares of Anadarko surged 32 percent Friday morning, reflecting the 39 percent premium offered by Chevron compared to Thursday's closing market price. The $65-per-share offer was structured as 75 percent stock and 25 percent cash. The deal includes taking on $15 billion of Anadarko's debt. 
As of Thursday's close, Chevron shares had gained 25 percent over the last two years, while Anadarko's stock had dropped 23 percent. In that time, U.S. crude oil prices have risen 20 percent. 
""This deal seems perfect. Oil is on a rebound yet Anadarko's stock price has been stagnant,"" said Chris Widell, CEO of Sponte Resources, a Dallas, Texas-based private exploration and production company. 
Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), another company with assets in the Permian, bid more than $70 per share for Anadarko and is now considering options, sources said.
MAJORS CLAIMING SHALE
Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the shale bonanza, when more nimble independent producers such as Anadarko pioneered shale drilling technology and leased Permian acreage on the cheap.
However, those majors have stepped up shale acquisitions to tap the fast returns available from these fields. Analysts have been predicting another wave of consolidation as smaller shale producers react to the majors' advance. 
Chevron said the deal would add to its free cash flow and profit one year after closing, if Brent crude, currently around $70, holds above $60 per barrel. It also said it plans to raise annual share buybacks to $5 billion from $4 billion when the deal closes, and to sell $15 billion to $20 billion of assets between 2020 and 2022.
The enterprise value of deal is $50 billion.. 
Anadarko shareholders will receive 0.3869 shares of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share.
Wirth will lead the combined company after the deal closes. Chevron will remain headquartered in San Ramon, California.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities (USA) LLC is Chevron's financial adviser, while Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is its legal adviser. 

Evercore and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are financial advisers to Anadarko, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are its legal advisers.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU tariffs to target 20 billion euros of U.S. imports - diplomats,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has drawn up a list of U.S. imports worth around 20 billion euros ($22.6 billion) that it could hit with tariffs over a transatlantic aircraft subsidy dispute, EU diplomats said on Friday.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products over what Washington sees as unfair subsidies given to European planemaker Airbus.
The EU measures would relate to the bloc's World Trade Organization complaint over subsidies to rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
WTO arbitrators have yet to set final amounts of potential countermeasures in each case.
The Commission said earlier this week that it had begun preparatory work on countermeasures in the Boeing case. However, it signaled it was open for talks with the U.S., provided these were without preconditions and aimed to achieve a fair outcome.
EU diplomats said the Commission was expected to publish a list of products on April 17 and begin a process of public consultation, after which the list could then be adjusted.
The final amount decided by the WTO arbitrator could also be lower. The EU had also initially requested that the WTO authorize countermeasures of $12 billion. 
The arbitrator's decision may not come before March 2020. In the U.S. case a WTO decision could come in June or July this year.
""You could say the Commission is preparing early, provoked by the U.S.,"" one EU diplomat said.
PLANE DISPUTE, CAR TARIFF THREAT
The dispute between the U.S. and Europe over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants to help them gain advantage in the world jet business has dragged on for year.
The case, which has been grinding its way through the WTO for almost 15 years, is approaching the final stages of arbitration after partial victories for both sides.
Trump's public attack on the EU came as his administration tries to hammer out a trade deal with China after imposing punitive tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods.
The EU is expected next week to give final clearance to the start of formal trade talks with the U.S. that could lead to the removal of duties on industrial goods and ease transatlantic tensions.
However, those talks face a series of hurdles, not least the U.S. insistence that market access for its farm products feature in the negotiations, something the EU has ruled out.
The talks follow a detente reached last July when Trump agreed not to impose duties on imports of EU cars while the two sides sought to improve economic ties.
Germany, whose exports of cars and parts to the U.S. account for more than half the EU total, wants to press ahead with talks to ward off tariffs its carmakers, including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW.

France, with few car exports to the U.S., has resisted, insisting that climate change provisions should feature in any deal - a difficult demand given Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>",JPMorgan's solid quarterly profit beats back recession fears,"By Elizabeth Dilts and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results.
The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid U.S. economic growth, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence.
U.S. bank stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent months on fears of an impending recession, with economists and investors citing concerns over a flattening yield curve and slowing housing market. But bank executives have downplayed concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth.
""There is no law that says it has to stop,"" Dimon said when asked if the decade-long economic expansion is due to turn into a recession. ""I wouldn't count on there having to be a recession in the short run.""
Loans in JPMorgan's consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $28.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We've been generally quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told reporters on a call to discuss the results. ""It doesn't diminish the fact that there are a number of risks out there. Right now we don't see that playing out in the data.""
The bank's net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters.
Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed. 
While Lake did not directly answer if the lending spread had peaked after fueling profit growth for years, she said it will likely not get any better in the coming quarters. The bank expects it to remain constant, she said. 
Unlike  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, the other big U.S. bank to report earnings on Friday, JPMorgan stood by its outlook for net interest income, a key driver of profits, which it expects to increase about 4 percent this year over 2018.
Wells said it now expects its NII to decline 2 to 5 percent instead of landing in a range of plus or minus 2 percent. The change sent Wells shares down as much 2.4 percent. Lake also reiterated the bank's 17 percent projection for return on average tangible common equity and said she does not anticipate the bank will raise it this year.
Lake downplayed questions about whether the bank's $90 million provision for credit losses in its commercial banking segment in the first quarter was a reason for concern.
""These downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names"" of diverse commercial and industrial borrowers, she said. ""We are not seeing signs of deterioration."" 
In the bank's capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year-ago quarter. Bank executives had signaled earlier in the quarter that capital markets revenue could fall by a greater amount. 
Shares of the bank were up 3.6 percent in morning trading.
The bank said net income rose to a record $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $8.71 billion, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier.
Net interest income rose 8 percent to $14.60 billion, boosted by interest rate increases since the first quarter of last year.

Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Fink was awarded $26.5 million in compensation last year, compared to $27.7 million in 2017, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink's total compensation for the year fell by 14% to $24 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo's interest income outlook spooks investors,"(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's aggressive cost cutting helped boost its quarterly profit, but shares in the lender fell 3 percent on Friday after it dialed back its forecast for how much net interest income it would bring in this year. 
The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown, which investors have feared could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.
The outlook overshadowed a jump in Wells Fargo's first-quarter profit, and comes as investors were already on edge following the abrupt departure of former Chief Executive Tim Sloan last month.
The bank has been working to keep a tight grip on costs as it continues to battle the fallout from a wide-ranging sales practices scandal that first erupted in 2016, efforts that helped its bottom line in the quarter as revenue slipped. 
Interim CEO Allen Parker said on Friday he was working on improving relations with regulators and making the bank more efficient but acknowledged ""we have more work ahead of us."" 
Analysts pushed Parker on why the bank was lowering its net interest income outlook while peers remained more optimistic, and for details on how non-interest-related revenues from fees would shape up. 
""If the revenue base keeps splitting down, I'm afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Erika Najarian said on a conference call to discuss results. 
Parker said Wells Fargo's board is pressing forward with the CEO search, but has ""complete confidence"" with current leadership. 
Finance chief John Shrewsberry reaffirmed that the lender was on track to hit its 2019 cost target. But the longer-term outlook is less certain, since the bank suspended its expense targets for 2020 after Sloan’s exit. 
Parker also did not give updated guidance for when a punitive asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve would be lifted, saying he felt it was not appropriate to do so. 
Former CEO Sloan twice pushed back when he expected to get the cap removed, which the Fed says will happen when risk management and internal controls improve.
Shrewsberry said Wells Fargo expects a decline of 2 percent to 5 percent in net interest income this year from 2018. It previously forecast between a 2 percent rise and a 2 percent fall. 
Wells Fargo's net interest income in the quarter fell 1 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the prior quarter. 
The bank blamed the decline from the previous period on a flattening yield curve, even though JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) earlier on Friday said higher rates helped boost its net interest income.
Wells Fargo shares were last down 3.2 percent.
COST CONTROLS
The bank's non-interest expenses fell 7.5 percent to $13.9 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The company is targeting expenses for 2019 of $52 billion to $53 billion. 
The decline in expenses outpaced a 1.5 percent fall in total revenue. As signs of a slowing U.S. economy mount, analysts have focused on efficiency in anticipation of slower revenue and loan growth.
The lender's efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of cost per dollar of revenue, improved from a year earlier but was higher than in the fourth quarter. 
Average loans rose slightly from the prior quarter but were still below last year. Average deposits were down 1 percent from the previous quarter and fell 3 percent from a year earlier. 
Wells Fargo's net income applicable to common stock rose https://reut.rs/2P8a214 to $5.51 billion, or $1.20 per share, from $4.73 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Analysts had expected a profit of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it is opening a defect petition review in response to a request by the Center for Auto Safety.
The agency will look at reports of the vehicles' automatic emergency braking system engaging with no apparent obstruction in the vehicle's path. There are no reports of injuries or deaths associated with the petition.
Nissan said it had investigated the issue extensively and after talks with NHTSA, as well as its Canadian counterpart, Transport Canada, it had notified all affected Rogue vehicle customers in the United States and Canada of a software update.
“As always, Nissan will continue to work collaboratively with NHTSA and Transport Canada on all matters of product safety,” Nissan said in a statement.

940,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>",Growth Stocks Haven't Been This Expensive Since the Dot-Com Peak,"(Bloomberg) -- For students of market history, the third month of the 21st century is infamous.
March 2000 was when the Nasdaq Composite Index marked a peak in the dot-com bubble. By the end of the year, it fell by more than 50 percent, with more losses to follow.
That month was one of the last times the world’s cheapest companies looked this sickly versus their pricey peers.
As of Friday, the MSCI World Value Index was flirting with a 19-year low against its growth counterpart at less than half a basis point from its dot-com nadir. That should be a gut check for equity investors in this unloved rally, bringing with it two questions: How much crowding can growth stocks sustain? And can value shares stay this cheap?
“The issue with value is that it requires a belief in the future,” Markus Rosgen at Citigroup wrote in a research note on Friday. “The world will grow and in good time value will be realized. Yet that has been missing from investor mindsets. End-is-nigh discussions still dominate.”
Fears for the economic outlook prompted a dovish pivot by the world’s major central banks in the first quarter. Easier monetary policies punish value stocks because the group includes beaten-up industries like banks, which are more sensitive to rates, while a weaker economy makes it less likely cyclical shares like industrials will catch up. The same environment makes firms that can post reliable profits throughout the business cycle even more attractive.
That’s all prompted the surging valuation gap between value and growth stocks. The monetary pivot compounded a long-term trend, of course. Cheap equities have underperformed since the eve of the global financial crisis, as investors relentlessly snubbed less reliable business models.
Rosgen at Citi is among a cohort of sell-side strategists who figure the divergence is extreme and ripe for a tentative reversal. The quantitative strategists at Societe Generale led by Andrew Lapthorne reiterated last week that they see “strong upside potential” for value shares thanks to their attractive relative valuations.
“For value to do well, economic data and earnings revisions need to be improving,” Rosgen wrote. “Here the news is encouraging.”
After a rough few months, the Citi Global Economic Surprise Index is showing signs of a turnaround. Friday’s export and credit data from China beat expectations, raising optimism over trade and the strength of the world’s second-biggest economy. On the earnings front, the number of analyst downgrades in the U.S. has eased as we head into results season. The first two big banks to report, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., both beat expectations on Friday.
For Inigo Fraser-Jenkins and his team of quants at Sanford C. Bernstein, a long-term rebound of value stocks isn’t in the cards. But they also see short-term opportunities emerging thanks to their current beaten-up state.
“Can value stocks rally when the yield curve is flat? Not in the long term, but that does not prevent tactical rallies, and we see a case for that,” Fraser-Jenkins said.
The valuation gap flirted with these levels last year, before pulling back during the fourth quarter sell-off.
Tech Boom
Meanwhile, for the doom-mongers out there, other dot-com parallels are on offer. Technology stocks are on the cusp of another record high even as bad news assails the industry, while a frenzy surrounds IPOs in the sector. Loss-making  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). raised more than $2 billion last month and shares surged in the first day of trading. They have subsequently slumped after rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. said it’s joining the party.
Even the dovish Fed tilt harks back to the late 1990s, when rate cuts helped fuel the bubble. Yet, speaking after the central bank’s March meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell brushed off concerns, arguing policy makers are much more attuned to the risks.
”Long-duration growth shares benefit from this environment, but one has to balance that against the multiple that they trade at,” Bernstein strategists wrote."
941,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Merck KGaA clinches $6.5 billion Versum takeover in bet on electrochemicals,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Merck KGaA sealed a $6.5 billion takeover deal with Versum Materials after overturning a deal it had agreed with rival bidder Entegris.
A bet on a recovery in electronic materials markets for semiconductor makers, the transaction will boost the share of profit that diversified Merck derives from high-tech chemicals to 27 percent from 19 percent previously.
Merck, also maker of pharmaceuticals and biotech production gear, this week won the backing of Versum's board for its $53-per-share offer, lifted from $48 previously, having been spurned for weeks.
""The business combination is expected to significantly strengthen Merck's Performance Materials business sector, creating a leading electronic materials player focused on the semiconductor and display industries,"" it said in a statement.
Merck's swoop comes amid depressed stock prices in the volatile semiconductor industry after demand for mobile devices slowed and prices for memory chips sank.
But Merck said https://www.merckgroup.com/content/dam/web/corporate/non-images/investors/events-and-presentations/webcasts-and-presentations/2019/us/Acquisition-of-Versum-Presentation-US.pdf on Friday it would capitalize on global data processing and storage demand mushrooming by more than 30 percent per year until 2025, fueled by trends such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.
Versum is the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products (NYSE:APD). 
Merck, whose shares were down 2.5 percent at 1400 GMT is targeting 75 million euros ($85 million) in annual synergies by the third full year after closing of the deal, which it expects in the second half of 2019, it said in a statement on Friday.
The deal will increase earnings per share in the third full year after closing, while the increase will be immediate when adjusted for one-off items, it added.
The purchase will be financed with existing cash as well as a $4 billion bridge loan and a $2.3 billion term loan provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Fortis and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Merck aims to preserve a strong investment grade credit rating, it said. 
Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are financial advisors, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is acting as legal counsel to Merck. Lazard and Citi are serving as financial advisors to Versum, with and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as legal counsel.
Entegris this week stepped back from the contest, saying it would not improve the terms of the all-share merger signed in January, which would have seen Versum investors receive about $44 worth of Entegris stock for each Versum share.

Versum had to pay Entegris a $140 million termination fee.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners and Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos Itau SA are among the groups interested in an LPG distribution unit put on the block by Brazil's Petrobras, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-controlled oil company is formally known, expects interested parties to sign confidentiality agreements, the first step to participate in the sale process of Liquigas Distribuidora SA, by April 19.
Petrobras had agreed in 2016 to sell Liquigas Distribuidora to local rival Ultrapar Participacoes SA in a 2.8 billion-real ($720 million) deal, that was blocked by Brazil's antitrust watchdog Cade in February 2018. 
Financial investors are now the main target of the new process, since a sale to one of them would avoid new antitrust hurdles.
Ultrapar is again interested in participating in the sale, Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported on Friday. But this time, Ultrapar would have to join a consortium according to new rules designed by Petrobras and its adviser,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, to avoid new antitrust problems.
Petrobras, CVC, Itausa and Ultrapar did not immediately comment on the matter.
The rules, revised earlier this week, demand from rivals with more than 10 percent of market share in the Brazilian LPG distribution market cannot have a stake in the consortium that is higher than 30 percent of Liquigas' revenue.
Liquigas is Brazil's largest LPG distribution unit, operating in the whole country with 4,800 authorized re-sellers.

953,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 08:18AM ET</span>",The Economy Is Unprepared for a Drop in Tax Refunds,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Recent headlines touting a budding rebound in U.S. car sales should not be celebrated. The much lauded 17.5-million-unit figure reported for March auto sales was actually buoyed by fleet sales, which rose to a two-year high. Retail auto sales – a pure reflection of cars sold to individuals – fell 4 percent in March and by the same amount for the first quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
Even after accounting for seasonal factors such as which period had more selling days, the data paint a bleak picture of consumer spending, which isn’t likely to get any better given the trends we are seeing this tax season. Internal Revenue Service data show tax refunds are down 4.1 percent over 2018, and the strategists at UBS AG estimate refunds will be $25 billion lower than they’d initially estimated this year.
Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in late 2017 increased take-home pay somewhat last year, millions of households nevertheless treat tax refund season as a built-in component of their annual budget. Whether it’s that summer vacation, the family room face lift, or yes, that down payment on a new set of wheels – the tax refund proceeds are the planned funding source. And consider that at the same time refunds are down, gasoline prices are up by about 50 cents a gallon from their 2019 lows, equating to a $65 billion de facto tax on households.
It’s no exaggeration to say that there are few risks to the global economy more daunting than a persistent slowdown in U.S. consumer spending. At 17 percent, U.S. consumption’s contribution to global gross domestic product eclipses that of the 16 percent attributable to the entire Chinese economy, according to  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn).
Black Knight data show that February and March mark the high points of the calendar year in which mortgage delinquencies decline due to tax refunds helping homeowners catch up on their payments. It’s probably no coincidence that mortgage delinquencies rose this February for the first time in 12 years. There's evidence that consumers looking to bolster their finances are turning to their homes increasing numbers. Tappable home equity peaked has fallen by $348 billion since peaking at $6.06 trillion in the second quarter of 2018, with $229 billion of the decline occurring in the fourth quarter as the housing slowdown deepened. Refinancing activity is up 43 percent over last year.
Some of the impetus to raise funds comes down amid a slowdown in wage growth. As noted by TS Lombard’s Steven Blitz, average hourly earnings for all workers slid to 3 percent in March on a three-month annualized basis from 3.6 percent in October.
The implications for the auto industry are twofold. April retail car sales are unlikely to rebound as tax bills hit household budgets. This one month of added strain will likely be the proverbial hair that breaks the camel’s back. According to Ward’s, auto inventories have already piled up to the extent production cuts of 4.2 percent were pushed through in February. “If demand does not make a sharp upturn, there will have to be some paring of dealer stocks through a combination of higher retail spiffs or production cuts, Ward's noted in a March 4 report.
The strain of inventories is increased further by the weakness in car sales in China, the world’s largest market since 2009. In 2018, Chinese car sales rang in at roughly 28 million units, compared with about 17 million in the U.S. As was the case with retail sales in the U.S., 2018 marked the first year of falling Chinese sales in decades. According to Xinhua, China’s state-run media outlet, car sales fell 12 percent in March from a year earlier, the 10th straight monthly decline.
Add it all up and the celebration of last week’s auto sales should be short-lived. Auto factory workers are already working 2.5 percent fewer hours than they were at this point last year, a trend that’s accelerated to an annualized pace of 14.3 percent in the last three months. When cutting hours doesn’t do the trick, layoffs kick in. According to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, auto layoffs are third only to the beleaguered retail sector and industrials this year.
The only production that looks to be increasing is that of pink slips in a sector that’s led growth in the current recovery, a development that will weigh further on U.S. spending even as consumption’s contribution to GDP has slipped to a year low. It’s likely the world economy is woefully unprepared.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 08:15AM ET</span>",Chinese group to get control of Japan Display after $2.1 billion bailout,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Chinese-Taiwanese group will take control of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Japan Display after pumping in funds as part of a 232 billion yen ($2.1 billion) bailout plan for the troubled display panel maker.
The rescue comes after previous, publicly funded bailouts failed to help the company cut its dependence on Apple, whose slowing iPhone sales have badly hit Japan Display.
The deal will make the buyers Japan Display's biggest shareholders - with a 49.8 percent stake - replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund and effectively ending the government's efforts to keep the last remaining domestic display maker out of foreign hands.
The buyer group, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group, will inject up to 80 billion yen into Japan Display by buying shares and bonds.
INCJ will also join the bailout by accepting a debt-to-preferred equity swap totaling 75 billion yen and extending senior loans worth 77 billion yen. After the deal its stake will fall to 12.7 percent from 25.3 percent.
The deal could potentially be subject to a U.S. national security review at a time when Washington is stepping up its scrutiny on Chinese investment in the United States.
Japan Display has a subsidiary in San Jose, a U.S. business that could give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) jurisdiction over the deal. 
Displays may not necessarily be critical technologies that are export controlled, but some of Japan Display's technologies such as fingerprint sensors could raise a national security concern, said Nancy Fischer and Matthew Rabinowitz, partner and senior associate, respectively, at U.S.-based law firm Pillsbury.
Minoru Kikuoka, Japan Display's finance division head, told reporters at a briefing that the company's legal advisors have said a CFIUS filing would not be necessary. CFIUS, however, retains indefinite jurisdiction to request a filing and review the transaction, even after it closes.
NEW BEGINNINGS
The bailout comes as sales of new iPhone models - many of which use newer organic light-emitting displays (OLED) - have left Japan Display's new factory that makes liquid crystal display (LCD) panels running at half capacity.
Japan Display expects to post its fifth straight year of net losses in the year ending this month, as disappointing sales of Apple's iPhone XR, the only model with an LCD screen, dashed hopes for a turnaround.
The Apple business accounted for more than half of Japan Display's revenue over the last four years.
Kikuoka said at the briefing, without naming Apple, that Japan Display still owes its client about 100 billion yen. The U.S. tech giant fronted most of the $1.5 billion construction costs for a new LCD factory three years ago.
""We discussed with our client, including that (repayment) issue as well, before we reached the agreement,"" Kikuoka said.
Under the latest deal, Japan Display and Harvest Tech, part of the buyout group, are planning to jointly produce OLED panels, used in top-end iPhones, Japan Display said.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Japan Display will begin supplying OLED screens for the Apple Watch later this year. 
Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp (T:6758) in a deal brokered by the government.

It went public in March 2014 and was worth more than 400 billion yen then. It is now worth 67 billion yen.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India imported about 5 percent more oil from Iran in the last fiscal year through March as companies raised purchases ahead of U.S. sanctions against Tehran from November, preliminary tanker arrival data obtained from shipping and industry sources showed.
Despite Washington restricting India's purchases from Tehran, refiners shipped in about 479,500 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil in 2018/19 compared with about 458,000 bpd a year before, according to the data.
The United States introduced sanctions in November but gave a six-month waiver to eight nations, including India, which allowed them to import some Iranian oil.
India was allowed by Washington to continue to buy about 300,000 bpd oil until early May.
In March India's oil imports from Iran rose to about 405,000 bpd, about 56 percent higher than February, the data showed. March volumes were however about 6 percent lower than the purchase in the same month a year earlier.
A lack of ships delayed lifting of some cargoes to end-February, leading to higher arrivals in March, sources said. BPCL could not lift a cargo from Iran as tanker was not available, a company source said.
Since November, when India received the sanctions waiver, only state-run Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals have been buying Iranian oil.
India's overall imports from Iran in 2018/19 were lower than the 500,000 bpd that Iran was hoping to sell to its second-biggest oil client after China. Indian refiners raised purchases from Iran in April-October 2018, drawn to almost free shipping and extended credit offered by Tehran to boost sales.
In the first quarter of 2019, India shipped in about 40 percent less oil from Iran at about 313,400 bpd, the data showed.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media.
Indian refiners have not yet placed orders to lift Iranian oil in May pending clarity on whether Washington will extend a the sanctions waiver.
India wants to keep buying Iranian oil at a level of 300,000 bpd, Indian sources said last month.

Refiners placed orders to buy 8 million barrels in April but India would receive higher volumes as some delayed cargoes of March arrive at Indian ports this month.

The bank said the strength of its core lending business more than offset a 10% drop in adjusted revenue from markets in the three months to March, a reflection of a strong U.S. economy where defaults are still rare.
""Even amid some global geopolitical uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to grow, employment and wages are going up, inflation is moderate, financial markets are healthy and consumer and business confidence remains strong,"" chief executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
The bank posted net earnings per share of $2.65, well ahead of the $2.36 forecast, on revenue of $29.85 billion. Analysts had expected both earnings and revenue to be broadly unchanged from last year's levels of $2.37 a share and $28.52 billion, respectively.
The bank's provisions against possible loan losses, which could have sent a warning signal about a possible cooling of the economy, fell slightly on a quarterly basis, although at $1.50 billion, they were up from $1.17 billion a year earlier.
The strength in commercial lending more than made up for a relatively weak quarter for the corporate and investment banking, where revenues from fixed-income markets fell by 8% and revenue from equity markets by 13%. The bank said it defended its position in global investment banking, however, keeping a market share of 9.6%.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars has started producing its XC40 compact crossover SUV in China to bump up capacity and cater for growing demand, the Swedish carmaker said on Friday. 
As the cost impact of Washington's trade war with Beijing spreads, Volvo has been shuffling manufacturing facilities for its models. The dispute has been squeezing capacity at Volvo's Ghent plant, the only site where the XC40 - the 2018 European Car of the Year - is currently produced. 
Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, said that from April 8 it was also being manufactured in Luqiao, south of Shanghai.
""Demand for the XC40 has exceeded our most optimistic expectations,"" Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson. ""Building (it)... in Luqiao creates extra capacity, adds flexibility to our global manufacturing network and is a clear proofpoint of our strategy to 'build where you sell'.""
The model has sold more than 100,000 units since its launch in late 2017.
The XC40 is based on a platform Volvo developed with Geely designed to share the costs of developing and manufacturing a competitive vehicle.
The platform, called Compact Modular Architecture, is shared by vehicles produced by sister brands Lynk & Co and Polestar, with Geely also planning to base a new Coupe SUV on it.
Automakers are going through one of their most uncertain periods, hit by trade wars, rising costs for developing electric cars and an industry downturn that has dented even the most profitable brands. 
The Luqiao plant, owned by Geely and operated by Volvo, currently builds the 01 SUV sold by car subscription-focused brand Lynk & Co. Polestar, Volvo and Geely's electric performance brand, said separately on Friday that starting next year it would also use Luqiao to produce Polestar 2, its first fully electric sedan that is intended to rival Tesla's mass market Model 3.

Geely has forecast flat sales in 2019 due to uncertainty about domestic demand, while Volvo has said it expects margins to remain under pressure.

VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - The latest power outage started another tough week for factory owner Antonello Lorusso in the city of Valencia, once Venezuela's industrial powerhouse.
For the past month, unprecedented nationwide blackouts paralyzed the factory and the rest of the country, cutting off power, water and cell service to millions of Venezuelans.
Lorusso's packaging plant, Distribuidora Marina, had already struggled through years of hyperinflation, vanishing client orders, and a flight of employees. Now the situation was worse.
For the whole month of March, Lorusso said, his company produced only its single daily capacity: 100 tonnes of packaged sugar and grains. When Reuters visited on April 8, he was using a generator to keep one of his dozen packaging machines working to fulfill the single order he had received. Power had been on for a few hours, but was too weak to run the machines.
""There is no information, we don't know if the blackouts will continue or not,"" said Lorusso, who has owned the factory for over 30 years. He said the plant had just a day's worth of power over the previous week.
Power has been intermittent since early March, when the first major blackout plunged Venezuela into a week of darkness. Electricity experts and the opposition have called the government incompetent at maintaining the national grid. President Nicolas Maduro has accused the opposition and the U.S. government of sabotage.
Venezuela's industry has collapsed during six years of recession that have halved the size of the economy. What is left is largely outside of the capital Caracas, the only big city that Maduro's government has excluded from a power rationing plan intended to restrict the load on the system.
In Valencia, a few multinational companies like Nestle and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co cling on. But the number of companies based there has fallen to a tenth of the 5,000 there were two decades ago, when Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez became president, according to the regional business association.
""THE GAME IS OVER""
The government said on April 4 that the power rationing plan meant Valencia would spend at most 3 hours a day without electricity, but a dozen executives and workers there said outages were still lasting over 10 hours. Generators are costly and can only power a fraction of a business's operations, they said. Many factories have shut down.
""The game is over. Companies are entering a state of despair due to their inviability,"" said an executive of a food company with factories in Valencia, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Industrial companies this year are operating below 25 percent of capacity, according to industry group Conindustria. It estimated companies lost about $220 million during the days in March without power, and would lose $100 million more in April.
Nestle's factory, which produces baby food, halted during the first blackout in early March and operations again froze two weeks later, with employees sent home until May, according to Rafael Garcia, a union leader at the plant. He blamed the most recent stoppage on very low sales of baby food which cost almost a dollar per package, or about what a person on minimum wage earns in a week.
""My greatest worry is the closure of the factory,"" said Garcia, as he sat at a bus stop on Valencia's Henry Ford avenue, in the city's industrial outskirts where warehouses sit empty and streets are covered in weeds.
Nestle did not respond to emails seeking comment.
Ford's plant along the avenue was working at a bare minimum for several months, union leaders said. In December, the carmaker began offering buyouts to staff after it received no orders for 2019, they said. Ford, in December, said it had ""no plans to leave the country.""
The outages have idled more than just factories. In the countryside, lack of power has prevented farmers from pumping water to irrigate fields.
Since January, farmers have sown 17,500 hectares of crops, a third of the area seeded last year, and they fear losing the harvest due to the lack of water, according to agricultural associations. In the central state of Cojedes, several rice growers have already lost their crops, farmers said.
""In the rural areas, the blackouts last longer,"" said Jose Luis Perez, spokesman for a rice producers federation. 
Producers of cheese, beef, cured meats and lettuce told Reuters orders had dropped by half in March as buyers worried the food would perish once their freezers lost power in the next blackout.
Back in Valencia, Lorusso was preparing his factory for the new era of scarce power. He has converted one unused truck in his parking lot into a water tank. He plans to sell another to buy a second generator.
""We've spent years getting used to things. Then we were dealt this hard blow, and now we're trying to find ways to cope,"" he said.

Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting Chief Executive Michael Manley said the group's operating performance this year would exceed the record results posted in 2018.
Chairman John Elkann said: ""Despite the (fact that the) second part of 2018 included trade difficulties in some areas that the persisted in the first part of this year, we forecast a significative improvement in the second half of 2019.""
In February weaker-than-expected guidance for 2019 profits and industrial free cash flow raised doubts about the Italian-American carmaker's longer-term targets.
Manley has sought to persuade investors that the 2020 goals - set by late boss Sergio Marchionne - were still achievable.
""I am confident that we will successfully deliver on our guidance for this year,"" he said.
The CEO said industrial free cash flow this year was expected to be more than 1.5 billion euros, down on last year due to higher capital expenditure.
At 1110 GMT Fiat Chrysler shares were up 2.6 percent.
Elkann - a scion of Italy's Agnelli family that is Fiat Chrysler's biggest shareholder - reiterated the family was prepared to take ""bold and creative decisions"" to help build a solid and attractive future for the carmaker.
He added the group was ready to play a part in the ""new and exciting"" era for the auto industry.
Recent media reports have said France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) could be eyeing a bid for Fiat while in March the president of Peugeot family holding company FFP said he would support a new deal and suggested Fiat Chrysler was among the options.
After the death of former CEO Sergio Marchionne last year, speculation about the future of Fiat Chrysler has intensified.
Marchionne, who had created the group by merging a troubled Fiat with Chrysler of the U.S., had advocated industry mergers to share the cost of building electric and self-driving cars.
Carmakers around the world are looking to tie-ups to cope with rising competition, the rise of electrification and the threat of a trade war between the United States and China.

Ghosn was arrested for the fourth time last week on suspicion that he had tried to enrich himself at Nissan's expense, to the tune of $5 million.
He is also awaiting trial on other charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust. Ghosn, who had been released on $9 million bail in early March after spending 108 days in jail, has denied all allegations against him.
Ghosn's initial detention period was set to expire on Sunday, and had been widely expected to be extended by the maximum 10 days. Public broadcaster NHK said it was rare for prosecutors' full extension request to be denied and shortened.
Ghosn's defense team has launched a public and fierce battle against Tokyo prosecutors, calling the latest arrest ""illegal"" in documents seen by Reuters. 
Later on Friday, a court rejected the defense team's appeal against the extension, meaning that the team may have to make a fresh bail application if Ghosn is indicted on further charges at the end of his new detention.

Once celebrated as a savior of a near-bankrupt Nissan 20 years ago, Ghosn has been ousted as chairman of Nissan,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp since his arrest, jeopardizing the auto-making alliance he masterminded.

Anadarko shares are indicated to open up 30% at over $61 after Chevron announced a cash-and-stock offer that values the shale-focused producer at $65 a share. Chevron stock is marked down 3%, as investors digest the message that the acquisition would take a year to be earnings-accretive for its own stock.

It will also increase its exposure to the fast-growing market for liquefied natural gas, through Anadarko’s operations in Mozambique.
Major index futures were already set to open higher, after stronger-than-expected Chinese export data for the first quarter reassured markets that Beijing’s fiscal and monetary stimulus measures have steadied the economy after its slowdown at the end of last year.

Lawmakers voted almost unanimously this week to ban military-style semi-automatic guns and assault rifles less than a month after a lone gunman used them to kill 50 worshippers in attacks on mosques in Christchurch.
""Companies involved in the manufacture of civilian automatic and semi-automatic firearms, magazines or parts prohibited under New Zealand law have been excluded from the NZ$41 billion NZ Super Fund,"" the fund said on its website.
The move was a response to the new law, it said, and identified holdings in seven companies to be affected by its decision, including American Outdoor Brands Corp, Sturm, Ruger & Co Inc and NOF Corp. 
The others are Vista Outdoor Inc, OLIN Corp, Richemont and Daicel Corp.
Others may be identified in future, added the fund, which gave no timeframe for its divestments.
Makers of tobacco and some other munitions are already excluded from its investment mandate.

Authorities have charged Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, with 50 counts of murder following the Christchurch attacks.

Bayer has seen billions wiped off its market value since August, when a first U.S. jury found Bayer liable because  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), acquired by Bayer for $63 billion last year, had not warned of the alleged risk from Roundup, which is based on active ingredient glyphosate.
It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 10,000 cases are pending.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who presided over the first two cases in federal court, said in a filing dated Thursday that Bayer and another plaintiff, Elaine Stevick, were ordered to start confidential mediation.
""The parties should propose a mediator in their case management statement; if they cannot agree, the Court will appoint someone,"" the judge ordered, cancelling a previously scheduled May 20 trial date.
Bayer said on Friday it would comply with the order in good faith, while believing strongly in the ""extensive body of reliable science supporting the safety of Roundup"".

""As this litigation is still in the early stages — with only two verdicts and no cases that have run their course through appeal — we will also remain focused on defending the safety of glyphosate-based herbicides in court,"" it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - If an overflowing inbox is killing your productivity at the office, you are not alone. 
Well, maybe you are, but not in the way you think. 
A recent survey of more than 2,000 managers and employees in 10 different countries found that employees increasingly depend on technology to communicate with their colleagues, including email (45 percent), text messaging (15 percent) and instant messaging (12 percent). 
Of those who cited email, more than 40 percent said they felt lonely always or often, were not engaged and had a high need for social connection.
Dan Schawbel, author of ""Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation,"" offered Reuters these tips on working remotely, managing technology and building a collaborative workplace.
Q. Is there a dark side of working remotely?
A. One-third of workers in the U.S. often work remotely. The number of remote workers is up 115 percent in the past decade. But just 5 percent of these workers see themselves staying at the same company for their entire career.
While we want flexibility so much, there is a tradeoff. Our research shows that remote workers are more likely to quit because of loneliness as well as low engagement. The reason why (co-working space) WeWork exists is because people want the human connection. Otherwise, people would just work from home.
Q. Is there a ""right way"" to work offsite and keep remote workers engaged?
A. These employees will work harder if they have a sense of connection. For managers, it is important to let a remote worker lead the meeting. It's so simple and brilliant at the same time. It also makes sense to fly remote workers in once a year for an offsite or social event. 
And be sure to use video conferencing often for meetings - you get to see and hear someone, which is much better than an email. It also forces you to dress like you are in the office. If you dress the part, you act the part.
Q. How can we maximize our time when we are in the office?
A. When you are working, you need time to focus, think deeply and pay attention to your words, thoughts and ideas. You also need collaborative time to share those ideas.
The actual work is important. But it's also crucial to cultivate friendships. The workplace survey I led, which was conducted by my company Future Workplace, an HR advisory firm, and Virgin Pulse, a digital health company, found that 7 percent of all employees globally have no friends at work and over half have five or fewer total friends. 
The majority of people (60 percent) said they would be more likely stay with their company longer if they had more friends. 
This was especially true for younger employees. Gen Z (74 percent) and millennials (69 percent) say they would be inclined to stay with their company longer if they had more friends than Gen X (59 percent) and baby boomers (40 percent).
You will never be able to replace face-to-face interactions at work. Once you are in a room - at a meeting, event, or even celebrating a birthday at work - be present. Put down your phone and actually talk to people.
Q. People spend so much time at work. What is the best way to avoid burnout?
A. Even if you love your job, everyone needs a break. That is why some interesting things are happening around the world to combat burnout. For example, in Finland and in the United Kingdom, they are looking at a four-day work week. In France, you actually have the right to disconnect - workers there don't have to answer email on the weekends or after work hours.
In Japan, every Japanese citizen gets the right to take Monday mornings off. 

Overall, it is about what you do, and who you do it with. The people you choose to work with are more important than the work you do. Even if you love your work, and it gives you purpose, toxic co-workers will make it unbearable.

The recount in some districts of Turkey’s largest city could take a few more days, following which the AKP will submit a so-called “extraordinary objection” to the high election board known as YSK, according to Recep Ozel, the ruling party representative on the board.
The AKP says it’s demanding a repeat of last month’s vote because “widespread irregularities” tainted the election where Erdogan’s candidate was beaten by an opposition alliance, according to an unofficial tally of the recount so far. Erdogan’s refusal to concede defeat in Istanbul and his party’s pressure for a repeat election has been condemned by political opponents as an attack on Turkey’s democratic foundations, which he’s accused of chipping away at during his decade and a half in power.
“We’ve enough documents and information in line with the election boards’ criteria that will necessitate a rerun of the election,” Ozel told Bloomberg on Friday.
The latest tally shows Ekrem Imamoglu, the opposition’s candidate to run Istanbul, leading his rival by around 14,000 votes. The ruling party’s push for fresh elections in the city is rattling investors in the Middle East’s leading economy.
The lira was trading 1.1 percent lower at 5.7975 per dollar at 12:03 p.m. in Istanbul to become the worst performing currency among emerging market peers tracked by Bloomberg.

The class-action lawsuit is the ninth against a major financial firm since a public inquiry last year uncovered widespread misconduct in Australia's financial system, including charging customers fees for no service and deception of regulators.
The suit was filed in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Sydney by law firm Quinn Emmanuel.
In a statement, the firm alleged management impropriety drew regulatory attention which hit the share price. It did not say what shareholders are asking for as compensation.
IOOF said in response it does not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct, the case is without foundation and it will mount a defense.
The wealth manager is contesting a move in December by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) to disqualify five top IOOF executives for failing to act in customers' interests.
APRA said it had identified three occasions when units of IOOF had used money belonging to pension fund customers to compensate them for losses caused by the company.
IOOF said in December that the allegations were misconceived and that it would vigorously defend against them. It added that it had already addressed or was addressing APRA's other concerns.
The regulator's move followed IOOF's appearance at the public inquiry, called a Royal Commission, and knocked 40 percent from the firm's share price.
The stock has recouped most of those losses, though one of the executives, Managing Director and CEO Christopher Kelaher, will leave the company by ""mutual agreement"" in July amid a broader overhaul.
""The reckoning that began at the Royal Commission now goes to the next stage, with the filing of this class action,"" Quinn Emmanuel partner Damian Scattini said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm Lone Star has emerged as the frontrunner to buy the German building materials business of France's Saint-Gobain in a deal valued at up to 400 million euros ($450 million), four sources familiar with the matter said.
Lone Star is using its Nordic building materials supplier Stark as an acquisition vehicle to purchase the unit, known as Raab Karcher, the sources said.
Stark was recently admitted to the second round of an auction process which kicked off in January, the sources said.
Private equity fund Platinum also made it to the final stages of the process, while U.S. rival Advent initially expressed interest but subsequently dropped out, they said.
The sources said Lone Star is ahead of Platinum as it has a more attractive business proposition due to the synergies it would extract by combining Stark and Raab Karcher.
The two funds are still carrying out due diligence ahead of a deadline for final offers in early May, the sources said, cautioning that no deal was certain.
Saint-Gobain and Lone Star declined to comment while Platinum was not immediately available.
The sale, led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), is expected to wrap up next month and could value the unit at between 300 million and 400 million euros, two of the sources said. 
Raab Karcher has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 40 million euros and is expected to fetch a multiple of no more than 10 times its EBITDA.
The unit reported revenues of almost 2 billion euros in 2017 but its margins are squeezed amid fears of a looming recession that could have a painful impact on building materials specialists.

Saint-Gobain put Raab Karcher on the block in November as part of a plan to sell non-core businesses with total revenues of 3 billion euros under a strategic overhaul overseen by new chief operating officer Benoit Bazin.

LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of a stabilisation in China's giant economy and a soggy dollar helped oil markets cement their best run for more than three years on Friday, though stocks weren't buoyed much after spending most of the week treading water.
There was a late flurry of activity, mostly from emerging markets. 
China's data showing exports rebounded nicely last month helped offset weaker imports and reports in Europe of another cut to Germany's growth forecasts, while Turkey's lira was back on the ropes amid worries about its trajectory.
The euro however gained despite the German growth concerns, and it wasn't just going rogue, with dealers gearing up for demand from Japan as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial closed in on its multi-billion euro buy of DZ Bank's aviation finance business. 
Europe's bourses slowly shook off another groggy start, as had Wall Street futures which were limbering up for earnings from bulge-bracket banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). 
""The Chinese data was a little mixed but the money supply numbers were a positive impulse overall,"" said TD Securities Senior Global Strategist James Rossiter.
It was oil though that provided the big milestones. Brent was at $71.4 a barrel, having broken back through the $70 threshold this week, and U.S. WTI was heading for a sixth straight week of gains for the first time since early 2016. 
Driving the rise has been involuntary supply cuts from Venezuela, Libya and Iran, which have supported perceptions of a tightening market already underpinned by a production reduction deal from OPEC and its allies. 
""We expect oil price to eventually move higher in Q2 as OPEC+ potentially runs the risk of over-tightening the market by maintaining its current course of action,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told the Reuters Global Oil forum.
SUBDUED SESSION 
Despite a subdued Asia session, Chinese blue chips managed to recover and close flat after Beijing's data blitz, while higher Chinese iron ore prices helped push Australia up 0.85 percent and Japan's Nikkei gained too.
In bond markets, Germany's 10-year government yields nudged back into positive territory but were capped by a report in Der Spiegel magazine that Berlin was set to halve its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0.5 percent from 1.0 percent 
That would be more pessimistic than the current 0.8 percent estimate Germany's leading economic institutes have penciled in. Worries about limp European growth also made the European Central Bank cautious at a policy meeting earlier this week.
Britain's sterling was a touch higher for both the day and the week. 
Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund managing director, said on Thursday that the six-month delay in the country's exit from the European Union avoids the ""terrible outcome"" of a no-deal Brexit, although did nothing to lift uncertainty over the final outcome.
Underscoring threats to the global economy, IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa had warned that a bigger-than-expected slowdown in China's economy remains a key risk.
Gold crept higher after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday to break below the key $1,300 level following solid U.S. data. Spot gold traded at $1,293.24 per ounce.

The California-based firm said in a statement that Chinese customers can now order a standard range Model 3 variant whose starting price of 377,000 yuan ($56,167) will make it the cheapest version of the car in China.
The model will be equipped with Tesla's Autopilot assisted driving function, the automaker said.
Tesla has been adjusting prices of its U.S.-made cars in China to remain affordable in the country, a move also aimed at fending off competition from a swathe of domestic EV startups such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.
Previously, the starting price for a Model 3 in China was 407,000 yuan for a rear-wheel-drive long range version with no Autopilot.

Tesla currently imports all the cars it sells in China. It is building a factory in Shanghai that will initially manufacture Model 3 cars.

JOHANNESBURG/NAIROBI (Reuters) - At the edge of Nairobi's Ngong Forest, thousands of used cars glitter in the hot sun on a dusty field, waiting for buyers. 
Imported from Japan or the Middle East, they offer an affordable route to vehicle ownership in Kenya and have dominated the market for decades. 
That is an obstacle big carmakers must overcome if they are to crack Africa, a market promising rapid growth as trade tensions threaten sales elsewhere. African consumers also still need conventional engines just as demand in more traditional markets is curbed by restrictions on carbon emissions.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW, Toyota, Nissan and others have joined forces to lobby governments for steps that would reduce the imports that have made sub-Saharan Africa notoriously difficult terrain and allow local production to flourish. 
""The question on Africa isn't, 'Is it a market of the future?'"" Mike Whitfield, Nissan's top executive for Africa, told Reuters. ""It's a case of when."" 
Four years after forming the Association of African Automotive Manufacturers (AAAM) their efforts are starting to bear fruit. Carmakers that set up local assembly plants could get tax holidays of up to 10 years and duty exemptions in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana, according to government plans seen by Reuters. 
Thomas Schaefer, who heads Volkswagen's Africa business, said there is a potential market in sub-Saharan Africa for 3 to 4 million new cars, up from just 420,000 in 2017. 
But that will require addressing the well-entrenched interests of second-hand car dealers, smugglers and lowering the price of new cars. 
""It will largely depend on how successful the African governments are in limiting the amounts of second-hand imports and how price-competitive new vehicles can be with their tariffs,"" said Craig Parker, Africa research director at Frost & Sullivan, a U.S.-based market research firm. 
MULTIPLYING EFFECTS
Africa's population and household incomes are rising rapidly. But its 1 billion inhabitants account for only 1 percent of the world's new passenger car sales, industry data shows. South Africans bought over 85 percent of those vehicles. 
The AAAM identified Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana as potential manufacturing hubs and helped draft legislation setting up standards and incentives.
Details of governments' plans provided to Reuters demonstrate that African nations are keen to secure a spot as a beachhead for the industry. 
Nigeria and Ghana are preparing to offer automakers tax holidays of up to 10 years and duty-free imports of parts and components used in local assembly. Nigeria also plans to double the levy on new, fully-built imported vehicles to 70 percent to boost demand for locally produced cars, though the policy's approval has been delayed. 
In Kenya, automakers will pay no import or excise duties and get a 50-percent corporate tax break. 
For African nations facing massive demographic pressures, such concessions make sense if they create jobs, said Jelani Aliyu, of Nigeria's National Automotive Design and Development Council. 
""The multiplying effects are exponential,"" said Aliyu, who foresees supporting industries developing around the plants. 
Legislative and fiscal frameworks are being finalised, but companies are already investing millions of dollars in new plants. 
VW and Nissan have set up operations in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana or have pledged to do so. Honda and Peugeot have launched assembly plants in Nigeria, and Peugeot has done the same in Kenya. 
Carmakers sorely need the business. Their South African divisions, which typically direct operations elsewhere on the continent, face stagnating domestic sales and scant growth prospects in their main export market, Europe. A chaotic Brexit or U.S. tariff hikes could further dampen sales.
Toyota South Africa's chief executive Andrew Kirby said the strategy is: ""Focus on Africa because Africa is going to grow significantly."" 
A pivot to Africa could also help insulate automakers from the immediate effects of the electric vehicle revolution. The continent is ill-placed to join it at the moment due to the higher prices of EVs and unreliable power grids. 
Just 66 electric cars were sold last year in South Africa - the continent's most developed economy.
""Africa will most likely remain as the last bastion of internal combustion engines,"" Parker said. 
DISTORTED MARKET
Nevertheless, industry officials say the biggest hurdle to developing the market for new cars is dumping from countries such as Japan, where strict vehicle inspections force cars out of circulation after just a few years. 
They say this distorts the market by allowing dealers to buy the cars at scrap prices and export them to Africa.
They blame the cheap imports for killing off assembly sectors in a number of African countries including Nigeria, which built around 150,000 cars per year until the 1980s.
Political will is needed to change that, and without it there is little point in considering a country for local production, according to VW's Schaefer. 
""The markets ... are literally not functioning right now due to importation of used vehicles,"" he said.
In Kenya, the government plans to wind down imports of cars more than three years old by 2021. Exceptions will be made for passenger vehicles with 1.5 litre or smaller engines. 
The policy could see mid-range imported models double in price, according to the 300-member Kenya Auto Bazaar Association (KABA). The lobby group has taken out ads in local newspapers denouncing the policy and is demanding a meeting with Kenya's president. 
Mark Oburu, KABA's vice-chairman, said the move would hit an industry that delivers 85 percent of Kenyan car purchases.
""The middle class will not be able to own a vehicle of their choice,"" he said. 
In the Nairobi bazaar, Grace was shopping for her eldest son's first car. She said she could not afford to buy a new one. 
""If they don't rescind that decision, we will be on boda bodas (motor-bikes).""
Both Ghana and Nigeria have also pledged to tackle the issue. Nigeria hiked taxes on imported used cars in 2014, but smuggling has undermined that effort to boost demand for local production, according to manufacturers and government officials. 
Used cars are also among the leading imports in many African countries, and governments will have to wean themselves off the associated tax revenues.
There are other stumbling blocks: access to financing is limited, and countries that don't host assembly plants must also be persuaded to limit used imports and reduce tariffs on African-made vehicles. That will be hard to do if the only outcome they see is higher sticker prices.
""The purpose is not to take the most lucrative slice of the industry,"" said Ghana's minister of trade and industry, Alan Kyerematen, suggesting that neighbours could produce components for his country's assembly plants. Auto executives acknowledge the challenges but point to a famous precedent. When VW and GM entered China in the 1980s and 90s, vehicle ownership rates were lower than in many African markets. Today, those two companies alone sell over 3.5 million vehicles annually in China. 

""Everybody was laughing, saying China doesn't need cars, they only need bicycles,"" Schaefer said.

979,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 05:09AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Toyota sees new business opportunity in leveraging hybrid tech,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Joseph White
TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - The head of Toyota Motor Corp's electric vehicle (EV) business told Reuters the automaker has received enquiries from more than 50 companies since announcing last week that it would offer free access to patents for EV motors and power control units.
The executive also said Toyota aims to use partnerships to cut by as much as half the outlays for expanded electric and hybrid vehicle components production in the United States, China and Japan.
""Until now we have been a tier 1 automaker, but now we also intend to become a tier 2 supplier of hybrid systems,"" Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi said.
Supplying rivals would greatly expand the scale of production for hardware such as power control units and electric motors that are used in gasoline-electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fully electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, he added.
Toyota last week outlined plans to offer automakers and auto suppliers royalty-free access to nearly 24,000 electrified vehicle technologies patented by the Japanese auto giant.
In an interview on Thursday at Toyota's global headquarters in Toyota City, Japan, Terashi provided new details of Toyota's strategy, and its anticipated impact on the company's investment plans.
By offering to supply rival automakers with parts used in Toyota's gasoline-sipping hybrid vehicles, the Japanese automaker sees a way to slash capital outlay by roughly half for new plants required to build electric car components for future models, Terashi said.
""We believe that this approach will reduce investment costs significantly,"" he said. 
Terashi said Toyota projects a surge in demand for electrified vehicles globally as regulators insist new vehicles emit substantially less carbon dioxide, and that working with Toyota would offer others a low-cost path to compliance.
Toyota's internal goal is to sell 5.5 million electrified, Toyota-brand vehicles annually by 2030, up from about 1.6 million vehicles now, he said.
Already, Terashi said, Toyota believes it could reach the 5.5 million target as early as 2025. The company is working on plans for a new round of capital spending to expand capacity for producing the hardware required.
(For an interactive chart on global powertrain sales forecasts, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2IdNUC7)
By offering to supply electric vehicle hardware, and the know-how to integrate it into vehicles, Terashi said Toyota wants to reduce its capital outlay, and create a new source of revenue.
""We anticipate that there will probably be very few automakers who use our patents to develop their own hybrids from scratch, so by using our system and our components, and offering our support, we can work together to develop these cars,"" Terashi said.
In the last 20 years, Toyota has managed to dominate the global market for hybrid cars by constantly improving and lowering the cost of the technology it pioneered in the Prius - and keeping this expertise a closely guarded secret. 
Toyota's new business foray underlines the challenges facing even the largest global automakers as they confront some of the most profound technological changes for automobiles in a century.
Toyota is now trying to take advantage of its lead in refining hybrid vehicles, even as it runs behind global rivals such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc in bringing fully electric vehicles to showrooms.
Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.
Roughly 15 percent of Toyota's annual global sales are hybrids, including the Corolla and the RAV4. Last year it sold 1.6 million hybrids globally, more than the 1.3 million all-battery EVs sold by Tesla Inc, Nissan Motor Co and all other automakers combined. 
To meet the expected surge in hybrid demand, Terashi said he is planning to increase production capacity for hybrid components mainly by adding capacity at existing plants.
Toyota has initially courted its partner automakers. It already supplies the plug-in hybrid system for Subaru Corp's Crosstrek SUV crossover model, and last month Toyota announced that it would be a global supplier of hybrid systems to compact car maker Suzuki Motor Co. 
The success of the Prius has helped to brand Toyota as a maker of affordable, reliable green cars and has been key to the automaker's reputation as a leader in low-emissions vehicle technology.
Terashi brushed off the risk that Toyota could lose this edge by offering its hybrid technology to other automakers, arguing that it held a crucial, 20-year head start over its rivals. 

""Even if an automaker is able to develop and produce a car using our systems and parts which complies with emissions regulations, its overall performance would never be the same as ours,"" he said.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Virgin Galactic's goal to fly tourists into space as early as this summer is about 12 years later than initially promised by its founder, British billionaire Sir Richard Branson.
But many of its customers, including Gisli Gislason, aren't sweating it.
Right up there with a few minutes in space on Gislason’s bucket list is his time on earth with other space enthusiasts and Branson, a fellow adrenaline junkie known as much for his globe-trotting stunts as for starting his own airline.
“It’s more than just a trip to space, it’s a huge, ongoing event,” said Icelandic ticket holder Gislason, who has a Virgin Galactic logo tattooed on his arm and bought his ticket to space in 2010. “I’ve already got what I paid for, so I’m just in for a bonus,” he added.
Gislason's experience is no accident.
Since its early days, Virgin Galactic specifically set out to win customer loyalty, knowing its attempt to become the world’s first commercial spaceline would likely see its share of setbacks. So featuring its top salesman Branson, the company prioritized exclusive experiences for its “future astronauts,” building a community that has stayed loyal through years of pushed deadlines and a fatal 2014 crash. 
(For an interactive version of this story, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Id1QMH)
While waiting for their trip, some since 2004, Virgin ticket holders have been busied with treats on earth: from a custom-created solar eclipse festival in Idaho and test-flight viewings in California’s Mojave Desert to spaceship-shaped cufflinks at Christmas and group excursions to Branson's private island in the Caribbean, where they can play tennis with the famous entrepreneur and swap design ideas for the spaceflight around a campfire. 
“One of our astronauts once said to me, ‘Don’t fly to space, we’re thoroughly enjoying spending all this time going to the game reserve in Africa or Necker Island,’” Branson told Reuters in an exclusive interview.
“That long, drawn out foreplay can be pretty good, the orgasm is quite quick,” he said, laughing. 
Ticket holders pay for some of these particularly high-end events, but just cover the travel for others.
“That was a compelling part of the package,” said Mark Rocket, a New Zealander who changed his name nearly 20 years ago and signed up with Virgin Galactic in 2006. “It’s not just about those few minutes in space.”
More than 600 people from 58 countries have put down a deposit for a 90-minute flight priced at $250,000, up from $200,000 in 2013. The first 100 “founders” will partake in a lottery to determine who gets to fly sooner rather than later. The company expects to increase the frequency of the flights as they build up their space fleet over time. 
It has collected about $80 million in ticket holder deposits, money which CEO George Whitesides said the company does not use for spaceship development. That funding instead comes largely from the Virgin Group and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Group. 
Other than stating Branson himself will be on the first scheduled flight, the company has not disclosed which ticketholders will go first – though Branson is considering the possibility of some customers jumping the line for the right price to help pay the bills. 
“There is a market out there we believe who would be willing to pay a million dollars to go on an earlier flight, and we’ve got a few slots at that sort of price,” Branson told Reuters.
Signed-up “future astronauts” vary from billionaires to people who remortgaged their homes to pay for the ride, from pop star Justin Bieber to Mary Wallace “Wally” Funk, 80, one of the so-called ‘Mercury 13’ women who in the 1960s passed the same punishing tests as male astronauts before the program’s funding was pulled. 
Virgin’s decision to sign up customers long before it developed and tested a commercial spaceship contrasts with Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, which will only sell tickets for its suborbital flights after it completes its crewed flight tests.
“It would not have been a Virgin company had we squirreled away in secret and built a spaceship without any customers and rolled it out once it was all ready and tested,” said Stephen Attenborough, Virgin Galactic’s commercial director and first full-time employee. 
Now, after a crewed SpaceShipTwo test flight to space in December 2018 and another carrying a test passenger in February, Virgin Galactic is inching closer to commercial flight. Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket has reached space but its first human spaceflight is still targeted for this year, and it has not determined a ticket price or when it will begin taking reservations.
Elon Musk’s SpaceX is also in the race: last year it named Japanese fashion magnate Yusaku Maezawa as its first customer on a voyage around the moon, tentatively scheduled for 2023. 
“FUTURE ASTRONAUT” STRATEGY
Virgin Galactic knew that the price tag for its flights, sold in advance to prove that there was a healthy market when there was a product to deliver, would require providing customer service during the wait.
“Right from the start it was obvious to me that if we were going to have customers and we were accepting fairly large deposits, we were going to need to communicate regularly with those people,” said Attenborough.
It was not clear how long the wait for tourist spaceflights might be, with Branson’s timelines shifting: In 2004, Virgin was saying it would offer commercial spaceflights by 2007. By 2012, the plan was 2013. 
As deadlines whizzed by, the future astronaut program evolved, organizing group trips from the Farnborough Air Show to the ‘Cradle of Humankind’ fossil site in South Africa.
“That is something that they tapped into and wised up to really early,” said Trevor Beattie, a ticketholder and UK advertising executive working on Virgin Galactic’s marketing campaign. “They created, quite deliberately, a sense of community.”
For some, access to Branson himself upped the experience.
“Isn’t it funny how the wine tastes better when you know the winemaker?” said Matthew Upchurch, a ticket holder and the CEO of Virtuoso, a travel agency network with exclusive rights to sell Virgin Galactic flights in North America.
CRASH TESTS LOYALTY       
The biggest test of this carefully built customer community came in 2014, when a test flight crash killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot.
“I remember very well waking up very early on Saturday morning after the Friday accident and wondering what would happen to this customer base,” Attenborough said.
The company reached out to customers by email on the day of the crash, both before and after the co-pilot’s death was known. There was a blog post from Branson on that day, and later, a video message. A subsequent email from the astronaut relations team said that they planned to call every customer individually.
“That was obviously a horrendous day for everybody,” said Branson, adding that his experience of a fatal 2007 Virgin Trains crash in which an elderly woman was killed meant he knew it was important to get to the scene of the test flight accident and “take these things head on.”
In the end, Attenborough said only a “handful” of customers asked for refunds.
An email seen by Reuters from the astronaut relations team three weeks after the crash said it would soon share a program of upcoming activities and trips. It advertised some “gold-dust-like spots” for a “star Galactic team” at the London Marathon – some of the sponsorship money would now go to a memorial fund for the co-pilot who was killed.
After consulting with customers, the company went ahead with one of its planned annual Virgin Galactic trips to Necker Island just a few weeks after the crash.
Now, after years of huge setbacks and surreal highs, Virgin Galactic’s ticketholders are edging closer to their flights. For some, space is still the final frontier.

“I’ve driven a Bugatti at 253 miles an hour, I’ve skied to the South Pole, swam at the North Pole. I’ve done a lot of stuff and the thing I really want to do is fly in space,” said Jim Clash, an adventure journalist and passenger 610.

983,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe's IPO Market Steps Briefly Out of Unicorns' Shadow,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- It’s hard to grab people's attention for your initial public offering when you’re competing with the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).
Still, two IPOs in Europe this week have confirmed that that market is alive and well, despite the continent’s well-publicised economic slowdown and uncertainties.
Switzerland’s Stadler Rail has even turned the 19th century business of making trains fashionable again for a while, rising over 10% from its launch price as it debuted on the Swiss SIX exchange on Friday.
Stadler’s early success comes hot on the heels of an even bigger pop earlier this week for shares in Network International (LON:NETW), a payments company spun out of the now-defunct middle eastern private equity group Abraaj.
Network International rose 17% on its first day of trading in Europe, with demand guaranteed by a $300 million commitment from anchor investor Mastercard (NYSE:MA). As of 04:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), they were still up around 18% from the IPO price as the initial volatility in the stock eased.
The deal gave an – admittedly faint - echo of last year’s spectacular debut for  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), another payments processor. Dutch-based Adyen was caught out by the broad fourth-quarter sell-off in stocks, but remains one of the big success stories of the last few years. It hit a new all-time high last week of 730.20 euros a share.
More broadly, Europe’s bourses are ending the week in positive fashion, after Chinese trade data for March suggested that the government's stimulus measures have at least halted the slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
At 04:15 AM ET, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.1% at 386.88. The U.K. FTSE led, rising 0.3% largely due to a dip in sterling, while Germany’s Dax inched up 0.1%. Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 0.2%, despite Unicredit (MI:CRDI) falling 0.5% after saying it was one of a number of banks being investigated for possible anti-competitive practices by its bond trading arm."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent at 0718 GMT, on track to end the week lower after two weeks of gains. All major markets in the region fell.
Concern about sluggish global growth were reinforced this week by central banks in the euro zone and United States, which maintained their dovish stances and separately warned of risks to the world economy.
Wall Street banks JP Morgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) report results on Friday, opening a U.S. earnings season that analysts expect will see the first year-on-year contraction in quarterly profits since 2016.
 Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and UniCredit pulled the banking sector down 0.5 percent. All other European sectors were flat or lower.
Banco Santander dropped 0.8 percent after the Spanish bank announced an offer to buy the 25 percent stake it doesn't own in its Mexican unit in an all-share deal worth around 2.6 billion euros ($2.93 billion).
UniCredit fell 1 percent after Italy's biggest bank said it is one of the banks accused of running a cartel in trading euro zone government bonds between 2007 and 2012 as financial crises dragged down banks and several European economies.
London-based online trading platform Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) plunged 37 percent as revenue for the first quarter dropped to around a fifth of last year's, hurt by a fall in trading volumes.
Its results dragged rival IG Group's shares down 7 percent, to the bottom of STOXX 600. CMC Markets shed more than 5 percent.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG dipped after China's JAC Motors said the two companies had not held talks, despite reports VW was interested in taking a stake in the Chinese electric-vehicle maker.
Germany's Software AG rose after the company released preliminary results for the first quarter and raised the outlook for its Adabas & Natural business line.

Swiss train and carriage manufacturer Stadler Rail jumped 11 percent after its debut on the SIX Swiss Exchange.

986,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 03:24AM ET</span>","Trump Realizes That Cain’s Fed Nomination Is in Trouble, Sources Say","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has said privately that he knows Herman Cain will have trouble getting confirmed to the Federal Reserve Board, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.
Some of Trump’s closest advisers want the FBI to finish its background check before he makes his decision on whether to formally nominate Cain, but others said they are aware of the misgivings of GOP senators and that they wouldn’t be surprised if Cain withdraws.
The people, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations, spoke hours after North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer said he wouldn’t back Cain if Trump nominated him to the Fed, and hopes the president will make another choice.
Cramer joined three other Senate Republicans who said they’d vote against confirmation, and Democrats remained united in their opposition. Cramer, and other lawmakers, have cited allegations of sexual harassment that derailed Cain’s 2012 presidential candidacy.
“If I had to vote today, I couldn’t vote for Herman Cain,” said Cramer, a Trump ally. “The allegations that drove him from the presidential race are just so obviously serious. I’m not talking about his position on interest rates or anything like that, but the sexual harassment stuff. Until it’s better explained I couldn’t vote for him.”
Cain’s bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination ended after he was accused of sexual harassment in the 1990s, when he led the National Restaurant Association. Cain, 73, has called the allegations unfounded.
At the White House on Thursday, Trump didn’t respond to a question about Cain at an Oval Office meeting about veterans.
On Thursday, White House economist Kevin Hassett praised Cain. “He has a lot of experience,” he told reporters. “I think he’s a smart and competent person.”
Cramer joins Republican senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado in expressing opposition to a Cain nomination, which would leave him with just 49 potential Republican votes in the 100-member chamber.
Romney didn’t mention the harassment allegations, but said that the president should choose someone less partisan and with more knowledge of economics.
No Democrats
A number of Democrats have criticized Cain’s qualifications more generally, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he didn’t know of any lawmaker in his party who would vote to confirm Cain. GOP leaders, including Republican Whip John Thune, have said they don’t expect Democratic defections.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday declined to comment about whether he would personally support the nomination of either Cain or Trump’s other pick, Stephen Moore, saying neither of Trump’s choices has been formally sent to the Senate.
“I don’t think we have a nomination,” McConnell said in an interview when asked about Cain. “I do think there are two obviously critical components of making a nomination. One is a background check and the other is the likelihood of confirmability. And as you know, some of my members have expressed concerns about that nomination.”
Trump has announced Cain and former campaign adviser Moore as his choices to fill two open Fed seats, but hasn’t taken the formal step of issuing a nomination.
Cain, who served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as well as deputy chairman and later chairman, said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on April 5 that he faced a “cumbersome” vetting process for the Fed seat, suggesting he may be considering withdrawing. Trump this week said it would be up to Cain whether he wanted to follow through with a nomination.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who came to power after a stunning election victory in May, has vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls ""unfair"" Chinese projects authorized by his predecessor, Najib Razak.
The two sides have agreed to cut the cost of the 688-km (430-mile) rail project to 44 billion ringgit ($10.7 billion) from the original 65.5 billion ($16 billion), Mahathir's office said in a statement.
""This reduction will surely benefit Malaysia and lighten the burden on the country's financial position,"" it said, adding that more details would be revealed on Monday.
In January, Reuters reported, citing sources, that contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) had offered to nearly halve the cost to save the project, known as the East Coast Rail Line (ECRL).
In March, Malaysia's representative in the talks, Daim Zainuddin, said they could include commercial elements that would benefit the southeast Asian nation, but he did not elaborate.
Launched in 2017, the project to link Malaysia's east coast on the South China Sea with the busy waterway of the Malacca Strait on the west, has seen costs balloon amid a lack of transparency, threatening to saddle the country with uncomfortably large debt.

Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said that while he’s written in the past about the advantages of taxation on consumption, he’ll leave any decision on value-added tax to the “politicians” in the government, Il Messaggero reported Friday, citing an interview.
Disagreement within the Cabinet, with Tria warning that budget measures can’t be financed without raising VAT, have led to the adoption of a less ambitious version of earlier proposals for a full flat tax, newspapers including La Stampa reported Wednesday.
Responding to a question from Il Messaggero about the country’s stagnant growth, Tria pointed to measures recently enacted by the government, saying their effects will likely not be noticeable until the second half of the year.
Tria, like Deputy Premiers Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, ruled out so-called “corrective measures” for the 2019 budget.
“There will not be any corrective measures in the traditional sense of the term,” the finance minister said. There could be “quantitative measures, but without modifying the structure of the budget.” Tria also said an improvement in the structural deficit may be possible, even if it’s only a tenth of a percentage point.
Italy needs lower income taxes, Tria said, saying that the country’s growth will be fueled by reforms to the tender process designed to unblock building projects. He pointed to 87 billion euros ($98 billion) currently blocked in public accounts due to bureaucratic hurdles."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Airlines shareholders have demanded to see 2018 accounts before considering providing at least HK$2 billion ($255 million) needed to ensure the carrier - part owned by the indebted HNA Group - keeps its license, two sources said.
The demand came at a tense extraordinary shareholder meeting last week and at which former majority owner HNA did not speak at all, the sources said of the discussion, which has not previously been reported. 
Shareholders questioned the airlines' dealings with other HNA firms, including querying the prices paid to lease planes from affiliates as well as the cost of materials bought from them, the sources said, declining to be identified as the information was not public.
Hong Kong Airlines said, as a private company, it does not comment on its financial activities. HNA declined to comment.
Just weeks earlier, Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) demanded the airline detail plans to improve finances. ATLA declined to comment further on Friday.
ALTA's demand came after a travel insurer in January dropped protection against the airline's collapse, prompting the airline to reassure customers it was operating as normal. A month before, the airline suffered a series of executive departures.
Meanwhile, the formerly acquisitive HNA - a planes-to-banking Chinese conglomerate - has been working to improve finances since China cracked down on aggressive debt-fueled foreign dealmaking began in mid-2017.
At that point, a $50 billion spree had netted HNA assets including the single largest stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). It has since been selling off holdings, including low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express Airways last month.
At last week's meeting, Hong Kong Airlines executives told shareholders that without fresh funds, the airline's operating license was at risk, said the people familiar with the matter.
Executives then discussed raising HK$2 billion via share placements, the people said. Such a move would significantly dilute the holdings of shareholders if they do not participate.
Major shareholders include Chinese private equity firm Frontier Investment Partner with about 34 percent, and Zhong Gousong, a former executive and director of the airline, at about 27 percent.
HNA cut its stake in the carrier two years ago and currently owns 29 percent through Hainan Airlines, its mainland flagship airline and China's fourth-largest carrier.
Meeting attendees demanded to see the airline's accounts for 2018 including details of interactions with other HNA firms before considering whether they would participate in the share placements, the people said.
The airline also told shareholders that it swung to a loss of about HK$3 billion last year, the people said. In 2017, it booked profit of HK$759 million, showed accounts for that year seen by Reuters.
The 2017 accounts showed signs of rising financial strain, including a 50 percent jump in trade receivables - money due but not received - while revenue rose only 11 percent. Payments owed to the airline by HNA companies more than doubled to HK$1.3 billion, or 73 percent of total receivables. 

The airline also held stock of four unlisted HNA affiliates, worth $367 million at the end of 2017, and had outstanding loans at that point of $300 million extended to two other HNA firms.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Foreign insurers including Generali (MI:GASI) and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc are in early talks with authorities to enter China's private pensions sector, people with knowledge of the matter said, as Beijing opens up to overseas companies.
Hong Kong-based AIA Group and Manulife Financial are also considering similar moves, they said.
Beijing gave approval to the first foreign joint-venture firm to establish a pensions insurance business last month and two of the people said China has been running pilot projects in three provinces involving foreign firms. Those projects end later this year.
Foreign insurers would compete with eight established Chinese pension insurance firms that dominate the potentially lucrative market, where the fast-greying population is set to produce 250 million people older than 60 by 2020.
""The average longevity of people in China is increasing but the pension market remains under-penetrated,"" Prudential Asia Chief Executive Nic Nicandrou told Reuters.
Some of the foreign companies are expected to submit applications in the second half of this year to set up pensions businesses, the people said. They declined to be identified as the plans are not firm yet and also are not public.
""POISED""
Last month, Heng An  Standard Life  (LON:SLA), a joint venture between Standard Life Aberdeen and Tianjin TEDA International, became the first foreign joint-venture entity to receive regulatory approval by China to establish a pensions insurance company.
China's pensions assets, including those managed by the state, grew by 20 percent in 2017 to 11 trillion yuan ($1.64 trillion) and are expected to more than quadruple by 2025, consultancy KPMG said in a report this year.
Underlining the potential, consultant Willis Towers Watson said China has one of the lowest ratios of private-employee annuity pension assets to GDP among major economies at 1.5 percent. That compares with 120.5 percent of GDP in the United States and more than 130 percent in Australia.
Prudential has a 50-50 life-insurance venture with China's CITIC Group. Nicandrou said the venture is ""well poised"" to participate in the pension market but he did not elaborate on any specific plans.
Rob Leonardi, Asia regional officer for Italy's top insurer Generali, said the firm was seeing progress in pensions reform in China.
""If this trend continues, we can expect more foreign funded companies to express further interest in the coming months,"" he said. The company declined to give details about its plans for the market.
AIA, which operates the only wholly owned foreign life insurance business in China, declined to comment.
""MATTER OF TIME""
Global asset managers have been lobbying Beijing to offer tax benefits and other incentives to encourage investment in mutual funds for retirement.
Manulife, which signed a pact with Agricultural Bank of China in 2017 to jointly explore opportunities in China's pension and retirement market, is looking to establish a joint-venture pension management company.
It plans to draw upon its life insurance and asset management joint ventures in China to launch retirement solutions and products, said Calvin Chiu, head of Asia retirement at Manulife Asset Management.
""The government has expressed willingness to open up the financial services sectors in the country, it's just a matter of time and priority. They do recognize the value that foreign players can add in the pension space,"" he said.
China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
""All countries are trying to shift pensions away from the iron rice bowl concept,"" Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Heng An Standard Life said.

""There have been some attempts at this in China, but, the fact is, there is technology in the west, and an approach to this which the Chinese were keen to bring into their market.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Budget Indian airline SpiceJet Ltd said on Friday it planned to lease a ""first lot"" of 16 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-800s to help fill a gap in aviation capacity that ratings agency ICRA said has pushed up fares by 30 to 40 percent since September.
SpiceJet had canceled some flights due to the grounding of its 12 737 MAX planes after Ethiopian Airlines' deadly March 10 crash. However, the bulk of the reduction, which ICRA said removed 15 percent of market capacity, is due to Jet Airways Ltd grounding more than three-quarters of its fleet as a result of funding problems.
""The sudden reduction of aviation capacity has created a challenging environment in the sector,"" SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said in a statement. ""SpiceJet is committed to working closely with the government authorities to augment capacity and minimize passenger inconvenience.""
India's civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu has directed the civil aviation secretary to review issues related to Jet Airways and take steps to minimize the inconvenience to passengers and ensure their safety, the minister said in a Tweet on Friday.
India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation has de-registered 11 737-800s that had been leased by Jet Airways on request from lessors, the agency's website said, and another 14 requests for de-registration remain pending.

SpiceJet did not say whether it planned to lease planes that had previously been flown by Jet. The budget carrier's shares rose 5 percent in early trade on Friday.

Takahiro Hachigo made the comments to a small group of reporters after the official opening of a new plant in Wuhan. 
Hachigo said that the catch-up could happen ""soon"", later clarifying to Reuters that he was referring to a two-to-three-year time period. 
""We would like China sales to overtake the U.S.,"" he said, adding that the company did not expect U.S. sales to increase significantly. 
Honda's manufacturing capacity in China could be expanded if necessary, he added. 

Honda last year sold roughly 1.7 million vehicles in the United States and 1.4 million in China.

Tesla said its customers in the United States would be able to lease any Model 3 variant for a small down payment and monthly payments thereafter, but they will not have the option to buy the car at the end of the lease.
Tesla said that it would begin bundling its autopilot software as a standard feature on all cars, raising the base price, and would drop the entry-level Model 3 Standard from online ordering.
As a result, the lowest-priced Model 3 available for order on its online menu in the United States is now the $39,500 Standard Plus, which includes Autopilot.
The company in February had rolled out its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car with great fanfare.
The company also said the Standard variant of Model 3 will now be a software-limited version of the Standard Plus, to simplify production.
As part of the changes to its online ordering, Tesla said the Model 3 Standard variant and the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive will be taken off the online ordering menu but will still be available for order by phone or in stores.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 11:50PM ET</span>",Uber unveils IPO with warning it may never make a profit,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technologies Inc has 91 million users, but growth is slowing and it may never make a profit, the ride-hailing company said on Thursday in its IPO filing.
The document gave the first comprehensive financial picture of the decade-old company which was started after its founders struggled to get a cab on a snowy night and has changed the way much of the world travels. 
The S-1 filing underscores Uber's rapid growth in the last three years but also how a string of public scandals and increased competition from rivals have weighed on its plans to attract and retain riders. 
The disclosure also highlighted how far Uber remains from turning a profit, with the company cautioning it expects operating expenses to ""increase significantly in the foreseeable future"" and it ""may not achieve profitability."" 
Uber lost $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations.
The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed Uber had 91 million average monthly active users on its platforms, including for ride-hailing and Uber Eats, at the end of 2018. This is up 33.8 percent from 2017, but growth slowed from 51 percent a year earlier.
Uber had not disclosed the latest user numbers before, and the figure indicates the scale of the business. Although its user base includes customers of other services and ride-sharing, the number is nearly five times the 18.6 million announced by rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). 
Uber in 2018 had $11.3 billion revenue, up around 42 percent over 2017, but below the 106 percent growth the prior year. 
Uber set a placeholder amount of $1 billion but did not specify the size of the IPO. Reuters reported this week that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. 
Investment bankers had previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion. 
Uber would be the largest initial public offering since that of Chinese e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014, which raised $25 billion. 
Although Uber is no longer targeting a $120 billion valuation in the IPO, some stock bonuses to Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and other company executives are only triggered when that valuation is reached. 
Uber will follow Lyft in going public. 
Shares in its smaller rival closed at $61.01 on Thursday, 15 percent below its IPO price set late last month, a development which has sent a chilling signal for other tech start-ups looking to go public. 
After making the public filing, Uber will begin a series of investor presentations, called a roadshow, which Reuters has reported will start the week of April 29. 
The company is on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Uber faces questions over how it will navigate any transition toward self-driving vehicles, a technology seen as potentially dramatically lowering costs but which could also disrupt its business model.
Last year, the ride-hailing giant settled a legal dispute over trade secrets with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit.
Waymo, in its lawsuit, had said one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber's self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents.
Uber revealed in the filing it could have to pay a license fee to Waymo or face a substantial delay to the development of its self-driving technology if the initial assessment of its technology by an independent expert is confirmed.
The expert, installed as part of Uber's settlement with Waymo, has identified on an interim basis certain functions in Uber's autonomous vehicle software that ""are problematic and other functions that are not,"" Uber said.
A Waymo spokesperson said: ""This review is on-going and we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber.""
One advantage Uber will likely seek to play up to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it operates. Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber's business model to become profitable. 
In addition to answering questions about Uber's finances, CEO Khosrowshahi will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.
Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO. 
Uber said in its filing its ridehailing position in the United States and Canada was ""significantly impacted by adverse publicity events"" and that its position in many markets has been threatened by discounts from other ride-hailing companies.
A #DeleteUber campaign surged on social media in 2017 after a public relations crisis, which Uber said in its filing meant hundreds of thousands of consumers stopped using its platform within days. 
Uber said its market share fell in most regions last year, although the rate of decline has slowed. The company claims more than 65 percent market share in the United States and Canada, versus Lyft's stated 39 percent in the United States. 

Uber is reserving some shares in the IPO for drivers who have completed 2,500 trips among other criteria.

998,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 11:21PM ET</span>",Toshiba shares slump after sale of U.S. LNG business canceled,"By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp shares fell more than 5 percent on Friday after an agreement to offload its U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) business collapsed, a blow for the Japanese conglomerate which has been shedding assets to turn around its business.
Toshiba said late on Thursday that China's ENN Ecological Holdings Co had scrapped an agreement to take over the LNG business due to a failure to get approvals from shareholders and a U.S. panel that monitors foreign investments.
Toshiba shares fell as much as 5.4 percent to 3,485 yen and ended morning trade at 3,555 yen. The broader market was up by about 0.6 percent.
Toshiba must now look for a new buyer for the business that it previously said may cause losses of as much as 1 trillion yen ($9 billion).
Spot LNG prices are trading at about half the level they were when Toshiba agreed to pay ENN more than $800 million to take over its U.S. operations.
A failure to find a buyer could derail Toshiba's recovery from the fallout of the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse, analysts have said.
""The challenge in obtaining U.S. approvals provided an opportunity for ENN to walk away from a deal that will be out of the money in the near term following a collapse in LNG spot prices,"" said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research for Australia at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
""At current LNG spot prices, it will be a challenge to bring U.S. LNG volumes into Asia on a cash cost basis, let alone factoring in an additional processing tariff,"" he said.
Toshiba stunned the market in 2013, when it decided to enter the LNG business. With no experience in shipping or the logistics of the gas and LNG business it seemed an odd fit, analysts said at the time.
Toshiba's plan was to pitch LNG supplies as a sweetener to potential Asian buyers of its turbines used in combined cycle gas-fired power plants.
The company signed up to take 2.2 million tonnes of LNG annually from the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas, construction of which is almost complete. 
The arrangement requires Toshiba to pay a processing fee for the LNG, regardless of whether it takes the fuel.
The company has been trying to sell the business since at least 2015.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 08:06PM ET</span>",Walmart responds to Bezos with tweet asking Amazon to pay taxes,"By Nandita Bose and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Thursday challenged retailers to hike their minimum wages to $16 an hour, prompting a comeback from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc which asked its rivals to pay taxes.
""Today I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said in a letter to shareholders.
""Do it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us.""
The online retailer raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees from November, giving in to critics of poor pay and working conditions at the company.
Some critics have said the hike was insufficient and note that Amazon paid zero U.S. federal income tax on more than $11 billion in profits before taxes in 2018, and received a $129 million tax rebate from the federal government.
Walmart's executive vice president of corporate affairs, Dan Bartlett, responded to Bezos by tweeting, ""Hey retail competitors out there (you know who you are) how about paying your taxes?""
Walmart, which has raised its minimum wage twice since 2015, pays an entry wage of $11 per hour. CEO Doug McMillon has said Walmart's average U.S. hourly wage is $17.50 including bonuses based on store performance, and excluding healthcare benefits.
The two retailers, which are fierce rivals, rarely go after one another other publicly.
Amazon's wage hike came as U.S. unemployment was at a near two-decade low, with retailers and shippers competing for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season.
Bezos said in his letter that the wage hike has benefited more than 250,000 Amazon employees and over 100,000 seasonal employees who worked during the last holiday season at Amazon sites in the United States. 
Amazon's third party sales in 2018 accounted for 58 percent of total sales, up from 56 percent in 2017, Bezos said.
Amazon has said that it pays all the required taxes in every country where it operates, including $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years.

""Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,"" according to recent Amazon statements.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 06:36PM ET</span>",Boeing CEO says 737 MAX software update working as designed,"By Eric M. Johnson
DALLAS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's chief executive said on Thursday that a software update designed to prevent disasters like two recent fatal crashes involving its 737 MAX is working, with about two-thirds of the fast-selling jetliner's customers having seen the fix in simulator sessions.
In his first public speech since an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash that killed all 157 aboard on March 10, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said additional tests are expected in the coming weeks as the planemaker works to regain the confidence of its customers and the flying public.
Boeing, fighting its biggest crisis in years, has been developing an upgrade to software that is under scrutiny in the Ethiopian Airlines accident and a Lion Air 737 MAX crash that killed all 189 on board on Oct. 29.
The world's largest planemaker is under pressure to convince MAX operators and global regulators that the aircraft, which was grounded worldwide in March, is safe to fly again.
Muilenburg said he recently joined one of 96 test flights during which Boeing crew performed different scenarios that exercised the software changes in multiple flight conditions over 159 hours of air time.
""The software update functioned as designed,"" he said, without indicating when Boeing will deliver the fix to international regulators for their review, which is expected to last around 90 days.
Boeing is working to address a glitch when separate software is integrated into the system that was uncovered during an internal review, raising questions on how long before it submits the upgrade for certification.
Initial accident investigation reports show a 737 anti-stall system triggered by bad data from a key airflow sensor was ""one link in a longer chain of events"" in the two crashes, Muilenburg said at a leadership forum in Dallas.
""We know we can break this chain link. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk."" 
Last week Boeing cut its monthly 737 production by nearly 20 percent, signaling it did not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon.
Chicago-based Boeing has not received any new orders for the 737 MAX since the crash in March, nor it could make deliveries of the grounded aircraft.
The 737 MAX has been considered the likely narrowbody workhorse for global airlines for decades to come. There were more than 300 MAX jetliners in operation at the time of the Lion Air crash and about 4,600 more on order.

Muilenburg joined Boeing in 1985, became CEO in July 2015 and chairman of the board in March 2016.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 05:53PM ET</span>",Trump foe Michael Avenatti indicted for financial crimes,"By Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - Michael Avenatti, the combative lawyer known for his battles with U.S. President Donald Trump, was indicted on charges of defrauding clients, including allegations that he withheld a multimillion-dollar settlement he won for a paraplegic man, prosecutors said on Thursday.
The indictment came about three weeks after Avenatti, who gained national fame for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her litigation against Trump, was arrested in New York on separate criminal complaints filed by federal prosecutors in New York and California.
Federal prosecutors in California announced the indictment after a grand jury found late on Wednesday that there was probable cause to pursue charges against Avenatti. The 48-year-old lawyer, a Los Angeles resident, said he planned to fight the charges and plead not guilty.
""I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me,"" Avenatti, who is free on a $300,000 bond, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. 
The federal complaint in California charges Avenatti with 10 counts of wire fraud, accusing him of misusing more than $12 million he received on behalf of clients following settlements and other negotiations. 
""Money generated from one set of crimes was used to further other crimes, typically in the form of payments designed to string along victims so as to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing,"" Nicola Hanna, the U.S. attorney for California's Central District, said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
Avenatti became a prominent critic of Trump and a frequent guest on cable television news while representing Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She sued the president over a nondisclosure agreement that in the weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election kept her from discussing her claims that she and Trump had an extramarital affair 10 years earlier. 
Prosecutors say Avenatti misled clients and misused their funds to pay personal and legal expenses, finance a coffee shop business he also ran, and pay for his share of a Honda private jet, according to the indictment. Federal authorities seized the jet on Wednesday, prosecutors said. 
In one case, prosecutors said that Avenatti concealed a $4 million settlement won by a client in 2015 from Los Angeles County after he became paraplegic in an unspecified incident, instead giving the man periodic advances of $1,900 and paying the rent at his assisted living facility.
The client, referred to only as ""Client 1"" in the indictment, was identified as Geoffrey Johnson by his lawyer, Joshua Robbins. 
On Thursday, Avenatti said on Twitter that the accusation that he had mishandled clients' money was ""bogus nonsense"" and posted an undated testimonial signed by Johnson that praised him as an ""exceptional, honest and ethical attorney."" 
Johnson no longer stood by that statement, his lawyer said.
""It was signed before he was aware of the fraud,"" Robbins said in an interview, adding that Avenatti lied to Johnson in order to get him to sign the testimonial in March, shortly before Avenatti's arrest. 
Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately return calls for comment on the statement.
According to the indictment, Johnson's efforts to buy a house failed because Avenatti withheld the settlement money, and Avenatti lied to the U.S. Social Security Administration about the settlement to conceal the embezzlement, leading the agency to cut off Johnson's benefits. 
TAX CRIMES
The indictment also accuses Avenatti of various tax crimes. He is accused of failing to file personal tax returns since 2010 and to pay $3.2 million in payroll taxes on his coffee business, even though he withheld some portion of this money from employee paychecks.
The indictment said he defrauded a Mississippi bank of $4.1 million in loans by submitting false tax returns for 2011 to 2013 that inflated his income.
The most serious bank fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years per count, prosecutors said. Federal sentencing guidelines typically call for defendants to serve less than the maximum time.
The New York prosecutors have separately accused Avenatti of trying to blackmail athletic wear maker  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) for more than $20 million.

Daniels, who replaced Avenatti as her lawyer last month, has said she was ""saddened but not shocked"" by his arrest.

1004,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo) Kick off Earnings for Banks
The first-quarter earnings season has started already with Delta Air Lines' (NYSE:DAL) report today, but things get a lot of heavier on Friday when three big banks report results before the bell.
Banks have been dealing with lower interest rates, which are squeezing profit margins, and their stocks have trailed the market rebound that set in after the Christmas 2018 slump.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the biggest U.S. bank by assets. Analysts polled by Investing.com see the bank earning $2.36 a share in the quarter, down a penny from $2.37 a share in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue is forecast at $28.5 billion, essentially flat from a year ago. The shares are up about 8.8% this year, but that gain comes after the 13.5% decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an 8.7% decline for the year.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) will report $1.12 a share for the period, according to analysts, unchanged from a year ago. Revenue is likely to come in at $20.97 billion, down 4.3% from a year ago.
The stock is up just 3.6% this year after falling 12.3% in the fourth quarter and 14.2% for all of 2018.
Wells Fargo is still struggling to get its management problems under control. Tim Sloan resigned as CEO on March 28, pummeled by regulators, Congress and even his own board. The bank is searching for a new CEO.
And PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) is expected to earn $2.61 a share in the first quarter, up from $2.43 a share a year ago. Revenue is projected at $4.27 billion, up 3.9% from $4.11 billion in the year-ago period. The shares are up 9.8% this year after falling 14.2% in the fourth quarter and 18.9% for all of 2018.
In all, this earnings season is expected to be a disappointment. FactSet expects earnings for companies in the S&P 500 to decline 4.2%, which would be the first year-over-year decline since the second quarter of 2016.
2. Michigan Sentiment Seen Dipping
The health of the U.S. consumer dominates the economic calendar tomorrow.
The University of Michigan will release its preliminary measure of April consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The Michigan consumer sentiment index is expected to edge down to 98.1, following two-straight months that saw gains above expectations, according to economist forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The consumer expectations component is also expected to drop slightly, falling to 88.5.
3. Will Rig Count Ramp up Again?
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes comes tomorrow after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by 15 to 831.
That was the first increase in seven weeks adding to fears that U.S. energy producers are set to ramp up production, which remained at a record 12.2 million barrels a day, the EIA said on Wednesday.
Drilling activity had been on the wane in recent weeks as energy firms ditched big exploration and production spending to focus on earnings growth rather than increased output.
A second-consecutive gain in rig counts will likely add credence to the EIA's expectations that U.S. energy companies will continue to raise output this year.
U.S. crude oil production is expected to rise by 1.43 bpd in 2019 to average 12.39 million bpd, the EIA said on Tuesday, up from its previous forecast for a rise of 1.35 million bpd.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 1.6% lower at $63.58 a barrel."

Avianca Brasil filed for bankruptcy protection in December and has since incurred increasing debts with lessors and airport operators as it continued to carry out most of its scheduled flights. The airline is very low on cash and fell behind on its payroll in March.

1008,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Stocks - Market Closes Little Changed as Traders Cautiously Await Earnings,"Investing.com - Wall Street finished about flat Thursday, with investors skittish ahead of earnings reports from major Wall Street banks due Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.05%, the S&P 500 was flat, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21%.
A rise in financial stocks ahead of the earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) battled with investor fears that the first-quarter earnings season may turn out to be the most challenging in recent quarters.
First-quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4.2% year over year for S&P 500 companies, according to FactSet, compared to a 3.9% decline forecasted just one week ago. That would mark the largest year-over-year decline in earnings since the first quarter of 2016.
The primary focus for investors will be on companies' guidance as it ""will let us know what to expect, whether (potentially negative earnings) is a one-quarter blip or if we're moving into an earnings recession,"" said Jim Powers of Delegate Advisors.
Tech stocks were among the weakest in today's trading, led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after Credit Suisse said it expected iPhone sales, which make up about 60% of the tech giant's total sales, to decline double digits in 2019.
""(The) iPhone is in a difficult spot with units (more than) 20% below peak as users are holding onto their devices longer than ever and price hikes have likely run their course” said Matt Cabral, Credit Suisse’s director of equity research.
Among other FAANG stocks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) ended the day 1% higher, even as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) is set to unveil more details about its rival streaming service Disney+ at an investor day event at 5 PM ET (21:00 GMT).
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were little changed on the day as a decline in U.S. oil prices kept a lid on gains.
On the trade front, meanwhile, investors digested news pointing to further progress on a China-U.S. deal with The Wall Street Journal reporting that China agreed to open its cloud-computing sector to foreign companies.
This comes a day after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said an enforcement mechanism, one of the main sticking points in the talks, was nearly finalized.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2.8% after Nikkei Asian Review reported that the electric automaker and Panasonic were halting plans to expand capacity at its Gigafactory 1 near Reno, Nev.
Tesla disputed the report saying ""contrary to what is implied in this report, our demand for cells continues to outpace supply. It remains the fundamental constraint on Tesla vehicle and Powerwall/Powerpack production.""
On the economic front, stronger-than-expected U.S. wholesale inflation and another drop in jobless claims eased fears of slowing growth.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 04:37PM ET</span>",The S&P 500 ends flat as investors await bank earnings,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended little changed on Thursday as growing anxiety over a global economic slowdown offset upbeat data and investors waited for earnings season to kick into high gear.
In choppy trading, the Nasdaq and the Dow closed lower, with healthcare stocks weighing on all three major U.S. stock indexes.
""You have these tug-of-war days where nothing much happens,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""It's reflecting people waiting more information, like corporate earnings."" 
On the economic front, initial jobless claims dropped last week to their lowest level since 1969, while in March, producer prices made their biggest gain since October, according to separate reports from the U.S. Labor Department.
The upbeat data could ease worries of a sharp global economic downturn reaching U.S. shores, a concern reflected in minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting released on Wednesday.
As reporting season begins, analysts expect S&P 500 first-quarter profits to have dropped 2.5% year-on-year, their first contraction since 2016.
But Carlson wonders if those estimates are overly pessimistic. ""Does (the market) think earnings are going to be better than analysts think? We'll get a first taste of that from the banks tomorrow."" 
Financial stocks were up 0.6% ahead of a string of earnings reports from six major U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co are due to report on Friday, followed by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Inc on Monday and Bank of America Corp and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Tuesday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.11 points, or 0.05%, to 26,143.05, the S&P 500 closed flat at 2,888.32 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.89 points, or 0.21%, to 7,947.36.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven closed in the black.
Healthcare stocks were by far the biggest drag, falling 1.2% a day after U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a ""Medicare for All"" plan to Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee concluded a hearing to discuss the role pharmacy benefit managers play in drug pricing.
""I'm a bit surprised we're seeing that kind of reaction to these proposals that for the time being aren't going anywhere,"" Carlson added. ""Maybe it's foreshadowing a change.""
UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) weighed heaviest on the Dow, falling 4.3%. 
U.S. Steel Corp dropped 3.2% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) cut its rating on the stock to ""underperform."" Peers AK Steel Holding Corp and Steel Dynamics Inc dropped 8.3% and 2.5%, respectively.
Home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) fell 8.8% as its bleak first-quarter profits raised doubts about its turnaround plan.
Shares of  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) reversed course, rising 1.5%. Still, the stock is currently trading about 15% below its $72 offer price since its March 29 debut, casting a shadow over rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technologies' impending IPO.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 30 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.00 billion shares, compared to the 7.17 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Former Bolthouse Chief Executive Officer Jeff Dunn, who was leading the group of investors, is working with private-equity firm Butterfly Equity and has entered into exclusive talks with the U.S. food company for Campbell's fresh food unit, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Journal in a previous version of the report said that Campbell was nearing a deal to sell its fresh food unit, including Bolthouse Farms.
Campbell had bought the Bolthouse unit for $1.55 billion in 2012.
The two sides could announce a deal as early as Friday, but a deal is not guaranteed as the board has not signed off on it, the report added.
A Campbell spokesman declined to comment.
The company's international unit, along with its fresh food business, has been up for sale since August after Campbell was pressured by investors to boost its profitability and stock performance.
Earlier this year, Campbell said it expects to name buyers for Bolthouse Farms and its international business by the end of fiscal 2019. The company also said it would sell salsa maker Garden Fresh Gourmet to a unit of Fountain of Health USA, which makes hummus, dips and prepared salads.

Investing.com - Iconic chocolate maker Hershey's shares have been pretty sweet of late, reaching new highs recently. But is the stock now priced for perfection?
Certainly Goldman Sachs thinks so, saying on March 29 that the shares were vulnerable to a 20% pullback.
Hershey (NYSE:HSY) shares duly rose nearly $3 to a 52-week high of $116.73 on Tuesday before drifting back. They're off 0.5% today and 0.8% from that Tuesday peak. But they're still up 30% from early May.
But don't just listen to Goldman. There are good reasons to think the stock has all the good news priced in.
The consensus target price from analysts polled by Investing.com is $103.67, down more than 10% from current levels. Of 16 analysts who cover the stock, only three rate it a buy. Twelve are neutral.
The company is struggling with sales growth. North American sales overall grew 4.3% in the fourth quarter, but most of that was due to sales from new acquisitions. Back that out and core Hershey sales fell around 3%. About 89% of Hershey's $7.8 billion in sales in 2018 came from North America.
Competition is getting tougher, especially from arch rival M&M Mars.
Distribution costs are rising, thanks in part to higher fuel prices.
But Hershey was a great counter-play in the fourth quarter when the stock market was tanking, rising 5.1% when the major averages tumbled 20% or more. And Hershey is up 8% this year.
If Hershey does fall, it will not be because sales are growing slowly. It's a product where sales rise with population and are basically stable. The controlling shareholder, the Milton Hershey School Trust, controls 80% of the voting shares. The dividend is stable. Its net profit margin is north of 15%.
And it has fantastic brand recognition. There are Hershey Bars, Reese's Cups, Reese's Pieces (the candy preferred by E.T.), Hershey's Cocoa and Jolly Rancher hard candies. It does business in 70 countries.
If Hershey falls, the reason will be simply the price is high and has gone up a lot.
Also, growth stocks, the traditional drivers of market gains, have reasserted themselves.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for example, is up 27% this year after falling 30% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for all of 2018. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up 28.8% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is up more than 35%.
But if the market stumbles, Hershey will become tempting again."
1019,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>","FAA to meet with U.S. airlines, pilot unions on Boeing 737 MAX","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration will hold a meeting Friday with major U.S. airlines that fly now grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes and three major pilots' unions, the agency confirmed.
The meeting with safety representatives from the airlines and unions is set for three hours at FAA headquarters in Washington and will include American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and officials from the three unions.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after nearly 350 people died in two crashes, one in Indonesia in October and one in Ethiopia last month. The FAA is also convening a joint review with aviation regulators from China, Europe, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Ethiopia and other countries.
American and United have canceled flights through early June, while Southwest has canceled flights until the end of May because of the 737 MAX grounding.
Boeing said it has reprogrammed software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes and revised pilot training. On April 1, Boeing said it delayed submitting the proposed revisions to the FAA for approval.
The FAA said the meeting is to help ""the FAA to gather facts, information, and individual views to further understand their views as FAA decides what needs to be done before returning the aircraft to service."" The FAA added it ""continues to gather all available information and data in considering the return of the 737 MAX to service.""
Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association that represents pilots at American Airlines, said he expected the union would be able to ""provide feedback and input regarding pilot training related to the 737 MAX."" The airlines did not immediately comment.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department inspector general’s office and a blue-ribbon panel are also reviewing the plane’s certification and other issues surrounding the 737 MAX.

Lawmakers and the National Transportation Safety Board are also reviewing the FAA's certification process that delegates some tasks to the airplane manufacturers.

Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG data suggest domestic demand kept the German economy chugging along in March, offsetting weakness in exports and increasing the chances that Europe’s engine will avoid a recession.
Passenger traffic for Germany’s dominant carrier rose 4.1 percent in March compared with a year earlier, while cargo haulage dropped 1.1 percent, Lufthansa said Thursday. Although freight flown fell for a third straight month, the decline was less pronounced than in January and February.
The contrast between passenger and cargo numbers suggests Germans are confident enough to spend money on flights amid falling unemployment and rising pay, whereas the nation’s export champions are struggling to find buyers for their products amid global trade tensions.
Germany just managed to avoid slipping into recession in the fourth quarter of last year, when the economy stagnated after contracting in the July-September period. European Central Bank policy makers agree that euro-zone economic growth has held up in line with their official forecasts despite recent weak data, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg Thursday.
While the data reflects demand at Lufthansa’s biggest bases in Frankfurt and Munich, the airline also operates from hubs in Brussels, Zurich and Vienna.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Arrival of Putin's judo partner squeezed Shell out of LNG project - sources,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Olesya Astakhova
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) pulled out of a project to build a Russian liquefied natural gas plant partly because Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) suddenly added another partner with links to an ally of President Vladimir Putin, according to five sources.
After three years work on the Baltic Coast project, Shell discovered that Gazprom was bringing in a company linked to Arkady Rotenberg, who is on a U.S. sanctions blacklist.
The sudden change in the line-up of partners was one of the key factors contributing to Shell's Wednesday announcement that it was pulling out of the project, according to three sources close to Shell and two other sources familiar with the project. 
Asked to comment on the reasons for withdrawing, a Shell spokesman said it had nothing to add to a previous statement that said its exit followed Gazprom's announcement last month of its final concept for the project. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said the company was not commenting.
According to the two sources close to Shell, Gazprom did not consult with Shell about bringing in the firm, which is called RusGazDobycha, but instead presented it with the plan as a fait accompli.
With RusGazDobycha's arrival also came changes to the configuration of the project itself, which Shell did not feel comfortable with, all of the sources said.
It became untenable for Shell to stay in the project ""and that was clear from the moment that Gazprom announced it was going to build the plant together with RusGazDobycha,"" said one of the sources familiar with the project.
A RusGazDobycha official did not respond to a request for comment. Asked if the presidential administration had any role in RusGazDobycha's entry into the project, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the companies involved. 
The sudden shift in the project underlines the unpredictability of doing business in Russia -- even for a firm like Shell with a long pedigree of successful cooperation. It also shows how Rotenberg's business empire, focused mainly on construction and engineering, is expanding into the energy sector. 
Shell said that its other joint projects in Russia -- chief among them the Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2 LNG plant -- would be unaffected by its exit from the Baltic LNG project. 
But Shell's involvement in Sakhalin expires this month. Unless the Russian government decides to extend the Sakhalin deal, Shell's portfolio of Russian projects will be left looking thin. 
The Russian government has given no indication as to whether it would extend Shell's Sakhalin contract. 
""DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE""
One of the problems for Shell was that Rotenberg, a long-standing friend of Putin and his former judo training partner, was under sanctions and that created sanctions risks for Shell too, according to one of the sources close to Shell and the second source familiar with the project.
For Shell, partnering with a Rotenberg-linked firm was tantamount to ""digging yourself your own sanctions grave,"" said that source.
But the other sources said the primary issue for Shell was the change in the configuration of the LNG project.
RusGazDobycha is 100 percent-owned by a firm called National Gas Group (NGG), according to the Spark database, which collates official data from the tax agency and the state statistics agency.
Until November 2016, Rotenberg had a 51 percent stake in NGG, the database shows. The majority owner of NGG now is Artyom Obolensky, who is also chairman of the board of SMP Bank, controlled by Arkady Rotenberg and his brother Boris.
A representative of Arkady Rotenberg, asked about the Baltic LNG project, said Rotenberg ""has no interests in this business.""
The brothers were both added to the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions blacklist in March 2014. 

The sanctions designation stated that the brothers had amassed enormous amounts of wealth during the years of Putin's rule, and that they had received high-price contracts to carry out work for Gazprom and the 2014 Winter Olympic games in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","With 'pop-ups' and menswear, Vuitton aims to keep luxury crown","By Sarah White and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - From New York's Fifth Avenue to Paris' Place Vendome, Louis Vuitton sells its handbags at some of the world's swankiest locations - but the brand is increasingly betting on ""pop-ups"" in off-beat spots as one way to keep shoppers hooked. 
The label, which drives the bulk of sales and profits at French luxury group LVMH, plans to hold 100 temporary events to sell its wares this year, up from 80 last year, the conglomerate's financial director said on Thursday. 
""This is the privileged way and the main way to drive innovation,"" Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts after the conglomerate posted a pick-up in first-quarter sales, beating analyst forecasts.
""This trend in pop-up stores is extremely important, and we will continue to develop that because it enables us to be talking in a different way to our clients ... important and it adds flexibility with our network.""
Vuitton's retail shake-up comes as luxury brands experiment with ways to attract younger shoppers, who are increasingly propelling sales growth in a sector that has long been notoriously rigid in its approach, and slow to move into selling online for instance. 
At the lower-end of the fashion scale, high street labels like H&M are grappling with shifting shopping habits, albeit often taking a different tack, such as sprucing up cluttered stores with a more luxurious feel.
At Vuitton, recent ""pop-ups"" include one in London's exclusive Mayfair neighborhood to highlight its menswear line, with a Wizard of Oz themed space featuring a yellow brick road staircase, and which shoppers had to book tickets to attend. 
With revenues of over 10 billion euros ($11.27 billion), Louis Vuitton is the world's biggest luxury brand by sales, with privately-owned Chanel clipping at its heels, and Kering's star brand Gucci on a mission to overtake it. 
In its bid to stay ahead, Vuitton has also invested in new designers, betting on Virgil Abloh, a DJ and founder of high-end streetwear label Off-White, to help jazz up its mens' clothing lines. 
LVMH, which is notoriously tight-lipped about Vuitton's performance, said on Thursday that the sales' growth rate in men's and womenswear was at a ""very, very high level"" in the first quarter. 
""It's a small part of Vuitton's total business but it creates a lot of buzz and is important to drive store traffic and to help Vuitton sell more accessories,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rogerio Fujimori said of the men's collections. 

Clothing only represents around 5 percent of the brand's sales, the brokerage estimates, with three quarters of revenues coming from high-margin handbags and luggage. ($1 = 0.8875 euros)

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 01:52PM ET</span>",How to say the 'R-word': bank executives grapple with recession talk,"By Elizabeth Dilts and Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Executives at the largest U.S. banks are grappling with how to best talk about the slowing economy and its impact on their businesses as they enter earnings season, people familiar with their thinking told Reuters.
Of particular concern is how to deal with the word ""recession,"" which has become all but verboten as U.S. gross domestic product growth has decelerated.
Although many economists are predicting a downturn, a big bank executive doing so can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, a top banker dismissing recession worries to calm fears could be seen as uninformed or dishonest.
When asked to name the single biggest threat to the U.S. economy at a congressional hearing on Wednesday,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat answered, ""Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recession.""
The ""R word,"" as some are calling it, has been a topic of discussion during earnings planning, executives, investor relations staff and public relations officials said.
There are a few well-tested strategies to reassure investors without misleading them, said Pen Pendleton, founding partner of financial communications firm CLP Strategies in New York, and a former spokesman for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
If a bank is seeing negative signs in its loan book or markets businesses, executives should say something like ""we believe we are competitively positioned in the market place to tackle the challenges,"" Pendleton said. 
An easy way to avoid endorsing any particular outlook is to defer to what in-house bank economists are predicting, he added.
""CEOs are always cautious about commenting on the economic outlook, especially when indicators are negative."" he said.
Even if executives feel obligated to share bad news because of a fiduciary duty to investors, they are likely to hedge what they say, according to an adviser of one of the top 20 banks by assets who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
For example, if loan performance suffered executives might speak optimistically about the future, or chalk it up to a ""one-time thing"" she said.
If top bankers do acknowledge a slowing U.S. economy, they would not be alone. 
The Federal Reserve took a sharply less aggressive posture last month when it signaled it would not hike rates this year and projected slower U.S. growth for 2019. 
While policymakers made clear they saw no recession in the next few years, some cautioned incoming data could change their minds on whether the next move should be to raise or lower rates, meeting minutes showed on Wednesday.
The U.S. economy grew 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 3.6 percent the prior period and 4.2 percent in the middle of last year. 
STOCK DROPS AND TEQUILA SHOTS
Wall Street CEOs and CFOs realize that their words carry a lot of weight, given they manage multi-trillion-dollar balance sheets and have insight into nearly every consumer and institutional lending business. 
Bank stocks can be sensitive to any recession talk that makes headlines. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) shares fell 1.7 percent when finance chief Marianne Lake said that ""recessionary indicators ... are not flashing red, but they are off the floor"" at the bank's investor day in February.
Dimon then helped talk the shares back up, saying the bank's decision not to raise its profitability target was not a warning about the economy and that JPMorgan was not predicting a recession, though it was nonetheless ""prepared for one.""
""In a world of sound bytes it's difficult to be nuanced about recession risk,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) bank analyst Mike Mayo. ""It's a fine line between alarming (markets) and conveying an impression of being recession-ready.""
The pressure to say the right thing can be intense enough to cause sleepless nights, executives and their counselors say. 
Ronn Torossian, head of New York-based 5W Public Relations, said he once spent nearly all night with a senior bank executive rehearsing, taping and listening to prepared remarks for the next day's earnings discussion with analysts.
""I was next to him and he did a shot of tequila a few minutes before the early morning call,"" Torossian said. ""That may have helped more than the training.""
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co will kick off bank results on Friday, followed by Citigroup,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley next week.

1025,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Fastenal Ekes out Earnings Beat; Shares Rally,"Investing.com - Fastenal surged Thursday after the industrial company reported first-quarter earnings that topped expectations thanks to strong demand and higher pricing.
Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) posted earnings of $0.68 a share, a penny above consensus expectations compiled by Investing.com, while revenue of $1.31 billion was in line with estimates, sending its share up more than 4%. The shares are up about 30% this year.
The industrial company, best known as a major distributor of fasteners of all kinds, tools and related supplies, attributed the upbeat performance to growth drivers including industrial vending, construction and onsite locations, which are defined as dedicated sales from within, or close to, a customer's facility.
""Sales through our vending devices grew at a high-teens pace in the first quarter of 2019 over the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to the increase in the installed base,"" the company said.
The company signed 5,603 industrial vending devices during the first quarter, with the installed device count up 13% year on year to 83,410 by March 31.
The uptick in its vending machine fleet comes as Fastenal has been shifting its business model toward on-site locations to better integrate with its customers. The company signed 105 new onsite locations in the first quarter.
Sales of fastener products, meanwhile, grew about 12% on a daily basis year on year and accounted for 35% of sales in the overall first quarter. Non-fastener sales, meanwhile, were up 13% on a daily basis and made up 65% of sales."

While the bank said it recognized that it does not ""yet perform at the level at which it should"", it added that it does not need another strategic overhaul.
Bramson has so far failed in attempts to get the lender to scale back its investment banking activities, which he says have weighed on shareholder returns and run the risk of the bank needing to raise fresh capital. 
Sherborne had on Monday written again to shareholders of Barclays seeking to drum up support for the election of Bramson to the bank's board. It is the third largest shareholder in Barclays with a 5.48 percent stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Sherborne Investors could not be immediately reached for a comment.
Barclays had first revealed in March last year that Bramson had built a stake in the bank.
While Barclays has said it remains committed to its strategy, Chief Executive Jes Staley last month ousted the head of its investment banking division and instead took direct control of the unit, a move referenced in Sherborne's latest letter.
Barclays said on Thursday that Bramson's prior investments and the company's engagement with him suggest ""he would be a disruptive and uncollaborative influence on the board,"" adding that he does not possess the banking experience. 
The bank said it has and would continue to engage with Bramson, but believes that ""Sherborne's interests are not aligned with the wider shareholder base.""

Barclays is due to hold its annual general meeting of shareholders on May 2.

The airline had already grounded more than two thirds of its fleet and Thursday's action suggests its operational fleet size may now be less than 20 planes, according to Reuters calculations, the minimum required under Indian regulations to be able to fly overseas.
A company spokesman said Jet Airways had proactively canceled all west-bound long haul flights from India from Thursday until Friday morning. He would not say whether Jet's operational fleet was now less than 20, only that it was in the double digits.
Saddled with more than $1.2 billion of bank debt, Jet is fighting for survival as it also owes money to lessors, suppliers, pilots and oil companies. 
It has had to ground most of its fleet, while oil companies are tightening fuel supply terms despite efforts by the airline's lenders to find a new investor to bail out the cash-strapped carrier.
Lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), want a new investor to take a stake of up to 75 percent in the airline. Initial bids were to be submitted by the end of Wednesday, but SBI extended the deadline on Wednesday to Friday.

The airline has been forced in recent months to cancel hundreds of flights to several destinations in India and overseas.

About 98 percent of votes at a special meeting were in support of Newmont's proposal to issue new stock to fund its takeover of Goldcorp, the Denver-based company said in a statement. Goldcorp's investors voted to approve the acquisition last week.
The deal, the biggest takeover in the gold sector's history according to Refinitiv data, faced some initial opposition from Newmont investors who said it overly favored Goldcorp shareholders. But they rallied behind the proposal on the promise of a special dividend.
The 88-cent-per-share special dividend will be paid on May 1 to those who hold Newmont shares as of April 17, according to the statement. 
Newmont shares were 0.7 percent lower at $36.01 in morning trading in New York, in line with the benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index. Goldcorp shares slipped 0.26 percent to C$15.41 in Toronto. 
""We thank Newmont’s shareholders for their overwhelming support for this compelling value creation opportunity as we build the world’s leading gold company,"" Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in the statement.
The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, will overtake current market leader Barrick Gold Corp in annual production, churning out 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years, compared with Barrick's forecast of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces for 2019.
Newmont Goldcorp expects to shed between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of assets to focus on its most promising operations. This, combined with mines Barrick plans to sell in the wake of its acquisition of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS), is expected by analysts to fuel a flurry of deals in a sector that has been focused on cutting costs rather than pursuing growth for several years.
Newmont's acquisition of Goldcorp had faced several hurdles, beginning with Barrick's hostile takeover bid for Newmont in February, which required it to abandon its deal with Goldcorp.

That was resolved through the creation of a joint venture of Newmont and Barrick's operations in Nevada, which was estimated to create $4.7 billion in synergies.

Shares of Keurig fell 3.75%, while the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector was flat.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut the stock to underweight from equal weight and dropped its price target to $24 from $27.
The brokerage said it predicts revenue below corporate guidance due to lower household penetration of its coffee-making systems and pricing pressure on its coffee pods.
The stock has rebounded recently from a sharp drop in late February after the company missed on revenue expectations and issued weaker guidance, even weathering a report on a medical study that said drinking sugary sodas could contribute to colon cancer.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 11:12AM ET</span>","Huawei says its equipment as secure as any, pans U.S. campaign","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies said on Thursday the security of its telecoms network equipment was as tight as any, and hit back at the U.S. government for briefing Washington's allies against it.
Huawei, the global market leader, is the target of a campaign by Washington, which has barred it from next-generation 5G networks due to concerns over its ties to the Chinese government and says Western countries should block its technology.
The issue is crucial because of 5G's leading role in internet-connected products ranging from self-driving cars and smart cities to augmented reality and artificial intelligence. 
""We are probably the most tested vendor in the world,"" Huawei's cybersecurity director Sophie Batas told journalists at its new cybersecurity center in Brussels.
She criticized comments by Robert Strayer, U.S. State Department deputy assistant secretary for cyber, international communications and information policy, who told journalists on Wednesday that countries adopting risk-based security frameworks for 5G would lead to Huawei being banned.
""I have difficulty believing that a government like the United States organized a press conference yesterday to single out one particular company, and I wonder why it is going so far,"" she said.
The two countries are also embroiled in a long-running trade dispute.
Batas said there were a range of tests customers could do on Huawei products at the center and similar facilities in several countries, as well as hiring independent third party evaluators.
She said law firms Zhong Lun, Clifford Chance and Ernst & Young had looked into China's intelligence laws and concluded that did not allow Beijing to install backdoor features in a company's equipment.

Last month, Germany set tougher criteria for vendors supplying telecoms network equipment there, but stopped short of singling out Huawei, instead saying the same rules should apply to all vendors.

The company was criticized recently by activist investor Jonathan Litt who, according to media reports, has urged Marriott to consider culling its 30 brands to better align itself with competitors such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.
Marriott's Global Chief Commercial Officer Stephanie Linnartz, however, said the group aimed to keep expanding across all sectors of the market, especially in Asia.
""We're focused on growing multiple tiers (in Asia Pacific), not just luxury... we're also excited about growing our Courtyard brand in China,"" Linnartz told Reuters on Thursday. 
Mid-scale brands like Courtyard are Marriott's fastest-growing segment in Asia Pacific, the company said.
Linnartz was speaking to Reuters during a visit to Hong Kong, where the group opened its first St Regis in the city on Wednesday.
Last month Marriott announced plans to open more than 1,700 hotels globally as part of its three-year growth strategy. It has more than 300 hotels in China in the pipeline for the next three to five years and plans to have all 30 of its brands operating in the Asia Pacific region eventually, up from 23 at present.
The number of brands was one of the group's greatest strengths, Linnartz said.
""Because you have so much breadth and choice. We see in our data that, last year, half of the people who stayed in W globally, also stayed in Courtyard, why? Because people will stay in one brand for business trip, and they want to go on their romantic vacation with their spouse.""
The St Regis in Hong Kong is Marriott's 7,000th property globally. The company also plans to bring the JW Marriott Marquis brand to China later this year, and the Tribute Portfolio brand into India. 
""We need to be careful to bring what brand into what market, not just the country, but the city. You have to really think about the right consumer demand - is that a luxury market or not?"" Linnartz said.

The U.S is ""looking very closely"" at the deal after Republicans and Democrats said on Wednesday they were concerned it violated the agreement.
Qatar Airways bought a stake in Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non-stop U.S. destinations from Milan. 
Qatar Airways said the stake was ""fully compliant"" with the 2018 U.S.-Qatar Understandings, an additional pact that accompanied the U.S-Qatar Open Skies agreement. 
Since 2015 the largest U.S carriers - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition.
Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year separate voluntary agreements were reached between the U.S. and Qatar, and the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates to address the concerns. Measures included the airlines not adding new flights to the U.S.
However, Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May.
Qatar Airways said in a statement its investment in Air Italy, which closed in September 2017, preceded the 2018 agreement but complied with it.
It said its investments in other airlines were not raised as a point of concern during the discussions that led to the 2018 agreement and that the deal does not mention or prohibit cross-border investments.

Qatar Airways also said it did not codeshare on Air Italy's flights to the U.S. and has no plans to do so.

The company expects current quarter same-store sales to fall between 5 and 6 percent. 
This, after the retailer said its turnaround initiatives including its experimental store formats, investments in its decorative furnishing business and digital platforms would drive its revenue growth and gross margin in mid and long term. 
""(Q1) comp outlook (is) the largest rate of decline in the company's history,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernandez. The retailer also reported its first annual sales decline since it went public in 1992. 
Bed Bath and Beyond has been struggling to boost sales in the face of changing consumer preferences toward online furniture retailers such as Wayfair Inc. It is, in fact, under pressure from a trio of activist investors to put things in order and replace its chief executive officer. 
Comparable sales in fourth quarter fell 1.4 percent, below analysts' expectations, hurt by mid-single digit drop in sales at its brick and mortar stores which overshadowed strong growth from digital channels.
""Shares are down as investors digest the reality that a sustained trend of declines in brick & mortar (comparable sales) ...suggest an inflection in fundamentals is not in the near-term horizon,"" said Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski.
""The transformation plan sounds reasonable, though transparency issues are lingering and execution remains the big question mark,"" Matuszewski added. 
Though the company raised its full-year profit guidance, analysts pointed out that profitability is coming at the cost of sales growth. 
Wedbush analyst Seth Basham hiked his price target by $5 to $19, but kept a ""neutral"" rating on the stock, citing the company's ""murky medium-term fundamental outlook and no clear path to more material activist-driven change.""
Bed bath and Beyond has a median price target of $18 and median rating of ""hold"" on the stock.
Short interest in the stock has climbed to a more than five-year high, representing about 35 percent of the company's free float, according to Refinitiv data. 

Shares of Bed Bath and Beyond have risen about 40 percent since the activist investor group comprising Legion Partners Asset Management LLC, Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC disclosed a combined stake of about 5 stake in the company.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Germans in Swiss 'cum-ex' trial given suspended sentences,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Three Germans on trial in Switzerland for helping expose a tax-stripping scheme that cost European governments billions of euros will likely avoid prison after a verdict on Thursday that fell well short of prosecutors' demands.
The men, Stuttgart-based lawyer Eckart Seith and two former employees of Basel-based Bank J. Safra Sarasin, had faced up to 3-1/2 years in prison for numerous charges. Instead, they got suspended fines and jail terms for violating banking secrecy.
""The Zurich District Court condemns three persons, accused of transferring a bank customer list to a German lawyer, for multiple violations of the banking law,"" the court said in a statement, adding one banker was also found guilty of industrial espionage and coercion. 
The defendants were acquitted of all other charges, the court said.
Seith could not be reached immediately for comment. He told German newspaper FAZ he would lodge an appeal.
The case, in which prosecutors said the accused passed secret Swiss bank documents to German authorities, is linked to the border-crossing fraud investigation into so-called ""cum-ex trades"" in which financial powerhouses including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are under scrutiny. 
In the 2001-2011 scheme, European governments were duped into believing a stock had multiple owners, each entitled to a dividend and a tax credit. Germany, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and other countries lost tax revenue that instead benefited wealthy investors.
The Zurich trial was linked to German drug chain billionaire Erich Mueller, a Bank Sarasin client who lost around 50 million euros ($56 million) in 2012 on cum-ex trades after German tax officials balked at paying him a tax credit. 
Mueller, seeking to recoup his money from Sarasin, hired Seith and worked with the two German bankers, both of whom spent time in investigative custody in Switzerland.
In 2017, a German court ruled Bank Sarasin had to pay 45 million euros to Mueller. Sarasin's ex-deputy chief executive, Eric Sarasin, in 2016 also paid a settlement in Germany.
Switzerland, the world's largest offshore wealth center, last year began sharing bank data with many foreign tax authorities, bowing to international pressure to help crack down on tax cheats.
Still, the Zurich case shows the nation continues to move aggressively against people who pass on bank information to foreign individuals or governments.

Meanwhile, German media have celebrated Seith for helping expose the cum-ex scheme.

PARIS/LYON (Reuters) - A French appeals court ruled on Thursday that Bayer's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) business was liable for the health problems of a farmer who had inhaled a weedkiller product.
The ruling in favor of farmer Paul Francois was announced in a statement by a plaintiffs group. A Bayer (DE:BAYGN) spokeswoman in France also confirmed the ruling.
""We take note of the decision in favor of Mr Francois and are studying the full ruling,"" the spokeswoman said.
Francois, who says he suffered neurological problems after accidentally inhaling the Lasso weedkiller in 2004, accused Monsanto of not providing adequate safety warnings.
In a decade-long legal battle, Francois won rulings against Monsanto in 2012 and 2015, before France's top court overturned those decisions and ordered a new hearing.
The latest ruling on Thursday, however, did not determine compensation for the farmer.
The appeals court referred the matter to another court in the southeastern city of Lyon, the ""Phyto-victimes"" plantiffs group said. The group represents workers who claim health problems due to exposure to pesticides.
The ruling in the French case comes as Monsanto faces lawsuits in the United States over alleged cancer links to its glyphosate-based weedkillers.
Lasso was banned in France in 2007 after the product had already been withdrawn in some other countries. 
It used a different active substance to glyphosate, the chemical contained in Monsanto's best-selling weedkiller Roundup and the target of lawsuits in the United States.

The legal troubles surrounding glyphosate have contributed to Bayer losing about 30 billion euros from its market value since last August. The German group's chief executive said on Thursday it was ""massively affected"" by the litigation.

The 51-year-old former military flight test engineer and auto executive announced the changes in his first full day in the role after the retirement of Tom Enders.
""We are in a period of exceptional change in our industry and we need to prepare Airbus for the opportunities and challenges ahead,"" Faury said in a statement.
""We will utilize new digital technologies to optimize our industrial system,"" he added.
Airbus unveiled a new management structure with a 12-person executive committee eliminating a separate president for the planemaking division, which makes up the bulk of company profits and revenues and which Faury had been running for the past year.
It lifted engineering, communications and sales to the management top table and appeared to sideline procurement, which had previously been represented on the main executive body.
Faury was formally appointed on Wednesday after rising through the helicopters unit to jetliners via a four-year R&D leadership role in the auto industry at Peugeot maker PSA Group.
Airbus celebrates its 50th anniversary as a planemaker this year and its 20th since the announcement of a pan-European merger that resulted in the creation of a wider Franco-German aerospace group, now integrated into Airbus itself.

Analysts say the latest transition coincides with a shift away from an obsession with market-share battles with rival Boeing in earlier years, to one focusing on production methods imported increasingly from the car industry as output rises.

This will be the biggest departure from the third-largest U.S. bank's executive team since former consumer banking head Manuel Medina-Mora left three years ago.
Forese, 56, had told acquaintances that he was frustrated and unhappy, sources told Reuters.
Forese, who began overseeing the business in 2011, is the second-highest paid executive at the bank after Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat. 
He will be succeeded by Paco Ybarra, the global head of markets and securities services. Ybarra had been serving as Forese's deputy since October 2018, and will take over his role on May 1.
Forese's unit, which includes treasury services, the investment bank, corporate lending capital markets, delivered 50 percent of revenue and more than two thirds of profit for the bank last year.
His division fell short of annual targets in 2018 and Forese was the only executive on the operating committee not to receive a raise for the year, according a recent filing.
Forese retires after having spent his entire career at the firm. He came to the company through Salomon Brothers, which he joined in 1985, and cut his teeth in the securities trading business, eventually working his way up to become head of the markets division.

LONDON (Reuters) - Airline stocks helped European shares advance on Thursday after European Union leaders gave Britain another six months to leave the bloc, while sterling simply shrugged. 
Gains for airlines from easyJet (LON:EZJ) to Lufthansa helped European indexes gain 0.2 percent, with the EU's Brexit extension to Oct. 31 clearing some of the uncertainty previously clouding the key summer holiday period.
The summit deal in Brussels, struck in the early hours of Thursday, means that Britain will not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a treaty - though it offers scant clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen.
Markets in London and Frankfurt ticked up and Paris outperformed as luxury stocks also gained ground, even with concern over protectionism rumbling and markets digesting central bank warnings over slowing growth.
Futures indicate that Wall Street was set to open higher, a turnaround for global equities after a disappointing day in Asia, where four consecutive days of gains ground to a halt. 
The dollar and euro held steady.
Equities and other risky assets have been volatile this year, while bonds have rallied over worries of a slowdown in the United States and other major economies, including the euro zone. Many central banks have taken a dovish stance, pivoting away from moves toward interest rate increases. 
The Federal Reserve will likely leave U.S. rates unchanged this year, minutes from its policy meeting last month showed, given risks to the U.S. economy from financial conditions and protectionist trade policies. 
The European Central Bank maintained its loose policy stance on Wednesday, highlighting threats to global growth and raising the prospect of more support being pumped into the struggling euro zone economy.
Looming in the background has been concern over a retreat to protectionism, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening new tariffs on EU while the Sino-U.S. trade dispute rumbles on.
The world's two biggest economies have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach, including establishing new ""enforcement offices"", U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, with talks due to resume on Thursday.
""We do expect U.S. growth to remain relatively tepid this year compared to what we saw last year, and it will probably lose further momentum as we head toward the end of the year,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets

European trading was thin, a trend likely to continue during upcoming disrupted trading weeks in major markets. Easter lies ahead and Japan is due for a 10-day break from late April to mark the ascension of its new emperor. 
STERLING STEADY
Major currencies struggled, with the dollar hanging near two-week lows and the euro unmoved.
But most notably sterling was unchanged below $1.31, remaining within the trading range it has held to during the past month or so.
Markets now see less chance Britain will crash out of the EU, so the focus of traders will turn - for the coming months at least - to the underlying state of the British economy, said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""People have been focused on Brexit ... In the short-term, maybe these investors or traders will look more at the economic fundamentals,"" she said.
Rising U.S. crude stocks dragged oil lower, though prices found a floor as OPEC-led cuts and plunging Venezuelan output tightened global supplies.

So it’s little wonder, then, that this article from Bloomberg News’s Adam Tempkin drew a lot of interested bond traders: “Inflated Credit Scores Leave Investors in the Dark on Real Risks.” In it, analysts from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Moody’s Analytics argue that FICO credit scores from Fair Isaac Corp. have been artificially inflated over the past decade and don’t reflect borrowers’ true ability to pay what they owe in the event of a downturn.
“Every credit model that just relies on credit score now -- and there’s a lot of them -- is possibly understating the risk,” Goldman Sachs analyst Marty Young said in an interview. “There are a whole bunch of other variables, including the business cycle, that need to be taken into account.”
The concern that’s come up, Goldman and Moody’s say, is that lenders haven’t adjusted their underwriting standards as average credit scores have risen during one of the longest economic recoveries on record. So as cracks start to appear in the economy, someone whose credit score rose to 650 from 550 since the Great Recession may pay their bills more like they did 10 years earlier.
“Borrowers’ scores may have migrated up, but inherently their individual risk, and their attitude towards credit and ability to pay their bills, has stayed the same.”
This is stating the obvious and doesn’t suggest any sort of sinister grade inflation. The U.S. economic recovery that began 10 years ago has pushed the unemployment rate to about its lowest in half a century. Average hourly earnings are rising at the fastest pace since the recession ended. It follows that a number of Americans who were previously jobless now bring in a steady income and have higher credit scores. That, in turn, affords them greater access to credit.
So, what’s the problem? Cris deRitis, deputy chief economist at Moody’s, says he’s concerned about “smaller, less sophisticated firms that lend to people with poor credit histories.” He added that “car loans, retail credit cards and personal loans handed out online are the most exposed to the inflated scores.” Tempkin notes that there’s about $400 billion of that kind of debt outstanding, with a quarter of it bundled into securities that investors now hold.
I realize companies that cater to weaker borrowers can serve a vital function. Some subprime borrowers simply need a lifeline to get their finances back in order. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon even said in congressional testimony this week that when it comes to mortgages, loosening constraints on lending to people with low incomes or prior defaults could single-handedly boost U.S. economic growth by 0.2 percent.
Still, forgive me for not shedding a tear for firms that don’t look beyond FICO scores, or for investors who snapped up high-yielding asset-backed securities. 
In February, I looked at subprime auto loans and concluded that they’re far from a systemic risk, even though more more than 7 million Americans were at least three months behind on their car payments, the most ever. The most at-risk lenders include names like Global Lending Services, GO Financial and Skopos Financial. As I said then: “If the worst-case scenario is that some private-equity backed new entrants to the auto-loan business close shop, and investors who were reaching for yield get burned, that doesn’t seem so bad.”
The hand-wringing over FICO scores feels very much the same. Goldman attributes the growing number of delinquent auto loans to the general increase in credit scores. But again, it comes back to who’s doing the lending. Large banks certainly use more than just FICO scores to determine whom they choose to underwrite and at what terms. There’s a reason for that, and it probably has precisely to do with scores looking rosy during good economic times. 
It’s not even as if FICO pretends to be a perfect reflection of a borrower’s creditworthiness. From Tempkin’s piece:
“The relationship between FICO score and delinquency levels can and does shift over time,” said Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of scores and predictive analytics at FICO. “We recognize there’s a lot more context you can obtain beyond a consumer’s credit file. We do not think that score inflation is the issue, but the risk layering on underwriting factors outside of credit scores, such as DTI, loan terms, and even trends in macroeconomic cycles, for example.”
It’s not hard to come up with ways to alleviate concerns about elevated FICO scores. Lenders can require a broader range of information before extending credit, or they can simply bump up their FICO thresholds to account for the prolonged business cycle. The same goes for investors in asset-backed securities. They could easily just be more selective in what they purchase. But with the Federal Reserve no longer raising interest rates and the reach for yield back in style, that doesn’t seem likely. If the bundles of loans turn bad, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.
It’s tempting to look for signs of stress now that the U.S. economy is on the verge of the longest expansion in history. And it’s true that private-label credit cards and online loans are seeing an uptick in missed payments. But just as the inverted yield curve served as a reminder that all business cycles must end (though not necessarily imminently), these delinquent payments are simply a call for lenders and investors to get smarter.

UniCredit said on Wednesday night that it was one of the banks targeted by the probe. 
The European Commission in January revealed that some traders at eight unnamed banks had exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies in euro-denominated bonds.
Asked about the significance of the probe for UniCredit, the bank's Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier told reporters: ""If you knew what I know, you'd use the name of a Shakespeare play, it's ""Much ado about nothing.""
Mustier declined to comment on reports that his bank would be interested in merging its German unit HVB with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) if merger talks between Commerzbank and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) failed.
He said Europe needed big banks, but cross-board mergers were extremely difficult to pull off and the probability of any combination was low.

""Don't hold your breath,"" he said.

Chairman Stefan Schmittmann was reacting to reports in recent days that some board members were pushing Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) to end merger talks with rival  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and push CEO Martin Zielke from office.
""Rumors and speculation on personnel changes are made up out of thin air,"" Schmittmann said in a statement emailed to Reuters. ""Such allegations are irresponsible and unworthy of discussion.""
Germany's Manager Magazin was one of the news organizations that reported on a rebellion, writing on Wednesday that the push was coming from board members who represent employees.
Schmittmann said that Commerzbank ""must explore"" the option to merge with Deutsche. ""I think that's right and it's their duty,"" he added.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has told his counterpart at Commerzbank that he wants more time to consider a merger.
The two banks announced merger talks on March 17. If successful, they would create Europe's third-largest bank from Germany's top two lenders, which have struggled to recover since the financial crisis.
Government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the future of the two banks.
A tie-up between the lenders is an enormous undertaking because both are already in the midst of restructuring, some bankers and regulators have said, adding that a merger would not necessarily solve Deutsche's core weakness, its sprawling global investment bank.
From the start, some major investors have expressed scepticism about a deal, while unions have warned of 30,000 potential job losses. 
Days after the talks were announced, Zielke promised the bank's employees a quick decision on whether to go forward with a merger, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The Commerzbank workers' council then sent a letter to board members to protest against the merger, saying the idea lacked support among workers, customers and society. 
""We are of the opinion that you will fall into an uncontrollable adventure without a solid plan, without a vision and without support,"" the letter said.
Zielke subsequently met seven employees on the 47th floor of the bank's Frankfurt tower to quell concerns and explain his stance.

""The alternative of doing nothing is not an option,"" he said, according to comments posted on the bank's intranet and seen by Reuters.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Latvia pledges faster money laundering reform as pressure builds,"By John O'Donnell and Gederts Gelzis
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Latvia's prime minister has promised to accelerate an overhaul of the banking sector as fears grow that money laundering scandals could single the country out as high risk, prompting Swedish lenders to leave and isolating the Baltic state.
In an interview with Reuters, Krisjanis Karins said he would take earlier reforms a step further and change rules on management appointments at the country's banking regulator, while granting it the power to close banks with ""dirty money"".
""We are giving out a signal to those individuals or companies looking for a place to launder money,"" said Karins, who took over as prime minister in January. ""We are saying we are not open for business."" 
Early last year, U.S. authorities accused Latvia’s third biggest bank, ABLV, of money laundering and breaking sanctions on North Korea, prompting its closure and triggering the country's worst financial crisis in a decade.
Latvia now faces a review by international money-laundering standards watchdog Moneyval in coming months, which some officials fear could label the country as risky, alongside the likes of Serbia and Pakistan.
The body issued a highly critical assessment of Latvia last year, citing corruption, vulnerability to international organized crime and exposure to corruption in neighboring former soviet states. 
Acknowledging the threat of what officials call grey-listing, Karins said the country was serious about tackling corruption and financial crime, appealing directly to Swedish banks not to lose faith.
Swedbank has been drawn into a Baltic money laundering scandal that has wiped billions of euros off its market value, prompting fears among some Latvian officials that it could follow Danish rival Danske in leaving the area.
""These banks are important to our region. They are important to our financial stability,"" Karins said.
""My message to them is very simple. They can rest assured that we are creating a very resilient system.""
A spokesman for Swedbank said that it would ""continue to be the bank for the many households and corporates"" in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
SEB Chairman Marcus Wallenberg recently said the region would remain an ""important part"" of future strategy.
GREY MONEY
Latvia's finance minister, Janis Reirs, who visited Washington this week to outline his country's progress to top U.S. officials, said investigating and prosecuting of financial crime would improve. 
He met Marshall Billingslea, who leads the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes at the U.S. Treasury, according to officials.
""This grey money is one of the main feeding sources for corruption,"" Reirs told Reuters.
The stakes are high for one of Europe's poorest countries. While Latvia's economy is growing, Morten Hansen, of the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, said any grey-listing could hit its credit rating, risking a recession.
Nonetheless, the push by the new government, built on a fragile coalition of five parties, to reinvigorate reforms faces obstacles, including open divisions between lawmakers and the institutions tasked with policing banks.
Peters Putnins, who heads the Financial and Capital Market Commission, which supervises banks, said the government's reforms amounted to political interference in his work and were a veiled attempt to oust him.
""This is reorganization ... to change the ... staff of the supervisory board of the commission,"" he told Reuters. ""The banking supervision must be independent. If this is not political interference, what is this?""
Since Latvia secured independence from Russia in 1991, more than a dozen of its banks have promoted themselves as a gateway to Western markets for clients in former Soviet states, promising Swiss-style secrecy.
That policy has now been abandoned under pressure from the U.S. and despite predictions by Latvian officials a year ago that many would close, the banks are still open. 
Karins said the sector has been cleaned up but changing its approach to banking is still a difficult balancing act for Latvia.
Washington is an important military ally for the former Soviet-ruled state of 2 million people on the EU’s eastern flank. It also has close historical and trade ties with Russia. 

Karins appealed for a joint European effort to tackle money laundering, criticizing the ""patchwork"" of laws around the region. ""It's a European problem,"" he said. ""Banks in this region have been used ... as transit runs.""

BOSTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) will put a focus on human rights in Myanmar under an agreement with an investor group that had urged it to pay more attention to violence in the Asian nation where the U.S. oil company has operations.
Chevron will undertake steps including social investment reviews in Myanmar's Rakhine State, donate to humanitarian organizations for Rohingya refugees, and help develop practices for companies operating amid risks of crimes against humanity, according to a letter signed by a company executive. 
Azzad Asset Management, an activist investor that submitted a shareholder resolution calling on Chevron to report on its business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity, agreed to withdraw the proposal, according to a copy of the agreement viewed by Reuters.
""Chevron appreciates Azzad's constructive engagement and commends them for recognizing our actions related to human rights,"" Mary Francis, Chevron's governance officer who signed the letter, said in an emailed statement. Francis declined to be interviewed.
A similar resolution was opposed by the company at previous shareholder meetings and last year won support from just 7% of votes cast according to a securities filing.
Joshua Brockwell, investment communications director at Virginia-based Azzad, which describes itself as ""a faith-based socially responsible investment firm offering halal investment portfolios,"" said the agreement ""demonstrates positive steps forward after years of dialogue.""
Rakhine State came to global attention in 2017 when the Myanmar army drove about 730,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims across the border and into neighboring Bangladesh, following attacks by Rohingya insurgents on police posts. U.S. and United Nations officials have decried the crackdown as a form of genocide.
More recently, the military has been battling another armed rebel group, the Arakan Army, which draws recruits mostly from the ethnic Rakhine population, who are mainly Buddhists, and is fighting for greater autonomy for the western state.
Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have spent more than 15 months in detention since they were arrested in December 2017 while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslim civilians involving Myanmar soldiers.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co, according to Chevron's website. Its projects there include a minority interest in natural gas production and in a pipeline company.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 05:48AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ghosn, suffering from kidney failure, was arrested illegally - defense document","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's ""illegal"" arrest has interrupted his care for chronic kidney failure, which the former Nissan Motor boss suffers from as a result of treatment for high cholesterol, his defense said in documents seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Ghosn's defense team, in documents prepared after their client was arrested for the fourth time by Tokyo prosecutors last week - and the details of which have not been previously reported - allege the latest arrest was designed to interrupt the defense's preparation and force a confession.
Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Prosecutors re-arrested Ghosn last Thursday at his Tokyo residence where he had been staying since his release on $9 million bail, returning him to the detention center where he previously spent more than 100 days.
Authorities arrested Ghosn on suspicion of enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan, having already charged him for financial misconduct.
Before the latest arrest, Ghosn - once one of the world's most-feted auto executives for his rescue of Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago - denied all allegations against him and said he was the victim of a boardroom coup.
""This arrest is illegal,"" the defense said in one of the documents, dated April 5, the day after he was re-arrested.
Ghosn has high cholesterol and, as a result of treatment, suffers from chronic kidney failure and rhabdomyolysis, the defense said. Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome where muscle fibers release their contents into the blood stream.
Interrupting his treatment for the ""convenience of prosecutors' investigation"" was ""inhuman"", the defense said.
'INHUMAN ACTIONS'
The documents also include an account from Ghosn's wife, Carole, who said prosecutors prevented her from contacting her lawyer on the morning of her husband's re-arrest.
She said she was repeatedly subjected to body checks, forced to keep the bathroom door open when using the toilet, and that a female investigator was present in the bathroom when she undressed to take a shower.
""I felt that they were humiliating and coercing me with these inhuman actions,"" Carole Ghosn said in her account, dated April 4, the day of her husband's re-arrest.
Following the arrest, Carole Ghosn went to France to seek help from the French government. Her husband is a French, Brazilian and Lebanese national.
She has since returned to Japan and on Thursday was questioned by prosecutors at the Tokyo District Court, the Kyodo news agency reported.
Prosecutors are questioning Carlos Ghosn for as much as 14 hours a day, sometimes in the middle of the night, said a person with knowledge of the conditions of Ghosn's detention, and who was not permitted to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified.

The development is likely to renew focus on what has been characterized in the West as Japan's unduly harsh judicial system - a system branded ""hostage justice"" by critics and defended by local authorities.

""We have lost two cases in lower courts. That is why the company is massively affected. You see it in our share price,"" CEO Werner Baumann said in a panel discussion at an academic business event in Cologne.
""You see it selectively, mainly here in Germany and in France - less so in the USA - in our reputational scores,"" he added.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) has seen about 30 billion euros ($34 billion) wiped off its market value since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), acquired by Bayer for $63 billion last year, had not warned of weedkiller Roundup's alleged cancer risks. 
It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 10,000 cases are pending.
""There's lots of politicking, campaigning and propaganda that goes entirely against the current regulatory status of our products. That has prompted U.S. lawyers to sue for damages - a big industry in the USA - following an outlier assessment of the potential risk by a subordinate organization,"" Baumann added.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators across the globe have found that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is not likely carcinogenic to humans.
However, the World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"".

Bayer is legally challenging the verdicts and has stressed that regulators across the globe have found the product to be safe.

Credit Suisse's markets business was profitable in 2018 on an adjusted basis, and is expected to break-even in the first quarter despite ""very challenging market conditions,"" it said, citing estimates and management expectations.
The bank is due to report its first quarter results on April 24.

Sommerhalder, who joined the Swiss bank in 2002, has worked previously in senior positions in the bank's sales and trading businesses. He is a member of the management committee for the global markets and international wealth management units.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest lender UniCredit said it is among a group of banks accused of running a cartel in trading euro zone government bonds between 2007 and 2012, years when financial crises dragged down banks and several European countries.
UniCredit made the disclosure on Wednesday night at the request of Italy's market watchdog, more than two months after the European Commission revealed that some traders at eight unnamed banks had exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies in euro-denominated bonds.
UniCredit said the commission suspected some of its subsidiaries had violated anti-trust rules and that it might be slapped with a cash fine, though it deemed this unlikely. EU rules allow for a fine of up to 10 percent of global turnover.
The bank's shares were down 1.7 percent in morning trade.
Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier declined to comment on the matter as he arrived for the bank's annual shareholder meeting in Milan on Thursday morning.
""I have nothing to say,"" he told a reporter who asked if the bank would make financial contingency plans for a potential EU fine.
UniCredit said in a statement: ""On the basis of the current information, it is not possible to reliably estimate the amount of any potential fine."". It has until April 29 to raise objections to the commission's allegations.
The commission revealed in January that the alleged bond cartel had been run by some traders mainly via online chatrooms, saying its charges did not imply that anti-competitive conduct was a general practice in the euro zone government bond sector.
European banks have already paid out billions of euros in fines, including for rigging interest rate benchmarks used to price home loans.

In a separate, earlier case, the commission charged  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and a fourth bank in December with being part of a bond cartel, also citing traders using chatrooms.

(Reuters) - British fashion retailer Ted Baker named a company veteran as its boss on Thursday, also introducing changes to workplace standards as it looked to draw a line under misconduct allegations against founder and outgoing CEO Ray Kelvin.
Ted Baker said interim head Lindsay Page, who joined as finance director in 1997, would take over as chief executive officer with immediate effect.
Kelvin, who had been CEO since the company's launch in 1988, resigned last month over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". 
The company said an independent panel had ended its investigation into the allegations involving Kelvin and recommended changes to the workplace culture - including a review of HR procedures and a whistleblowers' hotline - which it would implement.
It said it would not comment on the claims against Kelvin, who has denied all allegations of misconduct. 
He remains the company's biggest shareholder with just under 35 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Ted Baker's stock fell 43 percent in value in 2018, and last month it reported its first drop in annual profit since the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting the tough conditions on Britain's high streets.
Its shares rose 2.2 percent to 1,521 pence after Thursday's statement. 
""The appointment of Lindsay Page as CEO and the conclusion of the HSF investigation should now draw a line in the sand in what has been an unfortunate process,"" Liberum analysts said. 
""His (Page's) appointment makes imminent sense and represents the smoothest of all transitions to a person that has (an) incredibly long pedigree at Ted Baker.""
LEARNING LESSONS
Retailers are facing a perfect storm of rising costs, slowing growth and the hit to uncertainty spurred by Britain's chaotic departure from the European Union. 
Ted Baker, which opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 and now has more than 500 outlets and concessions globally, had however reported solid Christmas sales, with the quirky detailing on its suits, shirts and dresses helping the company stand out from rivals.
""Questions have been raised about the loss of creativity now Kelvin has gone,"" said Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst at brokerage  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""But Ted Baker is a company worth more than half a billion pounds, it’s not solely reliant on the flair of just one man.""
It said it had renewed training for all employees on HR policies and procedures and on acceptable workplace conduct.
The company will also maintain an independent and confidential whistleblowing hotline and enhance oversight of both people and cultural matters at board level.
""We are determined to learn from this process and, moving forward, cultivate a better environment for all employees where they always feel respected and valued,"" Executive Chairman David Bernstein said.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Lyft's stock slide casts long shadow on Uber's IPO,"By Joshua Franklin and David Randall
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc may face a cooler reception from investors than expected when it prices its initial public offering next month since smaller U.S. ride-hailing rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's aggressive stock launch and subsequent fall. 
Lyft's IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion. But the stock has languished since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startup's potential for profitability have become more prominent. 
Lyft shares ended on Wednesday down 11 percent at $60.12, well below their $72 IPO price. Lyft was the first in a string of technology IPOs expected this year, including food delivery service Postmates and smart exercise bike Peleton. 
Lyft's poor stock performance bodes ill for these IPOs, especially for companies like Uber with no profits to show. 
""There's no discernable way these companies are valued. What you're really buying into is the long-term ability of the company to capture lots of sales and hopefully get profitable at some point,"" said Brian Hamilton, founder of data firm Sageworks. 
""I'm sure that the Lyft debut is going to affect both Uber and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS),"" Hamilton added. 
Uber filed for its IPO in December with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the same week as Lyft. But it let Lyft go first with its offering, partly because it was working on a new private fundraising round for its autonomous driving unit.
Uber is now paying the price of going second. It is planning to seek a valuation between $90 billion and $100 billion, short of the $120 billion investment bankers previously told the company it could be worth in an IPO, Reuters reported on Tuesday. 
Image sharing app  Pinterest Inc  this week also set the terms for its IPO which would value the company at up to $11.3 billion, below its latest fundraising round which valued it at $12 billion in 2017. Prior to Lyft going public, Pinterest had been weighing a valuation at or near the last fundraising round, according to a source familiar with the matter. Pinterest declined to comment. 
Uber is expected to make its detailed financial results public on Thursday. It lost $3.3 billion last year, excluding one-off gains, while Lyft lost $911 million for 2018. Pinterest also lost $62.97 million in 2018.
Uber declined to comment. 
GETTING GREEDY
Investors and analysts said technology unicorn IPOs are losing their luster, not just because more investors are asking tough questions about their prospects, but because the startups overestimated pent-up demand for their offerings.
""Lyft wanted to be first... and it got to a point where they got so aggressive with their pricing and they got kind of greedy,"" said Catherine McCarthy, an Allianz Global Investors research analyst. 
The pressure to become profitable will ratchet up once these companies become public, said Jordan Stuart, a portfolio manager for Federated Kaufmann funds who often purchases companies' stock in the IPO.
""The pace of change is happening so quickly that you have to show that you can become profitable quickly,"" Stuart said. 

""Some of these companies could go away tomorrow because it's just an app on my phone and I can find another one in a second to get to work or have food delivered.""

Investing.com -- It’s been a tough 12 months for most sectors in Europe’s stock market. Exporters of capital goods have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war, banks and financial services hobbled by negative interest rates, consumer stocks struggling to escape the shackles of low wage growth and demographic decline.
But one sector has been a relatively constant bright light, and it’s leading the way again this Thursday. Luxury goods makers are roaring ahead after another strong quarter for LVMH (PA:LVMH), the French drinks-to-fashion group.
LVMH announced after the bell on Wednesday that its revenue grew 16% on the year in the first quarter and said the positive trends that had helped it to a record year in 2018 were still in place. Most remarkably, in a world economy that is supposedly suffering a synchronized slowdown, the group said that “all geographic regions are experiencing good growth.”
The news has sent the stock up 3.1% on a day when most indexes are down, due in part to frustration at the prospect of another six months of uncertainty over Brexit. As of 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark STOXX 600 was at 385.12, down 1.56 points or 0.4%. The FTSE 100 was down 0.5%, while the German DAX was down 0.4%. The Paris CAC 40 was outperforming, down less than 0.1%, thanks mainly to its luxury names.
As has often been the case, LVMH’s performance is supporting the rest of the sector. Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and scarf-maker Hermes (PA:HRMS) were close behind it at the top of the CAC 40, while Italian rivals Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and Moncler (MI:MONC) were also both among the best performers in Milan.
The results have distracted attention away from one less pleasant piece of news that may come back to haunt the sector in due course. French police raided the premises of some of the country’s drinks makers on Wednesday on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), a drinks maker that doesn’t have the same exposure to fashion as the other stocks in the sector, is the notable laggard this morning, rising only 0.3%."

American Media Inc (AMI) said in a statement it is looking at ""strategic options"" for the weekly, as well as for the Globe and the National Examiner brands.
""We feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership,"" the company said in a statement. An AMI spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. 
Last year, AMI cooperated with federal prosecutors to avoid charges and admitted it made a $150,000 hush-money payment to a former Playboy magazine model to prevent her from going public ahead of the 2016 election with claims that she had an affair with Trump.
The incident involved a practice called ""catch and kill"" in which the tabloid bought rights to a story but never published the potentially damaging information. David Pecker, chief executive of American Media, has been a longtime Trump ally and has described the president as a ""personal friend."" 
Trump and his lawyers have argued the payments were a personal matter unrelated to the election.
More recently, the National Enquirer has been embroiled in a battle with Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and also the owner of the Washington Post. 
The world's richest man, who has frequently been a target of ire from Trump, has accused the publication of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing intimate photos. 
AMI has defended its reporting on Bezos' affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor.
Earlier in April, Jeff Bezos reached a divorce settlement with his wife MacKenzie that made her the world's third-richest woman while allowing him to retain voting control of his entire stake in Amazon.

Over its 92-year history, the National Enquirer has enticed readers in supermarket checkout lines with sensational headlines and photos about celebrities. The tabloid's website claims it reaches an audience of 5 million.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>",Factbox: Four measures to watch for in Uber's IPO filing,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc's initial public offering (IPO) filing on Thursday will draw inevitable comparisons to its smaller ride-hailing rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which completed its initial public listing last month.
Following Lyft's poor stock market performance of late, investors will be scrutinizing Uber's financial results and projections closely.
Not only is Uber much larger than Lyft, but it is also more complex, with operations that go beyond its core ride-hailing business and extend into areas such as food delivery and freight transit. 
The following are four key financial metrics which investors will be watching for: 
REVENUE
Uber is a much larger company than Lyft, with operations in markets ranging from the United States to Latin America to North Africa. Lyft operates entirely in North America.
Uber also has a broader array of business lines, including a food delivery service and a platform for commercial freight. 
As a result, Uber clocks much higher revenues than Lyft. Uber reported net revenues of $11.4 billion in 2018. That is in comparison to $2.2 billion for Lyft during the same year. 
If one considers revenue growth, however, Uber may take a back seat to Lyft. Lyft has been rapidly gaining market share relative to its larger rival, meaning that its revenue growth has been outpacing Uber's. 
Lyft's revenue more than doubled between 2017 and 2018, from just over $1 billion to more than $2.1 billion. Uber's, meanwhile, grew 43 percent, to $11.4 billion. 
ADJUSTED EBITDA
This common measure of profitability will look similar to Lyft's in one major respect: both Uber and Lyft are loss-making companies. 
Uber reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.8 billion in 2018, compared to around $950 million for Lyft. 
But expect Uber to argue to investors that its scale will give it a significant advantage in terms of profitability over the long run, allowing it to more effectively hold down costs. 
It will also likely point out that its year-over-year losses are down, from $2.2 billion in 2017. Lyft's ticked up over the same timeframe. 
CONTRIBUTION MARGIN
This lesser-known financial metric will likely play a big role in Uber's pitch to investors. It is designed to show whether Uber's operations in individual markets are profitable on a standalone basis by ignoring company-wide costs like marketing or technology investment. 
Expect Uber to make a case that positive contribution margins in many of its markets mean that, fundamentally, its business model works. 
Uber has a different method of calculating contribution margin than Lyft, so the two companies' figures cannot be directly compared, a person familiar with the matter said.
MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS

Uber generates more rides than Lyft in large part due to its wider, global presence. Lyft had 18.6 million monthly active riders as of the fourth quarter of 2018.

Don’t get us wrong, Tencent has been a great story thus far. The stock with the single biggest weighting in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up about 25 percent already this year and briefly topped the HK$400 ($51) level for the first time since June 2018 today after one of its games won regulatory approval in China, according to a statement on the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television’s website.
But beyond Internet giant Tencent and the usual suspects in chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., there are other names posting even bigger gains.
Let’s start in Japan, where Softbank Group Corp. and Rakuten Inc. are up around the 50 percent mark each this year, among the biggest gainers in the Nikkei 225 Index. Both have gotten a lift amid the battle of the ride-share public offerings. Rakuten owns an 11.5 percent stake in  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., while Softbank awaits the pending IPO of rival Uber Technologies Inc. following its deal in late 2017 to acquire a sizable stake in the popular ride service company.
Rakuten’s share price has been volatile since Lyft’s less-than-stellar trading debut at the end of March, with the new stock tumbled 17 percent in just over two weeks. The firm said April 1 it would book a valuation gain of 110 billion yen in the first quarter after an evaluation of Lyft shares following its IPO.
As for Softbank, it stands to profit handsomely with Uber seeking to raise $10 billion in its IPO, kicking off a road show to market shares this month and begin trading publicly in May, according to people familiar with the matter.
Over in Australia, payment services provider Afterpay Touch Group Ltd. is the top-performing stock in the benchmark stock index, with shares more than doubling this year to hit a record high Thursday. The company is a big part of the emergent WAAAX group of tech stocks (because everyone loves tech acronyms) leading a fresh wave of gains Down Under -- WiseTech Global Ltd., Appen Ltd., Altium Ltd. and Xero Ltd.
The group has surged some 230 percent since June 2017, outperforming FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) groups in the U.S. and Asia in that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Over in Hong Kong, Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. is the second-best performer in the Hang Seng Index this year, up about 48 percent to rebound from its first annual loss since 2011 last year.
The lens maker will see sales maintain strong growth of more than 20 percent in the next 12 months, supported by demand for its multiple-lens high-resolution handset camera from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp., according to Charles Shum, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. However, operating margins will struggle to inch higher given it’ll be difficult to boost the selling price amid greater competition, he said.

The Shenzhen-based company has discussed with potential advisers a share sale that could raise as much as $1 billion, one of the people said. The offering could happen next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.
Vanke would join other Chinese developers such as Country Garden Holdings Co. in spinning off their management units, which are less prone to government policy changes and economic cycles. Country Garden Services Holdings Co. was listed by introduction last year, while China Aoyuan Group Ltd.’s services arm raised $94 million in a Hong Kong initial public offering last month.
Deliberations are at early stage, and details including the fundraising size and timeline could change, according to the people. A representative for China Vanke didn’t respond to requests for comment, while a representative for the property management unit said they have no current plans for a listing.
Property management and related services were China Vanke’s second-largest revenue generator after property sale. The business contributed 9.8 billion yuan ($1.5 billion), equivalent to about 3.3 percent of the developer’s total revenue last year, according to its annual report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - California utility owner PG&E Corp is exploring expanding its board as it navigates bankruptcy proceedings in an effort to potentially settle an ongoing battle with shareholder BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The discussions between PG&E and BlueMountain representatives underscore the restructuring challenges the company faces since filing for bankruptcy in January to address potentially crushing liabilities from catastrophic wildfires. 
The talks come days after PG&E named a new chief executive and unveiled plans to appoint 10 directors to a newly formed board in response to pressure from other shareholders. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the slate as dominated by hedge-fund financiers, out-of-state executives and others lacking experience operating utilities.
The discussions are in early stages and will not necessarily lead to a deal that would again revamp PG&E's board, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. A PG&E representative declined to comment. 
BlueMountain, a New York-based hedge fund, in March selected 13 candidates for PG&E's board after slamming the company for seeking bankruptcy protection. BlueMountain's slate includes an expert in resolving victim claims, a former treasurer of the state of California, a prominent California-based hedge fund manager, and people with banking and energy industry expertise.
Sources familiar with the talks have said that the company has been impressed with the skill-set the BlueMountain nominees bring in three main areas: doing business in California, safety and risk management, and utility and clean energy operations.

BlueMountain owns roughly 8 million PG&E shares, far less than the amount held by a group that includes Knighthead Capital Management, Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management. This group pushed for PG&E to hire Bill Johnson, who has been chief executive of the Tennessee Valley Authority, as its new leader.

1079,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 10:34PM ET</span>","Asian Equities Fall; Trade Talks, China Data and Brexit in Focus","Investing.com - Asian equities fell in morning trade on Thursday as traders digested the latest news on the Sino-U.S. trade front and Brexit.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.7% and 1.4% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.8%.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that China’s producer price index in March rose 0.4% from a year earlier, in line with expectations.
The consumer price index increased 2.3% from a year earlier, the NBS said, just lower than the 2.4% rise predicted by economists.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.1%, while South Korea’s KOSPI was unchanged at 2,224.04.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was down 0.5%.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, investors cheered news of progress on one of the key sticking points in trade talks.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview that the two sides have made progress on a trade deal, and that they have agreed on “an enforcement mechanism” to police any agreement they reach.
“We’ve agreed that both sides will establish enforcement offices that will deal with the ongoing matters,” Mnuchin said, adding that the meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Tuesday was “productive.”
“We went into late last night, and we have another call scheduled for tomorrow morning ... we still have some important issues to address, but both sides are working very hard on this agreement,” Mnuchin said.
Meanwhile, European Union leaders and the U.K. agreed to a “flexible extension ” of the Brexit deadline till Oct. 31, which Prime Minister Theresa May has accepted.
In a press conference after the agreement was reached, May said “the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear”. She acknowledged the “huge frustration” that the UK had not yet left the EU.
In other news, the U.S. Federal Reserve released the minutes from its March 19-20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which voted not to hike its benchmark rate at the March 19-20 gathering.
However, Fed officials left the door open for more rate hikes by saying some policymakers under certain circumstances could “judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year.”
“Several participants noted that their views of the appropriate range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction,” the minutes say.
But the summary also says: “A majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year.”"
1080,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 10:30PM ET</span>",U.S.-China trade war is rerouting U.S. import flows: report,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's trade war with China has U.S. companies shifting purchases of tariff-targeted products like furniture, refrigerators and car tires to countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to a new analysis released on Wednesday.
Trump's decision to slap tariffs of 10 to 25 percent on about $250 billion of Chinese goods has roiled U.S. retailers and manufacturers, who are scrambling to avoid potentially crippling cost increases.
Overall U.S. imports of containerized freight from China fell 6.4 percent during the first quarter as buyers worked off product stockpiled ahead of tariff increases and rerouted orders to lower-cost countries, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva said in the report.
U.S. imports of Chinese-made furniture by retailers such as IKEA,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD),  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Room to Go fell 13.5 percent in the first quarter. That was partly offset by a 37.2 percent rise in shipments from Vietnam and a 19.3 percent increase in imports from Taiwan, Panjiva said.
The change also affected home appliances. 
Imports of Chinese refrigerators fell 24.1 percent during the quarter, when shipments from South Korea and Mexico jumped 31.8 percent and 32 percent, respectively. 
""A major factor in that shift has been a rearrangement in supply chains by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics,"" Panjiva said in the report.
The auto industry has also been rethinking trade routes.
Tire imports from China slumped 28.6 percent during the first three months of the year. At the same time, U.S. sea ports saw a 141.7 surge in product from Vietnam and an 11.1 percent increase in tire shipments from South Korea. Hankook Tire and Nexen are among the suppliers picking up the new business, Panjiva said.
U.S. companies are also shifting factory investments in the wake of the China trade tiff, which a trio of economists estimate has already cost U.S. consumers and companies $19.2 billion.
Ohio-based Cooper Tire & Rubber Co in December said it formed a joint venture with Sailun Vietnam Co Ltd. to build a truck and bus radial tire factory near Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City. 

""We are excited about this addition to our manufacturing footprint, which diversifies our sourcing to protect against risk, including tariffs,"" Cooper Chief Financial Officer Christopher Eperjesy said in February, when the company announced a $34 million write-down on the value of a joint venture manufacturing project in China.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 09:09PM ET</span>",Deutsche Boerse says it is in talks to buy some Refinitiv FX units,"By David French, Andreas Framke and Arno Schuetze
NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG said on Wednesday that it is in “concrete negotiations” with data provider Refinitiv about the potential acquisition of certain foreign exchange business units.
The statement came after Reuters reported that Deutsche Boerse was in talks to buy FXall, a foreign exchange electronic trading platform owned by Refinitiv, for about $3.5 billion, citing people familiar with the matter.
“The negotiations and assessments of a potential transaction are ongoing,” Deutsche Boerse said in a statement.
However, it said that ""the purchase price of $3.5 billion and the imminent signing of binding contracts mentioned in the market speculations are entirely unfounded."" 
Should a deal be consummated, it would further diversify Deutsche Boerse's business beyond stock trading, while enabling Refinitiv to trim its debt pile following its acquisition last year by a consortium led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP in a $20-billion leveraged buyout.
Refinitiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
FXall has more than 2,300 institutional clients that are trading foreign exchange on its platform, offering more than 500 different currency pairs through methods including on-the-spot trading, forward and option contracts, according to its website.
Deutsche Boerse, operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has been seeking new avenues for growth, as the profitability of facilitating trades is eroded by new digital rivals and the rise of passive investment funds that track indices.
On Tuesday, Deutsche Boerse announced it would buy risk management software provider Axioma for $850 million, with plans to merge it with its existing index business to create a new analytics firm.
Deutsche Boerse's global head of FX, Carlo Koelzer, was quoted by the Handelsblatt business daily on April 1 saying that the firm would be interested in buying FXall, should it ever come up for sale.
Blackstone acquired a 55 percent stake in Refinitiv last year from information provider Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent of Reuters News. 

Thomson Reuters retains a 45 percent stake in Refinitiv, which provides financial information, security pricing, analytics, risk management and compliance support tools. Refinitiv took on $13.5 billion in debt as part of its leveraged buyout, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 06:16PM ET</span>",U.S. looking 'very closely' at Qatar-Air Italy deal: Pompeo,"By Patricia Zengerle and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is scrutinizing state-owned Qatar Airways' acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Air Italy, which has been flying to U.S. destinations since June in a move seen by U.S. lawmakers as flouting a deal not to add new flights to the domestic market. 
Questioned repeatedly about the acquisition during a U.S. Senate hearing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, ""We're looking very closely at this recent decision by Qatar to take on 49 percent of this airline.""
Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier violated an agreement Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.
""There are lots of consultations taking place,"" Pompeo said. In January, U.S. and Qatari officials met to discuss civil aviation matters, the State Department said earlier this year.
Since 2015 the largest U.S carriers - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines Group and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition.
Gulf airlines have always denied those accusations and last year the three major Middle Eastern carriers reached a voluntary agreement, saying they would not add new flights to the United States.
However, Air Italy has been flying to New York and Miami since June last year and was due to start serving San Francisco and Los Angeles from this month and Chicago in May.
Qatar Airways acquired 49 percent of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced non-stop U.S. destinations from Milan.
Scott Reed, campaign manager for the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a group representing the three largest U.S. airlines and aviation unions, said ""the future of this industry – and the jobs it supports – depend on the Trump administration holding Qatar accountable for its trade-cheating actions.""
In December, 11 Republican senators wrote a letter to Pompeo suggesting the flights from Milan ""were consistent with Qatar Airways pattern of adding subsidized capacity in markets where demand is already well served.""
Reed said ""there is bipartisan concern that Qatar Airways is violating last year’s agreement with the United States - making its finances more opaque instead of less and using Air Italy as a proxy to undermine the U.S. airline industry.""
An aide to Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, noted that January marked the one-year anniversary of agreements between the United States and Qatar on government subsidies to Qatar Airways. 

In a side letter to the agreements, the Qatari government indicated there was no intention to launch additional flights from Qatar to U.S. destinations but said some passengers would board flights in Europe before flying to U.S. destinations.

In ride-hailing company Lyft's ninth day of trading its shares clocked their lowest closing price since going public on March 29. And the $60.12 close was 16.5 percent below Lyft's final IPO price of $72 and even under the low end of its initial price target range of $62 to $68.
Reuters reported late Tuesday that rival Uber would seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock in an IPO, and file the offering with regulators as soon as Thursday. Uber declined to comment for the report which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
""It's not a coincidence that the day before Uber was expected to make a filing that investors are immediately contrasting it to Lyft and Lyft looks less attractive,"" said Matt Moscardi, analyst at MSCI in Boston.
For example, heavy betting by short sellers against Lyft may be leaving investors anxious about Lyft's valuation, Moscardi said.
It could also work in Uber's favor that it is now expected to seek a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion, below the $120 billion investment bankers previously told the company it could be worth, according to the Reuters report. 
Uber may also have better name recognition, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""It could be that people are anticipating the Uber IPO. When you go somewhere do you Lyft? Uber has become a verb.""

After the close of trading on Wednesday, Lyft announced that it would release financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31 after the market closes on May 7.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",JetBlue targets low-fare transatlantic travel with 2021 London launch,"By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp hopes to break into the low-fare, transatlantic travel market beginning in 2021 with multiple daily flights from New York and Boston to London, its first European destination, the carrier said on Wednesday. 
To service the routes, the sixth largest U.S. carrier will convert 13 Airbus A321LR aircraft from its existing order book with a fresh version of its Mint business product.
The idea is to offer customers a fresh choice on routes where JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty said current competitor fares ""are enough to make you blush."" 
New York-based JetBlue, which unveiled the long-awaited launch at an employee event at John F. Kennedy International Airport, said it is still evaluating which London airports it will serve.
The company, which has built a reputation in the United States for more coach legroom than competitors and free broadband internet, has argued for regulators to force slot divestitures at high-traffic airports like London's Heathrow to create a level playing field for new entrants.
A handful of Europe-based budget carriers have tried to penetrate the transatlantic market in recent years, but only cash-strapped Norwegian Air is still standing.
Iceland's WOW, PrimeraAir Nordic, Britain's Flybmi and Monarch Airlines and Cypriot carrier Cobalt have all ceased operations in a sector grappling with over-capacity and high fuel costs.
JetBlue said it will raise the bar on what travelers can expect from a low-cost carrier, particularly in Europe.
The carrier has argued in the past that its version of business class, Mint, has driven a 50 percent decline in premium fares on some competing U.S. routes, a reduction it believes it can also deliver for premium travel between the United States and Europe.
""JetBlue's Mint product suits the Atlantic market as they will likely come in with stimulative fares to drive customer awareness and loyalty,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a recent note to clients.

The main issue will be whether JetBlue is able to gain access at major international airports, she said, like London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology stocks led Wall Street slightly higher on Wednesday, as U.S. inflation data proved to be benign and the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting were unsurprising. 
The blue-chip Dow, held back by industrial stocks, squeaked into positive territory at the closing bell.
The three major U.S. indexes were relatively unchanged following the release of the Fed's minutes, which reaffirmed the central bank's patience regarding future interest rate hikes.

Core U.S. consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy segments, rose at the slowest annual pace in over a year, according to the Labor Department's CPI report. The tepid inflation data further supported the Fed's decision to suspend its three-year, interest-rate-hike campaign.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 03:02PM ET</span>",Wife of ousted Nissan boss Ghosn returns to Japan to testify,"TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - The wife of ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn returned to Japan on Wednesday and intends to testify to Tokyo prosecutors, a source close to her entourage said, days after she left the country to seek help from the French government.
The source, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said Carole Ghosn would be questioned by authorities as soon as Thursday, confirming a report by the Nikkei newspaper earlier on Wednesday.
Prosecutors last week arrested the former Nissan chairman for the fourth time on suspicion he tried to enrich himself at the cost of $5 million to the automaker. 
Authorities had also wanted to question his wife on suspicion that Ghosn had siphoned off payments through a company where his wife is an executive to purchase a yacht and a boat, public broadcaster NHK has reported.
Ghosn has said he is innocent of all the charges against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
His wife left Japan last week after Ghosn's arrest, telling the Financial Times she was going to seek help for her spouse, a French citizen. Paris has said it was monitoring the situation.
Prosecutors had earlier seized her Lebanese passport but overlooked her U.S. one, allowing her to leave Japan, the Financial Times said.
The Nikkei reported on Wednesday that she had arrived back in Japan at Tokyo's Haneda airport, with the intention of testifying to prosecutors on Thursday, citing sources. The newspaper quoted her as saying she wanted to tell a court that there was ""absolutely nothing illegal"". 
A spokesman for Ghosn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NHK said last week that prosecutors asked her to meet them for voluntary questioning as an unsworn witness, but the request was turned down, which prompted them to ask judges to question her on their behalf.

Such a request gives judges the power to question on a mandatory basis witnesses who refuse to testify, according to NHK.

1102,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Newmont Bondholder Revolt May Put Barrick on Hook for Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold Corp. could find itself partially liable for $600 million in additional debt if some  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM). bondholders have their way.
The creditors are trying to block an amendment Newmont is seeking for a large tranche of notes associated with its operations in Nevada, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The change would prevent liability for those bonds from shifting to Barrick after the companies’ recently announced joint venture in the state is completed.
A majority of holders of Newmont’s $600 million of bonds due 2035 have organized and submitted their rejection to the proposed change, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The JV with Barrick is not contingent upon Newmont bondholders agreeing to the amendment, Newmont said in a statement last week. But if bondholders succeed, the JV would likely be the new guarantor of the securities, according to CreditSights analysts, putting Barrick on the hook to assume some of the liability.
The 2035 bonds are guaranteed by Newmont USA Ltd., which includes the three Nevada gold mines set to become part of the JV with Barrick. Those assets accounted for about 88 percent of the guarantor’s proven and probable reserves within North America at the end of last year, and the proposed JV would constitute a sale of “all or substantially all” of the guarantor’s assets in Nevada, per the bond prospectus.
That would make the JV liable for the 2035 notes, which isn’t necessarily what Barrick signed up for when announcing the deal last month. It’s not clear whether Barrick asked for the changes.
The relationship between Newmont and Barrick, the world’s two largest gold miners, has been fraught for years. Merger talks between the two companies have failed in the past, as have attempts to increase cooperation in Nevada. The joint venture agreement was only reached after Barrick launched, and agreed to withdraw, a hostile bid for Newmont.
Consent Fee
Newmont is required to bring its assets into the joint venture free and clear of any third party debt, and Barrick is not planning to guarantee any Newmont obligations, nor is the joint venture, a spokeswoman for Barrick said. “Barrick expects that Newmont will address any joint venture related issues that it may have with its creditors in a manner that would accommodate the completion of the joint venture arrangements within the time frame contemplated by the parties.”
Newmont couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
Newmont has offered holders $1 per every $1,000 to accept the changes, and consents are due by 5 p.m. New York time Wednesday. The company informed holders of the offer through a statement issued on April 4 at 4:05 p.m., giving them less than a week to respond.
“The guarantor language in the merger covenant is worth more than 10 basis points in our view and we believe bondholders should push for a higher consent fee,” CreditSights analysts Wen Li and Will Benedict said in an April 7 report.
The expiration date comes on the same day that Credit Roundtable, a bondholder industry advocacy group, gathers for its semiannual meeting in Washington. The meeting started at 8:30 a.m. and Newmont had come up in conversation within minutes, according to David Knutson, co-leader of the group.
“Bottom line -- this consent was launched in a way that obscured the potential impact to certain bondholders,” Knutson said.
Last month Newmont was forced to promise shareholders the largest dividend in 32 years to woo support for its $10 billion merger with Goldcorp Inc.
Major equity investors, including Paulson & Co. and VanEck, had argued that the price tag did not reflect the value of Newmont’s joint venture with Barrick, which was negotiated after the Goldcorp deal was struck. The dividend could induce Newmont shareholders to vote for the Goldcorp deal on April 11 by rewarding them in advance for $4.7 billion in synergies that Barrick expects the JV will create.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Investors stage largest two-week retreat from U.S. stocks since July,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled nearly net $7.5 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, capping the largest two-week retreat from the domestic stock market since July 2018, according to data released on Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The move away from the U.S. stock market came as the benchmark S&P 500 index finished its strongest first quarter of the year since 1998, according to Refinitiv data. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up nearly 15.5% thanks to a combination of optimism for a trade breakthrough between the United States and China and the Federal Reserve's decision to pause its series of interest rate hikes. 
Despite that rally, investors have pulled a net of approximately $17.6 billion in assets out of U.S. stock funds over the 13 full weeks of this year, according to ICI data. 
World stock funds, meanwhile, lost a net $31 million in assets, continuing a seven-week pullback on the part of investors. For the year to date, world stock funds have garnered approximately $4.2 billion in net inflows. 
Bond funds brought in about net $11.3 billion last week, continuing a streak of positive inflows that has lasted over each full week of the year. 
The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in millions of dollars):

1104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",A Stupid Question About Stocks Yields a Surprising Answer,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- University of Miami economics professor Alex Horenstein asked a stupid question, and got a surprising answer. He wanted to know how the capital asset pricing model affected stock returns. At first blush, that sounds sensible. Academics have always thought about how their research might affect markets.
One of the earliest and strongest patterns turned up by researchers was how small-capitalization stocks have better risk-adjusted returns than large-capitalization stocks. Once that was published, you might have expected investors to sell large cap stocks and buy small cap stocks, pushing down large cap prices and increasing their future returns while pushing up small cap stock prices and reducing their future returns, until the two had equivalent expected returns.
That didn't happen for small cap stocks, nor for other similar findings. It's true that many patterns turned up by academic researchers proved ephemeral or temporary, but in no case did publication seem to play a role in their demises. It's also true that products are launched to exploit these anomalies, but they don't seem to eliminate – or even attenuate – them. Moreover, a handful of patterns, such as size, value, momentum, quality and others have been found in nearly every financial market studied and have persisted as far back as we can get data.
But the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, is not like those patterns. It claims that all stocks are fairly priced. It doesn't matter which stocks you buy, as long as you buy enough to get a diversified portfolio set to the risk level you choose. It's stupid to ask if it affects stock choices, because it says those choices don't matter. If theories that clearly help investors get ignored, why would theories that give no stock selection advice affect decisions?
Shockingly, Horenstein found that after publication of CAPM – but not before – stocks with low alpha over a five-year period did significantly better over the following year than stocks with high alpha over the same five-year period. Moreover, when academic consensus moved in the early 1990s from single- to multi-factor CAPM, multi-factor alpha replaced single-factor alpha in that pattern.
Alpha is the CAPM measure of risk-adjusted performance. For example, over the last year the S&P 500 is up about 7 percent and low-risk investments about 2 percent. CAPM predicts that stocks should return about 2 percent (the low-risk return) plus their betas times 5 percent (the market return minus the low-risk return). Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) with a 0.4 beta should have returned 4 percent, while Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) with a 1.8 beta should have returned 11 percent. Coca-Cola actually returned 6 percent for an alpha of positive 2 percent, while Celgene returned 9 percent for an alpha of negative 2 percent. Celgene did better but Coca-Cola had better risk-adjusted performance. Horenstein discovered that stocks like Celgene seem to be better future investments than stocks like Coca-Cola - but only since 1964.
This means Horenstein has a new factor, which he calls “betting against alpha.” Investors should be cautious about exploiting it. Hundreds of new factors are proposed every year, and almost all turn out either not to work in the future or are subsumed by better-documented factors. Horenstein has done solid research to support his innovation but the odds are against it entering the pantheon of consensus factors.
The best factors have been documented by hundreds of researchers in many financial markets and eras and proven in decades of application. Betting against alpha correlates with accepted factors like long-term reversal (0.53), value (0.43) and conservative (0.32). Horenstein documents excess performance after adjusting for these factors, but given the high correlations, it may turn out that his analysis leads to improvements in the measurement of other factors rather than adding a new factor.
Many investors did take to heart the lessons from the body of work that includes CAPM was well as modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). They increased diversification, cut the fees they were willing to pay, benchmarked their advisers and moved to more passive and index investments.
But lots of investors apparently learned the math, but not the economics. They switched from chasing stocks that had gone up in the past to chasing stocks that improved risk-return ratios of diversified portfolios—i.e stocks with positive alpha in the past. This doesn't require CAPM specifically, because any reasonable way of evaluating risk-adjusted return could explain Horenstein's results. The key is investors accept MPT—investments should be evaluated by their effect on portfolio statistical properties rather than non-statistical or investment-specific criteria—and most importantly, that they believe past performance is indicative of future results.
After six decades of fruitless searching for evidence that investors exploit useful academic knowledge to pick stocks, someone has demonstrated that investors pick stocks using academic research that stock picking is useless. Horenstein calls it an “unintended impact,” but that's an understatement. Long before there was CAPM, EMH or MPT, we knew that chasing past results is a bad strategy in investing, gambling and life. MPT appears to have redirected the direction of the chase, but it hasn't taught it investors not to chase."
1105,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>","StockBeat - Conagra Feeds Investor Appetite, Reaffirming Outlook; Shares Rally","Investing.com - ConAgra soared on Wednesday after the food company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and said maintaining its dividend is a ""top priority.""
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG), maker of food brands including Birds Eye, Reddi-wip and Slim Jim, maintained its guidance for earnings of between $2.03 and $2.08 per share and a net sales gain of 1%, sending its share price up 6.2%.
Like most food companies, ConAgra is grappling with rising ingredient costs, and its efforts to pass them on to shoppers have been thwarted by intense competition.
Most of the ConAgra's sales growth has been driven by acquisitions, so the company has focused squeezing out that little bit of extra growth by addressing executional challenges at some of its acquired businesses.
And its efforts are seemingly starting to take shape as the food company on Wednesday increased its value capture from synergies estimate to $285 million from $215 million.
Beyond the impact of rising costs, the integration of Pinnacle Foods, acquired in 2018, has weighed on overall gross margins, strangling cash flows, adding to worries that ConAgra's dividend of 85.2 cents a share is vulnerable to a cut.
But the food company vowed to slash debt as it seeks maintain its current dividend, which it said was a ""top priority.""
The shares are up more than 37% this year but are still off 25% from their 52-week high reached on June 21. "
1106,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 01:18PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers grill bank CEOs for the first time since financial crisis,"By Imani Moise and Elizabeth Dilts
(Reuters) - Chief executives of some of the largest U.S. banks appeared before Congress on Wednesday, giving lawmakers their first opportunity to grill the lenders since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Democratic lawmakers focused many of their questions on who the banks were doing business with, probing for answers about their Russian accounts and financing of gun manufacturers.
The tone, questions and players were distinctly different from a decade ago, when lawmakers focused on banks' ability to safeguard the financial system and avoid future bailouts. Among the CEOs on the panel, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Jamie Dimon was the only one who headed his bank before the financial crisis. 
Still, bank executives got a few chances to flag hoped-for talking points like their positive contribution to the economy when Republican lawmakers quizzed them on more systemic issues.
Along with JPMorgan's Dimon, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's Brian Moynihan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's Mike Corbat,  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) Inc's David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman all faced off against the House Financial Services Committee.
Ronald O’Hanley, CEO of  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT), and Charles Scharf, CEO of Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, the country's two largest custody banks, also appeared. 
The hearing was led by Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and staffed with some high-profile freshman representatives like progressives including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 
Waters' first question, directed at three of the bank CEOs, was whether they had found suspicious activity within their banks related to Russian accounts. 
Citi's Corbat declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the matter. The Bank of America and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) CEOs said they had conducted internal investigations and did not find any suspicious activity. 
Questions largely focused less on systemic risks and more on social issues like how banks are addressing wealth inequality by adjusting overdraft fees in checking accounts, and whether banks are extending loans to businesses that need them.
Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney pressed JPMorgan's Dimon to commit to a policy that would reduce the bank's financing of gun makers. Citi and Bank of America last year said they would no longer provide certain banking services to gun manufacturers.
Some Republican lawmakers criticized such policies on Wednesday, with Representative Bill Posey cautioning banks against withholding financing from legal business and Representative Sean Duffy accusing Bank of America of denying Americans their Second Amendment rights.
The bank executives' prepared remarks focused on arguing that Wall Street has reformed the practices that fueled the crisis and stressing the contribution banks make to the broader economy.
Dimon said that JPMorgan ""will never lose sight of what we learned."" Still, the bank has taken steps that went a long way to preventing another crisis, Dimon argued. 
Since the crisis, the country's largest banks have added more than $800 billion in capital to bolster the financial system. 
In the months leading up to the hearing, the banks also made a string of announcements to show how they are helping customers and communities. 
Bank of America said on Tuesday it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $20 from $15 by 2021.
Last month, JPMorgan said it would no longer finance the private prison industry and would invest $350 million in job training programs.
Goldman Sachs has publicly set targets for hiring women and minority groups, a move Citigroup also made late last year.

 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co was not present at the hearing since former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly last month, two weeks after appearing before the same committee.

Chao also said the FAA will ""thoroughly review"" Boeing's (N:BA) final software upgrade package and training revisions once the airplane manufacturer submits it. ""The department's goal is to ensure public trust in aviation safety and preserve the preeminence of the United States as the gold standard in aviation safety,"" Chao told a U.S. House panel.
She said the FAA's decision to ground the plane was ""fact based"" and came after new satellite data and wreckage was examined.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department inspector general’s office and a blue-ribbon panel to be named by Chao are also reviewing the plane’s certification.
Last week, the FAA said it was establishing a Joint Authorities Technical Review ""to ensure the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX"" and scrutinize anti-stall software that has been questioned.
The review chaired by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart is comprised of a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities. Reuters reported Tuesday that China, Indonesia, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, Brazil and others are taking part in the review, expected to last about three months.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after the two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people. 
American Airlines and United Airlines this week extended flight cancellations due to the 737 MAX grounding until early June.

The FAA has for decades delegated some certification duties to Boeing and other manufacturers.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) on Wednesday lifted its 2019 revenue forecast after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits, boosted by robust travel demand and a renewed agreement with credit-card issuer  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP). 
The No. 2 U.S. carrier said it is targeting full-year revenue growth of 5 to 7 percent, an increase from 4 to 6 percent previously, with the American Express deal expected to add about $500 million to 2019 revenue.
Total operating revenues grew 5.1 percent to $10.47 billion in the first quarter to March 31, as growth in premium ticket sales and the airline's maintenance business helped offset lower cargo volumes.
""Demand for Delta's product has never been stronger,"" President Glen Hauenstein in a statement.
Shares were 0.9-percent higher at $57.46 midday, off a session high of $58.95. 
So far this year, Atlanta-based Delta's stock has outperformed U.S. rivals that own the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, which has the world's largest MAX fleet with 34 jets, has cut its 2019 financial outlook, while American Airlines Group Inc trimmed its first-quarter revenue forecast on Tuesday after cancelling 1,200 flights due to the MAX grounding in the United States.
Delta did not update its own 2019 profit target but executives said on a conference call they were ""cautiously optimistic"" that earnings would come in toward the top-end of guidance.
Chief Executive Ed Bastian declined to comment on whether the carrier was picking up customers from competitors that are cancelling flights due to the MAX suspension. 
Delta expects second-quarter profit in the range of $2.05 per share to $2.35 per share, above the average $2.13 per share analysts had estimated, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The carrier forecast total unit revenue, a closely-watched measurement of revenues per available seat mile, to increase 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the second quarter.
""We think Delta's relatively higher share of business travelers, unit revenue premium to peers and stronger-than-peer cash generation argue for a premium valuation,"" said CFRA analyst Jim Corridore. 
Net income rose to $730 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $557 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Delta earned 96 cents per share, beating expectations of 90 cents per share.

The results relieved investor concerns about the impact of a U.S. government shutdown in January and severe weather during the period.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - One of Bayer's largest shareholders tore into the company's management on Wednesday for underestimating the legal risks of its takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), setting the stage for a fiery annual general meeting after a 30 percent plunge in the shares. 
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) has seen about 30 billion euros ($34 billion) wiped off its market value since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto had not warned of weedkiller Roundup's alleged cancer risks. It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month.
""It's quite drastic when a takeover triggers such value destruction and reputational damage so quickly. There can be no talk of a successful takeover any more,"" Ingo Speich, the head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment, told Reuters. He will be among the shareholders to speak at the April 26 annual general meeting (AGM).
""What's startling is that things have effectively moved beyond management's control because we're now at a point where the decisions over future development are made in court rooms,"" he said, adding Bayer had clearly underestimated the risks. 
With a holding of about 1 percent, Deka says it is Bayer's 10th-largest shareholder overall, and the second-largest German one after DWS.
Major shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis last week recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval at the AGM. Glass Lewis also advised against a vote of approval for the non-executive supervisory board. 
A shareholder vote to ratify boards' actions features prominently at every German AGM. Though largely symbolic, as it has no bearing on management liability, it is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment.
Among shareholders that have vowed to deny top Bayer executives their vote of confidence is the former head of DWS, Christian Strenger. 
Deka's Speich declined to disclose how Deka would vote.
Company filings showed this week that Bayer's supervisory board sought law firm Linklaters' expert opinion for reassurance that the management board had complied with its duties when acquiring Monsanto for $63 billion last year.
The supervisory board in Germany's two-tier corporate board system has to sign off on larger transactions. Bayer's non-executive Chairman Werner Wenning was a driving force of the Monsanto deal, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Bayer is appealing, or has vowed to appeal, the two jury verdicts, but more than 11,000 plaintiffs are seeking damages.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators across the globe have found that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is not likely carcinogenic to humans.
However, the World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
Speich said Bayer could now be vulnerable to attacks from activist shareholders who might seek to break it up, although the ""bitter pill"" of litigation risks might deter them for now. 

Such risks could also distract management, he added, when it ""should be fully absorbed by the integration of Monsanto,"" Speich said.

The report was the company's first since  returning to the public market last month.
Here are the important numbers from Levi's report, compared with the same quarter last year, when the company was still private. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg did not release earnings expectations.
""Growth was broad-based across all three regions and all channels, demonstrating that our strategies are working and our investments are paying off,"" CEO Chip Bergh said in a release, referring to the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
For its 2019 fiscal year, Levi's expects constant-currency net revenue growth in the mid-single digits and adjusted earnings that are ""flat-to-slightly up"" compared with a year ago.
Levi's also sees around $190 million to $200 million in capital expenditures, and nearly 100 new company-operated store openings in fiscal 2019.
Levi's  debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in late March after a an absence of more than three decades from the public market. The San Francisco-based company first went public in 1971, but was taken private in 1985.
At $717 million, Levi's IPO is the third-largest completed debut in the US this year, behind   Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) ($2.34 billion) and and  Tradeweb ($1.24 billion). All three were oversubscribed, meaning investor demand exceeded the number of shares issued. 
Levi's was the second-largest clothing and accessories IPO since at least 2001, according to an IHS Markit analysis. It was also the oldest such company to list on a US exchange since that year.
 In its prospectus, Levi's said it planned to use capital raised from the public offering to expand more aggressively into China, India and Brazil.
The company's public debut back in March comes amid a flurry of other public offerings expected this year.  Uber is expected to file its S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month and  Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) released its S-1 filing last month.
Levi's debuted at $22.22 a share last month, and closed just under  $22 a share on Tuesday afternoon. Its market cap was just under $8.4 billion on Tuesday.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 10:01AM ET</span>",Shell exits Gazprom-led LNG project in Russia,"By Vladimir Soldatkin and Shadia Nasralla
ST PETERSBURG/LONDON, Russia (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) has decided to exit a Baltic liquefied natural gas (LNG) project led by Russian state gas major Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) on the Russian Baltic coast.
The development comes as Western firms struggle to expand in Russia because of pressure from sanctions imposed by the United States, while for Gazprom it could mean limited access to Shell's technology as well as the need to fund the project without the help of the Anglo-Dutch major.
Shell, which has a long history of energy cooperation with Russia, said earlier it was studying the possible implications of a recent decision by Gazprom to move toward the full integration of its Baltic LNG and gas processing plants.
""Following Gazprom's announcement on March 29 regarding the final development concept of Baltic LNG, we have decided to stop our involvement in this project,"" Cederic Cremers, Shell Russia's chairman, said in a statement.
""We have a number of other ongoing projects with Gazprom, including as part of the Strategic Alliance established between the two companies in 2015, which are not impacted by this decision,"" Cremers added.
Gazprom declined to comment.
Shell remains a shareholder in the Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2 plant, which produces LNG on the Russian Pacific island of Sakhalin. Shell has been struggling to increase output of the frozen gas at the project for a number of reasons.
Its decision to leave the Baltic LNG project leaves open a question about the availability of technology needed for this project as Shell will not be providing it.
Shell had developed a technology specifically for the Sakhalin Energy LNG plant, and in February said it had created a 50/50 venture with Gazprom that would use Shell's LNG know-how to develop Russia's own technology for supercooling gas.
KEY TECHNOLOGY 
The venture was expected to effectively insulate Russia from any new U.S. sanctions on LNG, a sector in which key technology belongs to a handful of players - mainly global majors such as Shell, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Total.
Russia, one of the world's biggest oil producers, has been under Western sanctions since 2014 due to its role in the Ukraine crisis.
While the production of seaborne LNG is not directly affected by the sanctions, the sales and marketing of it, as well as foreign participation, have become more complicated due to the restrictions.
Shell previously suspended some shale oil and gas projects due to the introduction of sanctions on Moscow.
On March 29, Gazprom said in a statement that together with its partner RusGazDobycha it had made a decision on the final configuration of the project for a large-scale complex that would process ethane-containing gas and produce LNG in the Leningrad region. That statement did not mention Shell. 

Shell said on Wednesday that its representations and those of Gazprom had not discussed the Baltic LNG project at their meetings in the Hague on Tuesday and Wednesday. These were their regular annual meetings to discuss progress on projects which are part of the strategic alliance, Shell added.

TALLINN (Reuters) - Unacceptable clients remain in the Estonian banking system despite tougher regulation, the country's financial watchdog said on Wednesday, adding that some lenders will be placed under detailed monitoring.
The move by Estonia's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) follows a special review of the country's 16 banks, instigated after 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious payments were last year found to have moved through Danske Bank's small Estonian branch.
""Despite the implementation of know-your-customer measures there are clients who are not acceptable for the Estonian financial system,"" FSA board member Andre Nomm told a news conference.
The money laundering crisis deepened when Swedish lender Swedbank was linked to the scandal in February.
Swedbank is the subject of a joint investigation by the Swedish and Baltic financial watchdogs after media reports said the bank knew about transactions worth up to 20 billion euros a year from high-risk, non-resident clients through its Estonian branch between 2010 and 2016.
Nomm said the risks to Estonian banking from serving non-residents have been substantially reduced and that the majority of the banking was now focused on serving local business and private clients.
However, he said some banks, including Swedbank, had been put on detailed monitoring plans. Nomm declined to name the other banks but said they covered the entire spectrum of the country's banking system.
""We are giving a single and consistent message to the managers of the banks that Estonia is no place for dodgy banking,"" Nomm said in a separate statement. 

Swedbank Chairman Lars Idermark quit last week, only days after the board ousted its chief executive over her handling of the money laundering scandal.

1119,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 09:46AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Drifts Higher Ahead of Fed Minutes,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks drifted higher in early trading on Wall Street, clawing back some of the prior session’s losses as traders evaluated the future path of monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic.
At 9:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT), the Dow Jones gained 26 points, or 0.1%, to 26,176.42 points, the S&P 500 advanced 6 points, or 0.2%, to 2,884.05 points, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 10 points, or 0.1%, to 7,919.13 points.
After the market open, focus shifted to upcoming minutes from the Federal Reserve’s meeting on March 20. At 2:00PM ET (18:00 GMT), investors will get the details from when the central bank switched gears last month, not only saying it no longer expected to increase rates this year but also indicating that it plans to end the reduction of its balance sheet by September.
The minutes will arrive after U.S. inflation figures published ahead of the open that saw the headline consumer price index tick higher to 1.9% on an annualized basis, but the less volatile core CPI unexpectedly slow to 2.0%.
Muted inflation readings have been one of the core reasons the Fed has opted to take its “patient” policy approach, remaining particularly cautious due to concerns about a global slowdown and pending trade issues.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank made no changes to its own monetary policy, maintaining even lower interest rate levels than those in the U.S, as a result of its sluggish economy. The ECB, which surprised markets with its announcement of additional stimulus for banks in the form of low-cost loans, gave no further details of assistance for the financial sector.
Back in the States, big banks were also in the spotlight as their chief executives head to Washington to participate in a scheduled event, “Holding Megabanks Accountable: A Review of Global Systemically Important Banks 10 Years After the Financial Crisis”, with the House Committee of Financial Services.
Their testimony comes as  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) prepare to unofficially kick off the first-quarter earnings season. Both banks report on Friday.
In other company news, airlines capped market attention after positive earnings and guidance from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and speculation that JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) may announce plans to begin transatlantic flights later on Wednesday.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, rose 0.1% to 96.732 by 9:44 AM ET (13:44 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 2.2 basis points to 2.477%.

Ambulances and police were on the scene at the BAE Systems (LON:BAES) shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, northwestern England.
""We have been made aware of an incident at the BAE Systems site in Barrow. The incident is not related to nuclear safety,"" a spokesman for the Office of Nuclear Regulation said.
""We are liaising with BAE Systems’ site security and will continue to monitor the situation,"" the spokesman added.
BAE said the Devonshire Dock Complex at the site had been closed as a precaution.
""Staff, contractors and local residents are being kept informed,"" a BAE spokeswoman said. 
An unidentified source told The Mail, a Barrow-in-Furness-based publication known previously as the North-West Evening Mail, that staff had been evacuated after a warning about a bomb on an Astute-class nuclear attack submarine.
Barrow-in-Furness makes the new generation of four Dreadnought-class ballistic missile submarines that will eventually replace the Vanguard class vessels which form the basis of the United Kingdom's Trident nuclear deterrent.
Dreadnought-class submarines will measure 153 meters long, with a displacement of 17,200 tonnes, and have a PWR3 nuclear reactor. 

BAE Systems, Rolls Royce (LON:RR) and Babcock are the main industrial partners in the 31-billion pound ($41 billion) Dreadnought project.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>","U.S. charges pummel drugmaker Indivior, hurt Reckitt","By Justin George Varghese and Martinne Geller
(Reuters) - Indivior Plc lost three-quarters of its stock market value on Wednesday and former parent Reckitt Benckiser also fell after the U.S. Justice Department accused the British drugmaker of illegally boosting prescriptions for its blockbuster opioid addiction treatment.
An indictment https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1153066/download filed in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia, alleged Indivior made billions of dollars by deceiving doctors and healthcare benefit programs into believing the film version of its Suboxone treatment was safer and less susceptible to abuse than similar drugs.
Shares in the company crashed as much as 80 percent, wiping out 620 million pounds in market value, and touching their lowest since listing in 2014. They were down 74 percent at 27.04 pence at 1230 GMT. 
Shares in Reckitt Benckiser, from which Indivior was spun out, slumped 5 percent to the bottom of London's blue chip FTSE 100 index, erasing many of the gains made in 2019 after three tough years.
Reckitt wasn't charged but the indictment said the illegal marketing began before the spin-off. 
""This indictment is not against RB Group Plc or any other group company and we currently have no additional or new information in respect of this matter, apart from what has been publicly issued by the Department of Justice and Indivior Plc,"" Reckitt responded in a brief statement on Wednesday.
It referred investors back to a previous statement that it was recognizing a provision of $400 million relating to the issue, but that its final cost could be substantially higher. 
TOUGH TIMES
Indivior had prospered as U.S. officials stepped up efforts to combat an opioid epidemic that President Donald Trump has declared a public health emergency. U.S. sales account for 80 percent of last year's $1 billion in revenue. 
Shares, however, had already been hurt by expectations of a slump in Suboxone sales with the arrival of new generic competition this year and the company has struggled to convince analysts and financial investors that it has an adequate replacement. 
The company is scheduled to be arraigned in court on May 6 and plans to plead not guilty at that hearing, according to a spokesman. 
This also comes at a bad time for Reckitt, which was just starting to regain investor confidence after a series of one-off problems including a safety scandal in South Korea, a failed product launch, a cyber attack and a manufacturing glitch. 
Its chief executive Rakesh Kapoor, who oversaw several acquisitions and divestitures with the aim of turning Reckitt into a global consumer healthcare company, will retire this year, even though a major undertaking - splitting Reckitt into two business units - is unfinished.
POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT
In an indictment which charged Indivior and its subsidiary Indivior Inc with conspiracy, health care fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud, the government said it would seek to have it forfeit at least $3 billion.
""An adverse verdict may have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial position and outlook,"" Indivior said.
The potential penalty is triple last year's annual revenue. The company had net cash of $681 million at the end of the year. 
Indivior said in a statement it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the department's decision to charge it, and added it would vigorously contest it.
""The headline potential penalties are severe but a settlement is also still possible,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. 
Indivior has spent the last two years fighting multiple legal battles and patent disputes in the United States with companies including Dr.Reddy's, Teva and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) to block them from launching generics. 
RECKITT FEARS
Reckitt spun off its pharmaceuticals business into Indivior in 2014, as the shrinking unit battled competition from cheaper generic rivals.
The spin-off, and the 2017 sale of Reckitt's food unit, let Reckitt focus on expanding its consumer health business, which targets ageing populations and those interested in health and wellness in the West and rising incomes in developing markets. 
In addition to concern about Reckitt's direct liability from the charges, investors on Wednesday worried about a possible spillover effect on Reckitt's infant formula business. 
The company had previously flagged implications including ""potential criminal indictment of the group or employees, with reputational impact, distraction and potential debarment which could theoretically extend"" to its infant formula business. 
The business, which sells Enfamil formula, derives a portion of its sales from government contracts in the U.S. supplying a program to support low-income parents. 

However, Reckitt said on Wednesday any risk to the infant formula business was theoretical and seen as ""highly unlikely and only a remote possibility"".

The Financial Times report, citing current and former senior executives, said AT&T had internally discussed selling HBO Europe as part of efforts to reduce a debt pile of $170 billion. 
""We normally do not comment on speculation, but when a news outlet is advised that their reporting is factually incorrect and report it anyway, we feel compelled to set the record straight,"" Stankey, who heads the newly created unit of AT&T, said in a statement. 
""There is no truth whatsoever to the Financial Times' story saying AT&T is or has considered selling HBO Europe. It's completely baseless and inaccurate. HBO Europe is a valuable asset for our growth plans in Europe.""

In November, AT&T said it had committed to cutting its heavy debt load in 2019 through a variety of measures, including a review of all of its non-core assets such as its stake in streaming video company Hulu for possible sale.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Russian investigators call for U.S. investor to be let out of jail,"By Polina Nikolskaya and Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators have asked a court in Moscow to free detained U.S. investor Michael Calvey from custody at a hearing later this week and to place him under house arrest instead, the court said on Wednesday. 
The detention in February of Calvey, founder of the Baring Vostok private equity group, on embezzlement charges which he denies, has rattled some foreign investors and politicians in Russia, who said it had a chilling effect on the business climate. 
Russian courts agree in most cases with prosecutors' recommendations about whether suspects should be detained before trial, so there is a strong possibility Calvey will be allowed out of jail on Thursday. 
The court said in a statement that investigators had submitted documents ahead of court hearings on Thursday in which they asked for Calvey and another detained suspect, Alexey Kordichev, to be put under house arrest. 
That is a U-turn by investigators, who brought the charges against Calvey and his co-accused and had initially asked the court to hold them in detention pending trial. They are in a pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. 
""We also look forward to similar (calls) being made regarding Michael and Alexey's four colleagues,"" Baring Vostok said in a statement welcoming the move by investigators. 
Calvey, who was detained along with several other executives, has said the case is being used to apply pressure on him in a business dispute over a Russian bank in which he is a shareholder.
Moscow's Basmanny district court on Tuesday extended by three months the detention of another suspect in the case, French national Philippe Delpal, at the request of prosecutors. 
A hearing is scheduled for Thursday at the same court to decide on whether Calvey's detention should be extended.
Several prominent Russian businessmen and officials have said that locking Calvey up in pre-trial detention was an unnecessarily tough measure and that his treatment by authorities was too harsh.
""The investment and business communities welcome the call by the Investigative Committee...to ease the restrictive measures against... Michael Calvey,"" Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said. 
Boris Titov, presidential commissioner for entrepreneurs' rights, said last month that he and other business associations were working to try to get Calvey freed on bail.

The Kremlin has said President Vladimir Putin does not plan to intervene in the case and that investigators should be allowed to do their job.

1127,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Exxon Is in Talks Over Floating LNG Partnership in Israel,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is in discussions to build a platform that would expand the export reach of Israel’s biggest natural gas field, according to people familiar with the matter.
The world’s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company is in talks with the firms developing Israel’s Leviathan reservoir to build a floating liquefied natural gas ship, the people said, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. Such a project would allow the Leviathan partners to export to countries not reachable with pipelines and avoid the need to build expensive infrastructure to connect to LNG facilities in Egypt. It’s possible the discussions ultimately won’t lead to a partnership, the people cautioned. 
An Exxon representative said the company was still evaluating its options.
“It’s too early to comment on specific development and production timelines,” the representative said.
Despite considerable gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean region over the past decade, viable export routes have proven tough to find and global energy firms haven’t rushed in. The Leviathan partners have signed deals to meet surging demand in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, but haven’t yet found a way to export to Europe or East Asia.
The partners developing Leviathan, a deep-sea find of about 600 billion cubic meters -- at the time it was found, the biggest underwater gas discovery in a decade -- have bookmarked the next phase of the reservoir’s development for export deals and are examining ways to reach markets outside the region. Delek Drilling LP, the biggest shareholder in the Leviathan field, is looking into several options, such as buying a stake in one of Egypt’s LNG sites.
The talks with Exxon are the latest sign that an unofficial energy boycott on Israel, imposed by leading Arab countries, is fading. Energy majors that partner with big Arab firms have hesitated to do business with Israel in the past, for fear of risking ties with states that control some of the world’s biggest energy reserves and have been hostile toward Israel until now.
Those concerns seem to be dissipating. Israel and Persian Gulf states have found common cause against Iran, leading some Arab leaders, such as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, to break longstanding diplomatic taboos on Israel. Covert trade with the Arab world, mainly involving Israel’s technology sector, also has grown.
For Exxon, expanding into Israel would reflect the company’s growing ambitions in the East Med, an area that straddles Egyptian, Israeli, Lebanese and Cypriot waters. Exxon established a foothold in the region in February, when it found an offshore reservoir in Cypriot waters that’s about one-third the size of Leviathan.
Exxon recently spoke with Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz about participating in an upcoming tender for new offshore drilling blocs, according to people familiar with the matter.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks inched up on Wednesday but were still below the six-month high they reached earlier this week as the prospect of the European Central Bank issuing fresh multi-year loans to banks helped offset concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump threatening more tariffs against the European Union.
The ECB is expected to keep borrowing costs on hold but investors will focus on whether the region's central bank provides some supportive policy when it meets later on Wednesday. The rate decision is due out at 1145 GMT.
A pan-European index of shares was up 0.3 percent, partly reversing Tuesday's losses. Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent, after dropping nearly a full percent on Tuesday. 
Britain's FTSE was little changed ahead of a summit between Prime Minister Theresa and the European Union where a Brexit extension until the end of the year or until March 2020 was looking like the most likely outcome, EU diplomats said.
Trump threatened on Tuesday to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of EU products in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, opening a new front in his global trade war.
Asian stocks fell and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, dropped below the six-month low reached earlier in the week. U.S. stock index futures pointed to firmer open for Wall Street.
Investors will be focused on the U.S. consumer price data for March to be released at 1230 GMT. Inflation rose for the first time in four months in February.
""Risk assets have been threatening to take their foot off the pedal in recent sessions and yesterday we finally saw that with a delayed reaction to the U.S.-EU tariff headlines,"" said Deutsche Bank's chief market strategist Jim Reid. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.1 percent, a day after rising to its highest since Aug. 1.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei lost 0.7 percent.
The ECB is ""going to come out with some more details on the TLTRO,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Prime Partners, referring to cheap loans to banks called targeted long-term refinancing operations. ""The global picture has been set, now we are waiting for the details about what they do and if they are going to speak maybe about the adjustment of the negative interest rate policy on reserves.""
Central banks, including the ECB, have turned dovish this year on worries about slowing growth. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for world economic growth and said a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures. 
Global debt yields held mostly steady, with the 10-year German Bund yield little changed around the zero percent mark. 
In a possible sign of demand for bonds, Saudi Aramco is set to raise $12 billion with its first international bond issue after getting more than $100 billion in orders. It was a record-breaking vote of confidence by investors despite the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October.
Major currencies were little changed before a European Union summit and the ECB meeting.
EU leaders are likely to grant British Prime Minister Theresa May a second delay to Brexit, but they could demand a much longer extension as France pushed for conditions to limit Britain's participation in EU affairs.
The euro held at $1.1274, extending its slow recovery from a four-week low of $1.1183 touched on April 2. The British pound was at $1.3095. The dollar was flat at 111.19 yen, having fallen 0.5 percent so far this week.
Oil prices remained near Tuesday's five-month highs as fighting in Libya raised supply disruption concerns.

U.S. crude futures stood at $64.45 per barrel, up 0.8 percent after rallying to a five-month high of $64.79 on Tuesday. Brent crude futures were at $70.96 per barrel and in reach of Tuesday's five-month peak of $71.34.

Hopes of Modi returning as prime minister after elections that get under way on Thursday have kept foreign investors bullish on India, while the domestic audience rides a wave of patriotism after tensions with arch-rival Pakistan spiked in February. Local markets rose after the tensions eased in March. 
Foreign inflows into Indian equities were a net $6.7 billion in January-March, more than reversing outflows of $4.4 billion in 2018. 
The NSE index has risen about 7 percent this year, and about 63 percent since Modi took office in 2014. 
Recent opinion polls suggest Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) alliance will win a thin parliamentary majority in the elections.
If opinion polls suggest Modi will not return, that ""could cause some nervousness"", said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of India research and a managing director at UBS.
The stock market has rallied without support from earnings. Aggregate data on 399 of India's largest listed companies for which comparable data is available shows earnings have fallen in four of the five years of Modi's tenure, whereas they rose in four out of the five years his predecessor Manmohan Singh was prime minister.
The data, sourced from Refinitiv, also shows that on average, earnings rose 11.94 percent annually under the prior government, while they fell 3.72 percent during Modi's time.

""The underlying earnings trajectory is not even average, it's one of the worst,"" said Chhaochharia.
Big structural changes such as the ban on high currency notes and the launch of a nationwide goods and services tax have hurt growth in the Indian economy, say analysts.
The ratio of corporate profit to gross domestic product (GDP) for companies in the Nifty 500 Index was 2.8 percent in 2018, the lowest in 15 years, according to a report by Motilal Oswal Securities.

MARKETS STILL BULLISH
Modi took office on a wave of optimism he would change India's economic fortunes. Although India has not grown at the anticipated pace, investors remain hopeful his reforms will pay off eventually.
The nearly 75 percent rise in the Nifty 500 index during Modi's tenure also reflects a flight of money from traditional investments such as real estate and gold into shares following his shock 2016 ban on high-value bank notes. 
Still, the performance lags that during each term of Congress-led coalitions, when the Nifty 500 rose nearly 100 percent.

A market rally without an earnings recovery has meant that, based on price-to-earnings ratios, Indian companies are at record high valuations. 
On average, the Nifty 500 index has traded at a P-E ratio of 18 in the past five years, much higher than the 14.22 level during the prior government.

1133,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>","Stocks - U.S. Futures Recover Ahead of CPI, Fed Minutes","Investing.com - Wall Street pointed to a slightly higher open on Wednesday as markets turned their attention to U.S. inflation figures and the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 58 points, or 0.2%, to 26,216.0 points by 6:47 AM ET (10:47 GMT), the S&P 500 futures advanced 8 points, or 0.3%, to 2,890.38 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 18 points, or 0.2%, to 7,611.12 points.
U.S. stocks looked to set to stage a small recovery after growth worries and trade concerns snapped an eight-day winning streak for the S&P 500 when the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth outlook and as President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on $11 billion of European goods.
But research firm Evercore ISI said the IMF may have missed the mark with its gloomy outlook, as both markets and the world economy are showing signs of recovery.
“The IMF lowering its global growth outlook to the lowest since the financial crisis will be viewed in hindsight as a contrarian indicator,” Richard Ross, head of technical analysis at the research firm, wrote in a note. “The technicals suggest that global growth is poised to inflect higher and the backdrop for risk-taking remains strong.”
Separately, economists at Goldman Sachs have lowered the likelihood of a U.S. recession over the next four quarters to slightly over 10% from around 20% at the end of the fourth quarter. They noted that an easing in financial conditions has helped reduce downside risks considerably while the Fed’s pause in hiking interest-rates has lifted sentiment.
Adding further insight into the outlook for monetary policy in the months ahead, the Commerce Department will publish March inflation figures at 8:30AM ET (12:30 GMT). The consumer price index is expected to rise 1.8% on an annualized basis, while core CPI, that excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to hold steady at 2.1%.
At 2:00PM ET (18:00 GMT), investors will peruse the minutes from the Fed’s meeting on March 20. The central bank switched gears last month, not only saying it no longer expected to increase rates this year but also indicated that it plans to end the reduction of its balance sheet by September.
On the company front, big U.S. banks will be in the spotlight as their chief executives head to Washington to participate in a scheduled event, “Holding Megabanks Accountable: A Review of Global Systemically Important Banks 10 Years After the Financial Crisis”, with the House Committee of Financial Services.
Their testimony comes as JP Morgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) prepare to unofficially kick off the first-quarter earnings season. Both banks report on Friday.
Wednesday’s session will also see a trickle of quarterly earnings from the likes of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) ahead of the open and Bed, Bath & Beyond after the close.
Elsewhere, the European Central Bank was set to deliver its latest decision on monetary policy at 7:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT). While no changes to interest rates are expected, the euro zone monetary authority may provide further details to its program to offer low-cost financing to banks, known as TLTROs.
Also on the docket, European leaders are holding an emergency summit starting at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT) to decide whether to grant the U.K. yet another extension to its departure from the European Union.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, dipped 0.06% to 96.55 by 6:49 AM ET (10:49 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury inched up 0.3 basis points to 2.502%.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 06:24AM ET</span>",French official calls on EU watchdog to rethink Brexit stocks trading ban,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The European Union's markets watchdog should reconsider its ban on trading thousands of shares outside the bloc if there is a no-deal Brexit, a senior French government official said on Wednesday.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) stunned exchanges last month when it said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, 6,200 mostly EU-listed shares, but also 14 UK stocks, could only be traded on platforms inside the bloc.
London is Europe's biggest share trading center, used by fund managers from across the continent who would be forced to accept less attractive prices if cut off from Britain.
""The good thing is that ESMA has taken a decision, sometimes you see that in other places it is difficult to have a decision,"" said Sebastien Raspiller, head of the financial sector department at France's finance ministry.
""The bad news is that the decision was not good, so I hope that ESMA would be able to reconsider its position,"" Raspiller told the annual meeting of derivatives industry body ISDA in Hong Kong.
ESMA's so-called ""share trading obligation"" decision has been described by some industry officials as a ""land grab"" by an EU keen to build up its own capital markets as Britain leaves the bloc.
Pan-European share trading platforms Cboe, Turquoise (part of the London Stock Exchange) and Aquis Exchange have had to change their no-deal Brexit plans in recent days following ESMA's ruling, warning that splitting trading liquidity would hurt investors.
Britain's markets watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has called on ESMA to discuss the ruling. The FCA could reciprocate with a ban on trading UK and even some liquid EU shares outside the United Kingdom.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is asking EU leaders on Wednesday for a further delay to Brexit until at least the end of June, and Raspiller said uncertainty over Brexit was damaging for market participants.

1137,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",The $100 Billion Man: Aramco CEO Delivers Record-Breaking Bond,"(Bloomberg) -- When Amin Nasser met investors at the palatial St. Regis hotel in midtown Manhattan last week, the chief executive officer of the world’s biggest oil company had one clear message: we’re in a league of our own.
After a bruising two years of being buffeted by delays to an initial public offering, investor skepticism over the valuation and profound change within Saudi Arabia, the CEO was here to set Wall Street straight: “Saudi Aramco is no ordinary oil company,” the 60-year-old petroleum engineer told his audience, according to a person who was present.
A week later, it’s clear the bankers believed him. Aramco sold $12 billion of bonds yesterday in what was one of the most oversubscribed offerings in history. In an incredibly rare turn, demand was so high that the company was able to borrow at a lower yield than its sovereign parent. More importantly, the sale demonstrated Saudi Arabia’s return to the global capitalist fold after being ostracized over the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi last year.
For Nasser, the bond sale is the apotheosis of his career, all the more remarkable because the revelations it brought would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. After decades of secrecy, Aramco has in quick succession revealed its balance sheet, the status of oil fields and the financial relationship with the government, its only shareholder.
Strong Reputation
“Aramco executives have a strong reputation, they are straight shooters,” said Jim Krane, an energy research fellow at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston. “If they say they are going to do something, they do it.”
Aramco, which pumps about one in every 10 oil barrels globally, isn’t just the world’s most profitable company, easily outpacing American titans such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., it’s also the cash cow sustaining the entire kingdom.
Even with that track record, the task of selling debt was daunting. For the first time in four decades, the company would be answerable to someone other than the government. While Aramco was already regarded as a well-run company, comparable to any international competitor, the search for bond investors required a whole new public vocabulary as officials for the first time answered questions on balance sheets and cash flows.
To accomplish the transition, Nasser surrounded himself with a small team of executives, all of whom went from anonymity to Wall Street A-list within a week.
Global Roadshow
Among them was Khalid Dabbagh, who became chief financial officer only a year ago, and Motassim al-Ma’Ashouq, the treasurer who led the preparations for Aramco’s now delayed IPO. Both handled most of the global roadshow, according to people familiar with the presentations, who asked not to be identified because the meetings were private. Other senior managers such as Yasser Mufti, the head of strategy, also pitched in.
Collectively, they delivered what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presumably wanted: a blockbuster deal, attracting almost $100 billion in orders, that was so sought after it actually reduced overall borrowing costs for the kingdom.
The company’s profile combined with investors’ hunt for yield in emerging markets made the bond offering irresistible for many, said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. In an era of diminishing or negative yields, Aramco’s longest-dated bonds received the strongest demand.
Global Community
Those seeking to use the sale as a gauge of Saudi Arabia’s rehabilitation into the global community should take that into account, said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a specialist in the political economy of the Middle East. “The success of the Aramco bond debut says more about global investor appetite,” she said.
Aramco has also deployed an army of investor relations specialists over the past two years, initially focused on the planned IPO and then the bond sale. Fergus MacLeod, formerly head of investors relations at  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, led the effort with Louise Hough, a 25-year veteran at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, and Ruban Chandran, another BP alumni.
Bond Roadshow
The success of the bond roadshow was in contrast to their efforts on the IPO, where most investors balked at the suggested valuation of $2 trillion. While equity investors were anxious about oil prices and dividends, the bond traders cared more about yields and a pristine balance sheet. Aramco was able to deliver on both.
Talks with bond investors accelerated earlier this year as Nasser embarked on several days of back-to-back meetings on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By then, the focus was on the debt sale rather than the IPO. Both would be able to generate the funds needed for the crown prince’s agenda of economic and social reform.
For Nasser, perhaps more at ease with Saudi geology than Wall Street finances, the deal is the culmination of a 37-year career that began in the vast oil fields of the desert kingdom. He wound up as the company’s chief petroleum engineer before his elevation to the CEO role in 2015. His predecessor, Khalid Al-Falih, is the current energy minister.
As Aramco priced the bonds in New York on Tuesday evening, Nasser was back in the kingdom for a dinner with the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Abdullah Jum’ah, who ran the company from 1995 to 2009, welcomed him back home as “the $100 billion man”.

Xavier Musca, deputy chief executive officer of the French lender, told journalists that there were too many investment banks not sufficiently focused on their business.
But Credit Agricole already restructured in 2011 and 2012 to downsize the investment bank to refocus, he said.
""We will not announce a restructuring,"" Musca said. ""We will need to reduce costs, but it will not be a restructuring as announced by others."" 
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) plans to cut 1,600 jobs, mainly at its corporate and investment banking arm, in an attempt to boost profits after a poor performance last year, France's third-largest bank said on Tuesday.
And Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is considering scaling back its bond and equity sales and trading operations in London and New York as part of a broader restructuring of its global markets division, two sources said on Tuesday.
Musca said the bank would announce a medium-term strategic plan on June 6 but that radical change was not in store. 
""We have a good business model, and we will not change it,"" he told a club of business journalists in Frankfurt on Tuesday evening. The comments were embargoed for Wednesday.
Musca is also chairman of the board of directors at Amundi, the asset manager mostly owned by Credit Agricole. 
Musca said that Amundi was open to acquisitions, though focused on organic growth.
""We consider Amundi as a natural consolidator in Europe, in particular in the euro zone,"" he said. ""We have capabilities to buy a lot of things, because we are a strong bank and have capacity to invest.""

President Donald Trump's threat this week to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, including commercial aircraft, has deepened a long-running trans-Atlantic subsidy dispute. 
The United States and Europe have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to Airbus and Boeing to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
""A clash between Boeing and Airbus would be absurd simply because our two industries are totally intertwined, we depend on each other for a number of components,"" Bruno Le Maire said in remarks at the French Institute of Foreign Relations. 
""A commercial war between Boeing and Airbus will only play into the hands of COMAC,"" he added, referring to Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.
COMAC is leading China's push to become a global civil aerospace player. In November the company and Russia's United Aircraft Corp unveiled a life-sized model of a proposed widebody longhaul jet, and in December COMAC'S C919 narrowbody passenger jet completed its first test flight. 
Le Maire said Europe had the means to retaliate to any U.S. sanctions on EU goods, but added: ""It is infinitely preferable that together with our U.S. allies we find the path toward a compromise.""

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Volkswagen eyes big stake in China partner JAC, taps Goldman - sources","By Julie Zhu and Arno Schuetze
HONG KONG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is exploring purchasing a big stake in its Chinese electric vehicle joint venture partner JAC Motors and has tapped Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as an adviser on the plan, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
The move by VW, the largest foreign automaker in China, to buy into Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC Motors) is the latest by foreign automakers to boost ownership in the world's biggest car market since Beijing relaxed rules last year. 
Rival German automaker BMW agreed in October to buy control of its main joint venture in the country for 3.6 billion euros ($4.05 billion). And  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) also plans to increase its stake in local partner BAIC Motor. 
The stake purchase move shows that JAC would be a key player in VW's big global bet on EVs and on strong Chinese demand for such vehicles. VW plans to shift a large part of its planned EV production in China to JAC if it ends up getting control of JAC, said one of the people. 
Foreigners were previously prevented from controlling any Chinese automaker or joint venture. Beijing last year removed such caps for firms making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Limits on commercial vehicles makers ease in 2020 and by 2022 for the wider car market.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised the European Union on Tuesday that Beijing would no longer force foreign companies to share sensitive know-how when operating in China and was ready to discuss new global trading rules on industrial subsidies.
VW, which has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, does not currently own shares in Shanghai-listed JAC, which has a market value of more than $1.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
The German car giant's plans are at an early stage but it is keen to take a big stake, said three of the people. Two of them said it will seek to buy shares from JAC's major shareholders, which, Refinitiv data showed, are mainly state-backed firms owning over 40 percent.
JAC's parent, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holding, holds a 24 percent stake and is fully controlled by the local government.
When contacted by Reuters, VW said: ""We are carefully watching what the implications are for our business and for our joint venture partners. In this regard we will explore all possible options together with all stakeholders to secure long-term success in China.""
JAC and its parent didn't respond to requests for comment. Goldman declined to comment. The people declined to be identified as the matter was confidential.
JAC is trading at a price-to-book ratio of 0.93, which means VW would have to pay a premium for shares since JAC's state shareholders cannot sell shares for less than their book value.
The Chinese automaker's shares jumped and hit the daily 10 percent maximum increase limit on Wednesday afternoon. VW shares were slightly lower in early trading.
""The news shows the bargaining power of companies like JAC and BAIC is stronger, and Volkswagen's and Daimler's determination to cooperate with Chinese partners in the long-term is also firm,"" said Patrick Yuan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Jefferies.
VW IN CHINA 
Wolfsburg-based VW, which delivered 4.21 million cars in mainland China and Hong Kong last year, has operated in China for decades. Besides JAC, it has joint ventures with state-owned FAW Group and SAIC Motor. 
It formed its 50:50 JV with JAC in 2017 to research and develop zero-emission passenger cars as the German automaker has committed almost one-third of the industry’s EV spending, about $91 billion. Separately, South Korea's SK Innovation Co said it is in talks to set up separate battery-making JVs with VW and Chinese partners, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
JAC, China's 11th largest local automaker by group sales, makes a range of commercial vehicles including pickup trucks and heavy duty trucks. It also produces vehicles for electric car maker NIO Inc. 
JAC warned in January of a 770 million yuan net loss for 2018 mainly due to a drop in car sales, compared to a 432 million yuan profit in 2017. Excluding exceptional items such as government subsidies, losses would reach 1.9 billion yuan, the company said. It will release annual results on April 30.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India trade ministry says no legal basis to ban e-cigarette imports - document,"By Aditya Kalra and Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's trade ministry says it cannot impose a ban on electronic cigarette imports as there is no legal basis for doing so, an internal government memo viewed by Reuters shows, in a boost for those looking to tap into the country's growing vaping market.
This comes amid repeated calls for a ban from the country's health ministry, which urged states and government agencies last year in an ""advisory"" to step up efforts to halt sales and imports, warning vaping devices pose a ""great health risk"".
The country has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative market for firms such U.S.-based Juul Labs and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) that plan to launch e-smoking devices in the country.
India's Jubilant group, one of whose units has the franchisee for Domino's Pizza and Dunkin' Donuts outlets in the country, is already exploring importing Juul's vaping device, a company letter shows.
Halting imports of e-cigarettes into India will be against multilateral commitments with the World Trade Organization, according to the internal government memo dated March 18.
The country must first prohibit local sales through federal regulations that ""can stand the scrutiny of law"", the memo adds.
Once that is done, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) can announce an ""import ban"", the memo said.
As of now, the health ministry's ""advisory"" cannot be a legal basis for a ban, the trade ministry, which has the power to impose import bans, said in the memo that is not yet public.
The DGFT did not respond to a request for comment.
A health ministry official said the ministry will work with the DGFT to explore how a ban can be imposed.
JUBILANT & JUUL
India's $12 billion cigarette market is dominated by companies such as ITC and Godfrey Phillips, both of which also sell e-cigarettes.
Its vapor-products market was valued at $15.6 million in 2017 and is seen growing nearly 60 percent annually in the next few years, Euromonitor International estimates.
Keen to tap into this growth, Juul has hired new executives in India and plans to launch its products in the country by late 2019, Reuters has previously reported.
But India's health ministry has called to block Juul's entry, saying its product was ""harmful"" and could undermine India's tobacco-control efforts.
A Jubilant unit, however, said in a letter to the health ministry dated Jan. 11, that it had identified Juul as a ""highly safe"" product which has ""benefited millions of consumers"".
Jubilant Offshore said in the letter it was in ""advanced stages"" of importing and selling e-cigarettes in the country.
A Jubilant spokesman said ""we believe there is demonstrable scientific evidence"" that such products are a viable alternative to cigarettes and that the group is ""exploring the category"".
Juul said it was in the process of evaluating India by having conversations with stakeholders.
The benefits of e-cigarettes, most of which vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, have been a topic for much debate in the global public health community.
Some say it helps shift smokers to less harmful products, but others argue it could create a new generation of addicts.
As of 2016, e-cigarettes were banned in 30 of World Health Organization's 195 member states. In India, about a third of its 29 states currently ban e-cigarette sales.

The country, home to the world's second-largest population at 1.3 billion, has tough laws to deter tobacco use, which the government says kills more than 900,000 people annually.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",How Trafigura lost $254 million on oil and gas hedges,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - One of the world's biggest traders, Trafigura, booked a $254 million loss from oil and gas market hedges last year, highlighting the challenges traders face when taking large loans to protect against price swings in illiquid commodities.
To be sure, those losses are on paper and could be eliminated or turn into gains in the future if the market turns in Trafigura's favor. Or they could get bigger if the opposite happens. 
The hedging losses at privately owned Trafigura, which made a net profit of $873 million last year, have not been previously reported.
Like many other trading houses, Trafigura has moved into the fast-growing, global market for liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Privately owned traders Vitol and Gunvor and listed  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) are also expanding in LNG and said they were using hedges to protect their exposure in that sector.
In 2018, Trafigura signed a deal with U.S. company Cheniere to buy LNG for 15 years and export it to Europe and Asia. On signing the deal, Trafigura hedged its exposure to U.S. LNG prices against sharp price moves in the rest of the world.
But hedging LNG is complicated and contains risks, says Trafigura's own 2018 report and its auditor PwC, which reviewed and signed off on Trafigura's accounts for last year.
To hedge the deal, Trafigura had to rely on a combination of liquid prices such as those of U.S. natural gas or Brent crude and assumptions on the correlation of those liquid benchmarks to illiquid global LNG prices for up to five years forward.
""This hedge is not perfect but it is the best one available out there at the moment,"" a Trafigura source said. As the LNG market develops, he said, more instruments will appear.
""It is extremely difficult to effectively hedge these long-term contracts, especially in a new market like LNG,"" said Arnaud Vagner, founder of Iceberg Research. Vitol also said contract maturities created hedging complexities.
BIG VALUE MOVES
International financial reporting standards (IFRS) require companies to mark-to-market - or measure the changes in fair value over time - the short and long positions they use for hedging.
In addition to LNG, Trafigura in 2018 hedged its U.S. oil pipeline and refining deals against sharp moves in U.S. crude versus Brent prices. 
To hedge LNG, pipelines and refining Trafigura built a short position with a fair value loss of around $1.9 billion using liquid instruments such as Brent, U.S. natural gas and diesel.
The margin calls were financed via a revolving credit facility and other bank lines adding to Trafigura's debt, which stands at a total of $32 billion. Its adjusted net debt - debt less cash and inventories - stands at $6 billion.
On the other side of the hedge – the long side – Trafigura had fair value gains of $1.75 billion from LNG, pipelines and refining deals. The LNG portion of the gains was $646 million.
Fair value gains and losses were up more than 10-fold compared to 2017, before Trafigura entered into those LNG, pipeline and refining hedging deals.
Fair value gains and losses impact both balance sheet and profits as they are included in the cost of sales.
Because the short position was built on liquid instruments, the fair value losses belonged to the so-called level 1 accounting hierarchy - the strictest category that makes few assumptions.
By contrast, fair value gains were based on level 2 and, in the case of LNG, on level 3, the most judgmental category in the fair valuation accounting hierarchy, which is mainly based on price modeling rather than market prices.
""Changes in these estimates may significantly impact the group's future results,"" said PwC, adding that it was still able to conclude that judgments were reasonable and free from bias.
""Level 3 gives a lot of flexibility to commodity traders as in practice future prices are whatever the trader has decided they would be,"" Iceberg's Vagner said.
PERFORMANCE RISK
As losses from the shorts exceeded gains from the longs, Trafigura had to book a $254 million loss representing a reduction of 22 percent of the potential net profit it would have otherwise achieved in 2018.
Besides mid-term price risk, such hedges also bear the longer-term risk of deals falling apart.
For example, in the unlikely event the United States bans LNG exports, traders would be stuck with shorts against non-performing longs.
""When you hedge market risk, you take performance risk. This is how hedging works,"" the Trafigura source said, adding that ""the performance risks can be mitigated notably by insurance mechanisms"". 
Vagner said: ""The LNG contract is 15 years long. This type of contract is risky as anything can happen to your supplier and its market during that time"".
Vagner is known for having accused Singapore-based trader Noble Group of using fair value accounting to inflate profits. Noble denied the allegations but subsequently defaulted and sold many of its assets as profits collapsed. 
By contrast, Trafigura said it uses fair value accounting only on its hedging deals, inventories and certain other financial instruments.
""We don’t take profit or loss on unrealized physical transactions. Traders are remunerated on their realized performance,"" the Trafigura source said.
Officials and sources at other trading houses also said they were not booking unrealized profits from LNG hedges.

""Gunvor only mark-to-markets contracts in the active trading period,"" a spokesman said, without specifying the timeframe.

An easing in financial conditions has helped reduce downside risks considerably, Goldman economists including Jan Hatzius and David Choi wrote in a note. Signals by the Federal Reserve that its interest-rate hiking cycle is on hold have played a role in lifting sentiment.
""The Fed’s dovish shift was likely designed to decrease downside risks, and our findings suggest that this has largely worked as planned,"" they wrote.
Still, with better growth momentum and improving financial conditions, the Fed may need to reconsider their pause at some point, according to Goldman’s analysis.
""As the lingering effects of the Q4 tightening gradually fade away, the Fed may eventually be willing to revisit the need for patience, as indicated in the January minutes,"" they wrote.

Investing.com --  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), the U.K.’s biggest supermarket chain, is emerging from a nightmare that began four years ago with an accounting scandal.
At least, that’s CEO Dave Lewis’s conclusion after the grocer reported a solid set of numbers for the three months through March (the last quarter of its fiscal year) on Wednesday, thanks largely to the performance of wholesaler Booker, which it bought last year.
The numbers will give long-suffering shareholders more confidence that it can continue to hold its own in a notoriously competitive market, where it faces the twin threat of online competition and aggressive German discounters Aldi and Lidl.
The shares rose 1.4% in response, before trimming gains later. They're still close to a six-month high, although still barely half the level they were when it emerged that its managers had been padding the accounts by booking revenues prematurely - a tactic that backfired badly when the expected revenues failed to materialize.
Lewis, who replaced Philip Clarke as CEO after the scandal came to light, said Tesco’s “continued capital discipline and strong improvement in cash profitability” had allowed it to nearly double its dividend this year to 5.77 pence (most of it coming with a final 4.10p interim payout announced today).
It’s the first major earnings release of the quarter in Europe, and it’s a reminder that, in a quarter dominated by headlines about Brexit and the global economic slowdown, domestic demand in Europe is still relatively strong. Average earnings in the U.K. are growing at their fastest in 10 years, and have outpaced inflation for a full year.
Markets across Europe opened brightly Wednesday, after the White House played down suggestions that it was opening a new front in a trade war by preparing tariffs against EU imports in response to what it sees as unfair subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus.
At 04:00 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.38 points, or 0.1% at 386.52. Germany’s Dax was up 0.4%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1%, a reflection of another Brexit-related uptick in sterling.
A big negative outlier was U.K. drugmaker Indivior (LON:INDV), which fell as much as 68% after U.S. prosecutors accused it of lying about the risks of its opioid Suboxone Film. The stock has now lost over 90% from its peak last year, when its problems with the U.S. authorities started to emerge."

Shares of ASOS (LON:ASOS) climbed after the British online fashion retailer stuck to its full year guidance for sales, profit margins and capital expenditure despite a plunge in first-half pretax profit.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>",Investor activists will campaign against Sturm Ruger directors,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investor activists said on Monday they will campaign to unseat two directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co, citing what they called its resistance to their concerns after shareholders won a battle over safety at last year's annual meeting.
The plan for this year's gathering, set for May 8 in New Hampshire, promises to renew a debate over how the company might respond to a series of mass shootings across the United States, including at schools, houses of worship and workplaces.
The activists include Majority Action, a liberal-leaning shareholder group, and religious investors affiliated with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. While they hold a small number of Sturm Ruger shares, last year members of Interfaith Center won backing for a resolution from fund companies including top Ruger shareholders BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group, showing an ability to set the agenda.
This year the activists said they will call on other investors to vote ""withhold"" on Sturm Ruger Chairman Michael Jacobi and on company director Sandra Froman, who is also a director of the National Rifle Association and was its president from 2005 to 2007.
Eli Kasargod-Staub, Majority Action's executive director, said in an interview that Sturm Ruger should take a harder look at ""smart gun"" technology and hold talks with investors, dialogue it has rejected in the past.
He also said the company should step back from divisive cultural issues promoted by the NRA. Together, the topics ""are the kind of issues that can and have been productively engaged on through dialogue with long-term investors at other companies,"" he said.
A Sturm Ruger spokesman did not respond to messages on Monday.
Sturm Ruger and Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands Corp have faced new attention from gun safety activists after 17 people were killed at a mass shooting at a Florida high school in early 2018. 
At Sturm Ruger's annual meeting last May a resolution that called on the company to produce a report on the safety of its products won about two-thirds of votes cast over the company's opposition. The document issued in February outlines safety features, improved background checks and other steps Sturm Ruger has taken, though the company cast doubt on the viability of smart guns and other technical changes suggested by the activists. 
Top fund firms also backed all company directors despite their rare stance of avoiding talks with investors. 
Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Christopher Killoy said at the meeting that fair disclosure rules kept it from speaking with BlackRock or Vanguard, although such meetings are common elsewhere.

The Wall Street bank, which currently owns 37.4 percent in Shenzhen-based Morgan Stanley Huaxin, won the bid on March 30 to buy the additional stake for 25.04 million yuan ($3.73 million), according to the auction notice on Taobao.com.
Morgan Stanley is buying the stake from a private shareholder in a court-appointed auction, which will see its stake surpass that of Huaxin Securities, which owns 39.56 percent of the joint venture. The purchase needs to be approved by China's securities regulators.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Moves by Morgan Stanley to boost ownership in the fund venture comes as China is opening up its financial sector worth trillions of dollars – from insurance to asset management and brokerage - for bigger foreign participation.
    China has in recent months allowed many foreign financial institutions to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in domestic joint ventures.
    Under new rules announced in late 2017, Beijing has also paved the way for foreigners to own up to 51 percent in their local mutual fund ventures.
    Besides the fund management business, Morgan Stanley also has a securities joint venture with Huaxin, in which the Wall Street bank raised its stake to 49 percent in 2017. The bank has previously expressed an interest in raising the stake further.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>","Nissan brand Infiniti aims to launch first electric car in three years, made in China","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - The first electric car for Nissan Motor Co's premium brand Infiniti will be a sporty sedan produced in China, the Japanese carmaker said in a statement viewed by Reuters ahead of a public announcement expected as soon as Wednesday.
The vehicle would hit the market in around three years, and consumers would get a taste when the company unveils a concept car, dubbed the Qs Inspiration electric sedan, at the Shanghai auto show later this week, Nissan officials said.
""China has the most growth potential for electric vehicles globally, especially in the premium segment,"" Infiniti Chairman Christian Meunier said in the statement seen by Reuters.
Automakers operating in China have to sell more so-called new-energy vehicles, either battery electric cars or plug-in electric hybrids, to comply with official production quotas designed to reduce smog. 
It was not immediately clear whether Infiniti planned to produce its first electric vehicle in other markets. An Infiniti spokesman said, however, the brand did not intend to export the e-sedan from China.
The planned e-sedan is part of Infiniti’s longer-term strategy to significantly ""electrify"" its product lineup. 
Brand officials have said that from 2021 every Infiniti model launched will be either an all-electric car or so-called ""e-Power"" hybrids, underlining Nissan’s previously announced plan to make Infiniti primarily an electrified offering.
The e-sedan likely would be built on a new flexible architecture developed specifically to accommodate electrified powertrains, Infiniti said in the statement. 
Its design, especially the interior, would be significantly different to current models, design chief Karim Habib said. EVs do not have bulky gasoline engines and transmissions, opening up space inside the car. 
""It will have a flat floor, and if you are a passenger you can cross your legs or stretch out your legs,"" Habib told Reuters. 
Competition in China’s rapidly emerging electric car market is heating up amid an onslaught of models from startups such as Nio and WM Motor, as well as those from established automakers.
In the luxury segment, Infiniti will be competing with the top-selling Model S and Model X by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, as well as other models due to be launched in coming months by Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Lexus.

Tianhong Yu'e Bao scrapped personal investment quota requirements and a daily subscription cap effective April 10, Tianhong Asset Management Co, the fund's manager, said in a statement late Tuesday.
The asset manager said the latest move was meant to ""better meet investors' wealth management demand"". The earlier restrictions were introduced to keep the Tianhong Yu'e Bao money market fund ""in prudent operation in the long run"", the statement said.
Under the previous rules, individuals were allowed to invest up to a maximum account value of 100,000 yuan ($14,892.25) and daily investments were capped at 20,000 yuan. 
The elimination of quota requirements and daily caps represent the first relaxation of rules for individual investors following a slew of tightening moves over the past two years.
Faced with rising regulatory pressure to shrink its size amid worries over potential systemic risks, Tianhong started to take measures to control the pace of growth of its money market fund in 2017, cutting individual account limits several times.
Market analysts said risk appetite has greatly improved since the start of this year with investors preferring stocks and bonds to money market funds, while expectations of easier monetary policy have pushed yields on money market products lower. These changes have led to a rise in redemptions and a drop in the size of money market mutual funds.
Launched in 2013, the Tianhong-managed Yu'e Bao fund is the world's largest money market fund. It held 1.13 trillion yuan in net assets at the end of 2018, according to its annual report, down from 1.58 trillion yuan a year earlier. In addition to the Tianhong fund, the Yu'e Bao platform offers 13 money market funds from outside fund managers.

Ant Financial Group owns a 51 percent stake in Tianhong Asset Management Co.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has decided it will seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock in its initial public offering, and will make public the registration of the offering on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
An IPO of this size would make Uber one of the biggest technology IPOs of all time, and the largest since that of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014.
Uber is seeking a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion, influenced by the poor performance of smaller rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's shares following its IPO late last month, the sources said. Investment bankers previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion.
Uber most recently was valued at $76 billion in the private fundraising market.
Most of the shares sold would be issued by the company, while a smaller portion would be owned by Uber investors cashing out, one of the sources said. 
Uber plans to make its IPO registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission publicly available on Thursday, and will kick of its investor roadshow during the week of April 29, putting it on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, the sources said. 
The sources cautioned that the plans are still subject to change and market conditions, and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A representative for Uber declined to comment. 
Lyft's IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion. But the stock has traded poorly since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startup's path to profitability have become more prominent. The shares ended trading on Tuesday at $67.44, well below their $72 IPO price.
In moderating its valuation expectations, Uber is showing a realism that is being increasingly adopted by Silicon Valley unicorns, as stock market investors push back against some of the lofty price tags sought.
On Monday, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc set a price range for its IPO that values it below the $12 billion at which the online image-search company sourced its last private fundraising in 2017.
Uber operates in more than 70 countries. In addition to ride-hailing, its business includes bike and scooter rentals, freight hauling, food delivery, and an expensive self-driving car division. 
During the IPO roadshow, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company’s culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.
Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.

Uber last year had revenue of $11.3 billion, while gross bookings from rides was $50 billion. But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.

Rolls-Royce said customers will be formally informed of the accelerated inspection regime on Wednesday and that its guidance for in-service cash costs on the Trent 1000 in 2019 and 2020 remains unchanged.
""This blade deterioration is a known issue but it is occurring faster than we expected on some engines,"" said Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce President for Civil Aerospace. 
Singapore Airlines Ltd grounded two Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787-10 jets fitted with Trent 1000 TEN engines last week after checks of its fleet found premature blade deterioration.
The Trent 1000 TEN is the latest version of an engine that has had a problematic entry into service. As of late February, Rolls-Royce said 35 787s were grounded globally due to engine blades corroding or cracking prematurely. The manufacturer said it was aiming to reduce the number to 10 by the end of the year.
In February, the company raised a Trent 1000 accounting charge to 790 million pounds ($1.03 billion) from 554 million pounds at the half year, contributing to a full-year operating loss of 1.16 billion pounds. It also allocated another 100 million pounds in cash to the problem.

Rolls-Royce said that since the entry into service of the Trent 1000 TEN, it had communicated to operators that the high-pressure turbine blades in the engine would have a limited life.

The route is the most direct internet link yet between Australia and China.
It also includes a connection to Madang in PNG and possible branches to Port Moresby and to Honiara in the Solomon Islands - connections Huawei had agreed to make before Australia blocked its project there last year on security grounds.
The SubCom cable would likely stifle any commercial case for future Huawei cables in the region, according to Jonathan Pryke, director of Pacific Islands research at Sydney-based think-tank the Lowy Institute.
""From a development point of view, it's great,"" he told Reuters. ""It would greatly increase the accessibility of internet in PNG.""
SubCom said it was commissioned to build the $380 million line by H2 Cable, a privately-owned Singapore-based firm, in a joint statement. It is due for completion in 2022 and also includes a possible trans-Pacific branch to Los Angeles.
Submarine cables, which can handle more information much faster and cheaper than satellites, carry the vast bulk of the globe's telecommunications traffic. That makes them strategically sensitive pieces of infrastructure.
In the South Pacific, where they are sorely needed to improve expensive and slow satellite internet connections, cable construction has proven a flashpoint between China and Western powers seeking to contain its growing influence there.
Huawei, which won a tender to build a domestic cable network in Papua New Guinea in 2016 and also uses Madang as a hub, was shut out of building an international cable to Australia amid concern over the company's links to China's government.
The company says the concerns are unfounded. Australia promised to build the cable itself. 
SubCom, which was sold by  TE Connectivity  Ltd (NYSE:TEL) last year to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, said the new cable would improve connectivity in the region and H2 said it would also boost capacity and speeds for Australia.
It was cautiously welcomed in the Solomon Islands, though there was some scepticism as to whether proposed branches would ever be built.

""All options for meshing the Pacific Islands are good for the development of the economies of these countries,"" said Keir Preedy, chief executive of the Solomon Island Submarine Cable Company Ltd, which is developing the Solomons' new cable.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: SK Innovation in talks to set up EV battery JVs with Volkswagen, China partners","By Joseph White, Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Innovation Co Ltd is in talks to set up separate battery-making joint ventures with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Chinese partners, as the South Korean petrochemicals producer aggressively expands its involvement in electric vehicles (EVs).
The company confirmed talks with Germany's Volkswagen for the first time, telling Reuters the pair were discussing building a factory together. It also said it was on the cusp of agreeing to build a plant in China with undisclosed partners.
The talks come as EV battery makers boost capacity to cope with fast-growing demand, as automakers race to develop vehicles powered by means other than petrol to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations worldwide.
SK Innovation, South Korea's biggest oil refiner, is a latecomer to a market led by compatriots LG Chem Ltd and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd plus Japan's Panasonic Corp. Since starting mass production in 2012, customers have included Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) as well as Volkswagen.
""Compared with rivals, we've been matching or exceeding investment in the area since last year,"" YS Yoon, president of SK Innovation's battery business, said in an interview. ""We tried to find the right moment for massive investment.""
The broader SK Group, South Korea's third-biggest conglomerate, has increased focus on EV batteries as demand slows at memory chip-making unit SK Hynix Inc.
By 2022, SK Innovation plans to spend 4.51 trillion won ($3.95 billion) to boost EV battery capacity. Last month, it broke ground on a $1.7 billion plant in the United States to primarily supply lithium-ion battery cells to Volkswagen. It is also building two factories in Hungary.
""Our strategy is to keep up with technological advancement by having relationships with some of our key customers,"" Yoon said, adding that ""nothing has been decided"" regarding a JV with Volkswagen.
The JV would be the first in which Volkswagen, one of the world's biggest automakers, will be co-investing in battery production, similar to the joint battery investment of Panasonic and U.S. EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, analysts said.
""We are considering an investment in a battery manufacturer in order to reinforce our electrification offensive and build up the necessary know-how,"" Volkswagen said in a statement to Reuters.
In March, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said the automaker was ""taking a close look at possible participation in battery cell manufacturing facilities in Europe of our own.""
Volkswagen's other suppliers include LG Chem, Samsung SDI and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd.
""There are so many battery requirements from Volkswagen,"" Yoon said. ""So I think it is natural for Volkswagen to have multiple suppliers even if it has joint ventures with some.""
SECOND CHINA PLANT
Separately, SK Innovation plans to soon sign a deal to build its second EV battery factory in China, the world's biggest EV market, Yoon said, without identifying the local partners.
The firm broke ground in August on its first Chinese plant under a joint venture with Beijing Electronics Holding Co Ltd and BAIC Motor Corp Ltd, with investment reaching 5 billion yuan ($744.30 million) by 2020.
SK Innovation had aimed to begin construction in 2016, but postponed as EVs equipped with Korean batteries were not included on a government list of EVs eligible for subsidies.
""We hope China's market opens up in 2021"" when the subsidies are phased out, Jay Rhee, SK Innovation's head of battery research and development, said in a separate interview.
COBALT CULL
Meanwhile, SK Innovation is in the industry-wide race to reduce batteries' cobalt content, with Panasonic in May saying it was working on a cobalt-free battery. The mineral is mined in harsh conditions and subject to significant price fluctuation.
The firm plans to start production of batteries containing 5 percent cobalt in 2022 from 10 percent at present, Rhee said.
Cobalt is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but SK Innovation is also sourcing cobalt from Australia and extracting the mineral from waste batteries, Yoon said.

""I expect we won't need to secure fresh cobalt after 2025,"" Yoon said.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.5% and 0.6% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 0.5%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%. Data on Wednesday showed the country’s core machinery orders increased 1.8% month-on-month in February, the first monthly increase in four months but fell short of the expected 2.5% increase.
 Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) slid as much as 7% after the company announced in a statement that a bailout deal that worth 110 billion yen ($990 million) gets delayed. It did not give a new timeline for the deal.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 edged up 0.2%.
 Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN) slumped 8.5% as Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) abruptly ended a $7.1 billion takeover deal talks after the offer is leaked. Crown’s shares was up as much as 20% the previous day after saying it was discussing a potential sale to Wynn.
“Following the premature disclosure of preliminary discussions Wynn resorts has terminated all discussions with Crown Resorts concerning any transaction,” Wynn said in a statement. The company’s stock also fell more than 3% following the news.
Investor sentiment took a hit on Wednesday after the IMF said it expects the global economy to grow by only 3.3% in 2019, down from its previous forecast of 3.5%.
“Higher trade policy uncertainty and concerns of escalation and retaliation would reduce business investment, disrupt supply chains, and slow productivity growth,” said the fund. “The resulting depressed outlook for corporate profitability could dent financial market sentiment and further dampen growth.”
Risk appetite was also dampened following Tuesday’s news that the U.S. is considering imposing new tariffs on European goods including new passenger helicopters, various cheeses and wines, ski-suits and certain motorcycles."
1160,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 09:46PM ET</span>",U.S. judge defers ruling on PG&E $350 million bonus plan,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday deferred a ruling on whether to approve a PG&E Corp plan to pay up to $350 million in bonuses to 10,000 employees, saying he wants more details from the California power producer that is facing bankruptcy following last year's wildfires.
Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco set April 23 as the next date for a hearing on the plan, saying he wants PG&E to give him a ""tutorial"" on it.
""It doesn't quite feel right yet,"" Montali said of the plan, noting he wanted a better understanding of how some of its performance measures will affect payouts.
The plan covers 2019 and takes the place of a previously proposed 2018 bonus program that the California power provider scuttled after criticism from wildfire victims and their lawyers.
San Francisco-based PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, facing the prospect of potentially billions of dollars in liabilities stemming from wildfires in California in recent years linked or suspected to be linked to its equipment.
The investor-owned power provider has said it expects its equipment will be found to have caused November's Camp Fire, California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire of modern times. The blaze killed 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.
The U.S. Trustee, the government's bankruptcy watchdog, had objected to the new plan, saying it was not clear if top company executives were excluded and expressing concern about its cost.
Montali said he found no evidence top executives were included. He hoped to rule on the plan after the next hearing, he said.
""I'm not going to make the 10,000 employees dangle in the wind,"" the judge said.
More than half of the plan's formula for calculating bonuses is pegged to how well employees help PG&E meet safety goals like clearing trees and branches around power lines to avert contact that triggers wildfires, a lawyer for the company said at Tuesday's hearing.
Stephen Karotkin of Weil Gotshal & Manges added that committees for PG&E's unsecured creditors, equity holders and some bond holders support the plan because they see it helping the company's reorganization effort.
""I can't emphasize enough the importance of bringing stability to this workforce,"" Karotkin said.
But those who had been affected by wildfires found the size of the proposed bonus plan difficult to stomach, said Robert Julian of the BakerHostetler law firm, who represents wildfire victims.
""The dollars are just too large,"" Julian said, adding his clients were also concerned about whether the plan will advance wildfire safety measures.
While the maximum cost of the plan is $350 million, PG&E has said it expects the likely cost will be around $235 million. PG&E has said it aims to remove 375,000 trees around power lines this year to avert the potential for its equipment sparking blazes during California's next wildfire season.
PG&E shares rose 0.4% to $18.90 in after-hours trading.

1161,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Brazil Will Pay Petrobras $9 Billion in Oil Contract Settlement,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian oil giant Petrobras will get $9.06 billion to settle a deep-water contract dispute with the government, ending years of negotiations and paving the way for Big Oil to access enormous crude deposits in the area.
Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque told reporters on Tuesday that compensation for a 2010 contract review will be paid in one settlement, though he didn’t provide details on how it will be made. The government also confirmed an Oct. 28 auction for the right to develop excess oil reserves beyond the 5 billion barrels Petrobras has the power to produce under the 2010 Transfer of Rights contract, also known as TOR. Petrobras will receive the payment after the auction is held.
Jair Bolsonaro is the third Brazilian president to try to unlock oil riches from the TOR area. Located under the Atlantic Ocean, it’s a section of the larger so-called pre-salt area, which holds Brazil’s biggest oil discoveries. Companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc have expressed interest in the deposits.
The government transferred the 5 billion barrels of undeveloped reserves to Petrobras in 2010 for a cost of $8.51 per barrel. The agreement included compensation if oil prices fell leading up to commercial production, which they did.
Petrobras started output in 2013 and found the TOR area to hold more crude than initially estimated. Burdened by huge debts, the company lacked the tens of billions of dollars needed to fully develop the discoveries. The government wants to auction the surplus volumes and start pumping the crude, but needed to resolve the contract with Petrobras first to remove the company’s exclusive exploration rights.
The additional volumes that can now be offered to oil majors can reach as much as 15 billion barrels. If that crude is commercially recoverable, it would represent about twice the proved reserves of Mexico or Norway.
The government has said the auction could raise as much as 100 billion reais ($25.9 billion) and reduce the South American country’s ballooning budget deficit.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 08:51PM ET</span>",Crown shares tumble after Wynn cancels $7.1 billion casino takeover,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Shares in Australia's Crown Resorts Ltd tumbled on Wednesday after U.S. casino giant Wynn Resorts Ltd quit discussions for a A$10 billion ($7.1 billion) buyout, although some investors appeared to be hoping for a change of heart.
Wynn, the world's second-largest casino operator, walked away from the deal after details of the offer, which had sent Crown shares soaring more than 20 percent, became public through a leak to an Australian newspaper.
The indicative offer for Australia's biggest casino operator had been viewed by investors as opportunistic but also only the beginning of a drawn-out pursuit. That is a lot less likely now.
""Wynn's actions are more likely to reflect a genuine frustration with a breach of the confidential nature of the discussions than an attempt to add pressure to the negotiation,"" said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, which holds Crown shares.
Crown stock dropped 10 percent at the open, then pared some losses to trade 8.5 percent under Tuesday's closing price, while the broader market fell 0.1 percent.
At A$12.86, the stock remained almost 10 percent higher than its last price before Wynn's approach was disclosed, suggesting hope for a deal had not completely evaporated.
""I reckon they will be back, but will play cold hand for a while,"" said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Perth's Argonaut Ltd and another Crown shareholder.
News of Wynn's interest was first broken by Australian Financial Review on Tuesday and confirmed by Crown, which also disclosed Wynn's offer price.
Wynn then issued two statements, first confirming the talks, and, a few hours later, stating that they had ended. Crown said in a statement it noted Wynn's decision. Wynn shares fell almost 4 percent in New York on Tuesday. 
The deal was to offer Wynn a hedge against Macau, the Chinese gambling hub where its license are up for renewal, by giving it two lavishly revamped Australian casinos and a third still being built on the prized Sydney harbor front.
The offer came as Crown is grappling with the effects of an economic slowdown in China, which has crimped revenue from high-rolling Chinese gamblers at its Australian tables.

1163,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",UBS's Haefele Sees Three Things Needed for More Stock Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks kicked off the second quarter with a roaring start, but UBS Group AG says the market may need help to keep going.
“For meaningful further upside from here, we would need to see indications that the growth stabilization is translating into an upswing, profit growth is continuing, and a flat yield curve is not translating into weaker bank lending,” UBS Wealth Management’s Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note April 8.
The torrid year-to-date rally in stocks has continued in the second quarter, even after a setback Tuesday. The MSCI All-Country World Index is up 1.8 percent this month, while the S&P 500 Index has advanced 1.6 percent. To Haefele, that signifies that investors are already expecting “a relatively benign scenario” and further increases may not be as easy to come by.
Equities have rallied strongly since bottoming on Dec. 24, as concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions eased, the Federal Reserve turned more dovish and China took policy steps to combat economic weakness. Volatility across assets is near historic lows. Amid that environment, the MSCI ACWI is about 6 percent off its January 2018 record, and the S&P 500 is about 2 percent below its September peak.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). agreed with the idea that economic performance is coming back to center stage.
“Better global growth needs to take over as a driver of risk appetite,” strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissmann and Alessio Rizzi wrote in a strategy paper on April 4. Though they cautioned, “the eventual recovery might disappoint and there is potential for further shocks from politics and rates.”
Sundial Capital Research found some amount of caution to be justified. The firm crunched numbers related to stock gains and profit growth for U.S. companies, analyzing more than 15 instances when the S&P 500 started first-quarter earnings season at or near a 100-day high to address concerns about whether shares could rally from here.
“There does seem to be some support for the worries, but it’s not very strong,” Sundial founder Jason Goepfert wrote in a note April 8. “The S&P has struggled a bit holding its gains when it’s already been rallying into earning season, and it has also struggled when earnings were forecast to slow from impressive growth to either less-impressive or outright negative year-over-year growth.”
Goepfert’s analysis found that the S&P 500 on average was down 0.3 percent after starting first-quarter earnings season at or near that 100-day high, though after six months that figure turned to a gain of 4.3 percent. One year later, on average, the benchmark was up more than 11 percent.
“The ‘pain trade’ might still be up, which can support risk appetite further,” Goldman’s Mueller-Glissmann and Rizzi wrote. “But without a sustained pick-up in global PMIs in the coming months, we believe risk appetite is unlikely to turn positive and remains vulnerable to shocks.”

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's legal troubles grew on Tuesday as a new lawsuit accused the company of defrauding shareholders by concealing safety deficiencies in its 737 MAX planes before two fatal crashes led to their worldwide grounding.
The proposed class action filed in Chicago federal court seeks damages for alleged securities fraud violations, after Boeing's market value tumbled by $34 billion within two weeks of the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX.
Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg and Chief Financial Officer Gregory Smith were also named as defendants.
Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers had no immediate comment.
According to the complaint, Boeing ""effectively put profitability and growth ahead of airplane safety and honesty"" by rushing the 737 MAX to market to compete with Airbus SE, while leaving out ""extra"" or ""optional"" features designed to prevent the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.
It also said Boeing's statements about its growth prospects and the 737 MAX were undermined by its alleged conflict of interest from retaining broad authority from federal regulators to assess the plane's safety.
Richard Seeks, the lead plaintiff, said Boeing's compromises began to emerge after the Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 onboard, five months after the Lion Air crash killed 189.
Seeks said he bought 300 Boeing shares in early March, and sold them at a loss within the last two weeks. The lawsuit seeks damages for Boeing stock investors from Jan. 8 to March 21.
Shareholders often file lawsuits accusing companies of securities fraud for concealing material negative information that causes the stock price to decline upon becoming public.
Chicago-based Boeing faces many other lawsuits over the crashes, including by victims' families and by participants in its employee retirement plans.
Boeing said on Tuesday that aircraft orders in the first quarter fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier, with no orders for the 737 MAX following the worldwide grounding.
On April 5, it said it planned to cut monthly 737 production to 42 planes from 52, and was making progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents. 

The case is Seeks v  Boeing Co  et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-02394.

The company in its statement did not say how many people it expected to lay off. 
Ford previously said the plant was operating with about 700 excess workers. The plant employs 7,400 people in Camaçari, where it produces the compact Ka and mid-sized EcoSport SUV.
The U.S. automaker said two months ago it would close its oldest plant in Brazil, in São Bernardo do Campo, which could cost more than 2,700 jobs as part of a restructuring meant to end losses around the world.
Referring to the Bahia plant, Ford said: ""The measure has the objective to align the plant's workforce with current market demand.""
Ford sold 24,000 Ka vehicles in Brazil in the first quarter, about the same level as in the previous year. It sold 7,600 EcoSports, more than the 7,000 reported in the first quarter of 2018.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 06:25PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer watchdog says 'all options on table' for enforcing Wells Fargo order,"By Michelle Price and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has told Congress that ""all options are on the table"" for enforcing a 2018 consent order against  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), raising the prospect of potential future penalties or other sanctions against the bank.
In a letter to Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown published by the lawmakers on Tuesday, CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger said she was unhappy with Wells Fargo's progress fixing its risk management issues.
""I am not satisfied with the bank's progress to date and have instructed staff to take all appropriate actions to ensure the bank complies with the consent order and Federal consumer financial law,"" she wrote in the letter dated April 5.
“Broadly speaking, I consider all options on the table for enforcing Bureau consent orders,"" Kraninger added.  
Wells Fargo Wells declined to comment. 
In April 2018, the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) jointly fined Wells Fargo $1 billion for mis-selling auto loans and mortgage products and ordered the bank to repay harmed customers and fix its controls and processes.
The terms of the consent order give Kraninger and OCC Director Joseph Otting extensive powers to sanction the bank with additional penalties, business restrictions or the removal of bank personnel if they believe it has failed to devise a satisfactory remediation plan.
""The OCC is fully engaged and prepared to ensure Wells Fargo corrects the identified deficiencies,"" Otting wrote in a separate April 3 letter to Warren.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, also writing to the senators on April 3, repeated his pledge to retain an asset cap the Fed imposed on the bank in February 2018 until it has met its obligations under that separate consent order.
The bank has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has already payed out tens of millions of dollars to make consumers whole. 
Senators Warren and Brown wrote to the three regulators on March 22 seeking reassurance that they would take a tough line on the bank and calling on them to remove Chief Executive Tim Sloan. Sloan announced he was resigning on March 28.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Sloan's departure was at least partly the result of the board's conclusion that he had failed to convince regulators that he could transform the bank and rally a staff that had low confidence in its leadership.

The deal left Deripaska and “related entities” with a 45 percent stake in Rusal, Mnuchin said Tuesday at a House Financial Services Committee hearing. Some shares of the company were transferred to Deripaska’s children through a divorce decree that “legally bound” him to do so, according to Mnuchin.
“They don’t have more than a majority,” Mnuchin said of Deripaska and his family.
Moscow-based Rusal won relief from U.S. sanctions after eight months of negotiations with the Treasury Department that led to Deripaska agreeing to reduce his ownership and relinquish control of the company.
The U.S sanctioned Deripaska last April as part of a package targeting allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin for interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He remains personally sanctioned."
1170,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 05:52PM ET</span>","For first time in a decade, U.S. companies could report lower profits on higher revenue","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street is bracing for large U.S. companies to report a decline in quarterly profits even after raking in higher revenues, something that has not happened in more than a decade.
S&P 500 companies due to report in the coming weeks face tough comparisons with last year, when the U.S. tax code overhaul helped boost profits by more than 20%. 
But with rising costs, some resulting from tariffs, analysts see profit margins shrinking by 1.1 percentage point, the first year-over-year decline in at least two years, IBES data from Refinitiv showed. 
""Companies are experiencing rising input costs as well as increases in labor costs from modestly rising wages,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 2.5% from a year earlier, which would mark the first quarterly U.S. decline since 2016. Revenue is meanwhile seen up 4.8%.
Costs for certain raw materials like aluminum have increased as the United States slapped tariffs on imports from China and other countries.
First-quarter earnings could be crucial to the bull market's continued success, with some investors seeing them as the catalyst to either lift stocks to all-time highs or pour cold water on the rally.
Stocks have bounced back from a late-2018 selloff on optimism that the United State could seal a trade deal with China and expectations the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates again any time soon. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is due to report on Wednesday, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co report on Friday. Results from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and some big industrial names like Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) are expected next week. 
DIVIDED OUTLOOK 
The last time profits fell while revenue grew was the third quarter of 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis. Still, strategists appear divided on what the rest of the year holds for earnings.
It is also not unusual for S&P 500 companies to top analyst expectations. 
Since 1994, S&P 500 earnings have beaten estimates by an average of 3.2%, based on Refinitiv data, and some strategists think the S&P 500 will end up posting growth for the first quarter.
And nearly 83% of earnings are beating analysts' expectations so far this quarter, based on the 23 S&P 500 companies that have already reported.
""Earnings bars for the first quarter are so low companies are going to trip over them,"" said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm.
Projected sales growth through the rest of the year may also help investors look through any first-quarter margin dips. 
""Revenue growth has been extremely stable throughout 2018 and is expected to remain so in the year ahead,"" Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York, wrote in a note on Monday. 
""We believe that investors will focus on the breadth and consistency of top-line results, versus 1Q margin pressures,"" wrote Golub.
WARNING SIGNS 
Other strategists are more cautious. First-quarter results are likely to mark the start of an S&P 500 profit recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of earnings declines, according to Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley's equity strategist.
""Our earnings growth leading indicator suggests (the first quarter) won't be the trough for this year,"" Wilson wrote in a note.
Warning signs are coming from technology companies, with semiconductors, which have a large revenue exposure to China, seen among the most sensitive to the trade conflict.
Tech stocks have outperformed the broader market so far this year, but Wilson said the sector had the biggest percentage of companies missing fourth-quarter margin estimates even as the number of management comments on margin expansion reached new highs.
Year-over-year first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 tech companies are expected to fall 6.1%, according to Refinitiv.
Wilson said margin results will be important to watch, and that wage pressures appear to be rising. He noted that the number of mentions of labor costs during earnings calls in the last reporting period was the highest since 2005. 
But first-quarter performance is expected to be uneven across sectors. 
Profit margins are eroding for several heavily weighted companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), but not across the board for S&P 500 companies, Golub said.
Despite a first-quarter surge, oil prices were still down from last year, and earnings from the S&P 500 energy sector are expected to drop 21.2%. 
The rallying dollar will likely be a negative for U.S. multinational companies, whose foreign currency earnings are worth less when the dollar is stronger. 
The dollar rose 6.2% on a trade-weighted basis in the quarter, its strongest performance on a year-over-year basis since the fourth quarter of 2015.

The dollar gains could mean a 2.4 percentage point drag on earnings in the quarter, said Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist and head of asset allocation at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York. But, he said, that drag is likely to lessen from here.

1173,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Snaps 8-Day Win Streak on Global Growth, Trade Scares","Investing.com - The S&P 500 snapped an eight-day winning streak as global growth jitters and concerns about escalating U.S. and EU trade tensions soured sentiment on U.S. stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.72%, the S&P 500 lost 0.61%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.56%.
The EU warned it stands ready to retaliate should the U.S. move ahead with tariffs on $11.2 billion worth of EU goods, raising fears that both the U.S. and the trading bloc are on a collision course. Both sides accuse the other of illegally subsidizing their respective aircraft makers, Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in the EU.
The dispute has been tied up in litigation since 2004, but came to the fore last May when the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus had received illegal government funding for its A380 and A350 models, adversely affecting Boeing's sales.
Trade aside, Boeing (NYSE:BA) came under fire after the aircraft maker said total orders, a measure of future demand, plunged to 95 aircraft in the first quarter from 180 a year earlier. The aircraft maker's much maligned 737 MAX jets saw orders plunge to zero following a worldwide grounding in March. Shares fell 1.5%.
Elsewhere, fears over global growth resurfaced, prompting investors to hold off of risky bets after the IMF cut its global growth outlook, citing Brexit-related uncertainties and U.S.-China trade tensions.
The IMF sees global economic growth of 3.3% this year, down from the 3.5% it forecast in January.
The broader market was also pushed back by falling energy stocks on the back of slump in oil prices as oversupply fears returned. The EIA lifted its forecast for 2019 and 2020 average U.S. oil production, while Russian President Vladimir Putin poured cold water on expectations for prolonged oil-production cuts, saying current oil prices were suitable for Moscow.
In tech, semis stumbled amid fears the rally in the sector so far this year has led frothy valuations in chips stocks.
“We downgrade semis to benchmark,” Morgan Stanley wrote in note Monday. ""The sector is now discounting above-trend growth in the U.S. We worry about a lengthening smartphone cycle.""
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) ended the day nursing losses.
With just a three days to go until JPMorgan and Wells Fargo kick off the first-quarter earnings season on Friday, investors are seemingly reining in bets on a bullish quarter, with many expecting a tough road ahead.
First-quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4.2% year over year for S&P 500 companies, according to FactSet, compared to a 3.9% decline forecast just one week ago.
On the economic front, weaker-than-expected U.S. job openings added to the day's gloom.

1174,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. CPI, Fed Minutes on Tap
The market’s economic attention turns to retail inflation tomorrow.
The Labor Department will issue its March consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the CPI rose 0.3% last month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%.
That would keep annual core inflation about in line with the Federal Reserve’s 2% target with a 2.1% rise for March.
The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday will release the minutes of its March meeting, during which the central bank signaled rate hikes had run out of road for this year and said it would halt its balance-sheet-reduction program in September.
The Fed cited slowing global growth and timid inflation as reasons for its dovish outlook. The minutes are expected to confirm consensus among Fed members for the central bank to continue with its patient approach on rate hikes.
2. More Pain Ahead for Crude Prices?
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a build.
The American Petroleum Institute data was released today. While not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, it often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. The numbers showed that weekly crude stockpiles rose by 4.1 million barrels last week. That was the third-consecutive weekly build.
The EIA, meanwhile, is expected to report a build of 2.294 million barrels for the week ended April 5.
Crude production will also garner attention. The EIA lifted its forecast for 2019 and 2020 average U.S. oil production to 12.4 million barrels per day and 13.1 million barrels a day, respectively, from a 12.3 million and 13 million forecast a month ago.
The report said WTI oil prices are now likely to average $58.80 a barrel this year, a near-5% increase from the U.S. energy department's forecast last month of $56.13 a barrel.
Crude oil futures settled 42 cents lower at $63.98 after Russian President Vladimir Putin dented expectations for prolonged oil-production cuts, saying the current level of oil prices were suitable for Moscow.
3. Delta, Bed Bath & Beyond to Report Results
Earnings season is starting to heat up and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will report before the bell tomorrow.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the giant airline to report first-quarter earnings of 89 cents a share on revenue of about $10.4 billion, up from 74 cents a share on revenue of $9.97 billion a year ago.
A key question analysts should have is how much of an impact higher oil prices will have on results. Fuel is around 25% of costs and crude oil is up 41% this year.
Delta has not been affected by Boeing (NYSE:BA) recent problems since it does not have 737 MAX jets in its fleet.
Shares are up about 15% this year.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) weighs in after the bell and is expected to report $1.12 a share in earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter on revenue of $3.34 billion. That would be down from $1.48 a share a year ago. Revenue is expected to be off about 10%.
The home-furnishings retailer has struggled in recent years as shoppers have moved online or been slower to make purchase decisions. Despite its results, the stock is up 61% this year.
And luxury-brand merchant Louis Vuitton is expected to report $13.75 billion in revenue for the quarter. That would be up 2.9% from a year ago. There was no estimate for earnings per American depositary unit. Louis Vuitton, headquartered in Paris, is best known for its leather-goods products. Other products include wines and spirts, fragrances and watches and jewelry."
1175,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street bull run hinges on earnings,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Optimism that the United States and China will soon reach a trade deal has helped propel stocks close to new highs, but the decisive factor in whether the bull market runs much further may be this year's corporate earnings.
Earnings season begins in earnest on Friday when JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co report quarterly results. Profit forecasts have been falling, and beating these lowered expectations could provide a catalyst for sustaining the rally that began a decade ago, investors say.
The S&P 500 has risen 14.8% so far this year and is now just 1.8% below its record closing high of 2,930.75 on Sept. 20 and even closer to the 2,900 median year-end forecast from market strategists polled by Reuters in February.
Rising expectations that a U.S.-China trade agreement is imminent have driven much of this year's gain in stocks, a reversal of the sharp sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Federal Reserve's move to pause interest-rate hikes has also helped fuel the run-up, outweighing concerns that the global economy is slowing.
Yet those factors may not be enough to sustain the bull run if corporate earnings are underwhelming. Risks remain on trade too, with U.S. trade official Clete Willems telling Reuters on Monday that the White House is ""not satisfied yet"" about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war. 
While earnings are expected to fall 2.5% year-over-year in the first quarter and register tepid growth in the second and third quarters, according to Refinitiv, consensus estimates have them rebounding in the fourth quarter, rising 8.9%.
""Whatever trade deal may come to fruition may cause a small short-term spike in markets, but it's largely priced in,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""Corporate earnings and economic data are much more critical.""
Especially worrying for investors is the potential of a corporate earnings recession, defined as at least two quarters of falling year-over-year profits, in 2019. First-quarter earnings are already projected to fall from 2018 figures, and further downward revisions to second-quarter estimates, currently at 2.5% year-over-year growth, could put them in negative territory as well.
""Almost all the earnings growth is backloaded into the end of the year,"" said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston. ""We're going to need a positive surprise in earnings to keep the engine running for strong market returns.""
Some believe that with lowered expectations, companies have ample room to surprise to the upside in their quarterly reports. Even if first-quarter profits decline, upbeat outlooks for the rest of the year could lift stocks.
Earnings estimates do not reflect the positive effect of lower interest rates, said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Lower rates also bode well for consumer confidence, Carey said.
""With a more benign interest-rate outlook, we could go back to more positive earnings projections,"" he said. ""It's a fairly major development.""
TRADE DEAL COULD PLAY ROLE IN EARNINGS
While many investors believe a U.S. trade agreement with China would provide only a limited boost to equities at this point, the effects of such a deal could play a significant role in earnings outlooks for the second half of the year.
Investors have sought to pinpoint how much of a slowdown in China's economic growth can be attributed to the effect of U.S. tariffs. 
If China's economy continues to slow even after a trade deal is reached, that malaise could inflame global economic fears once again, said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. That could trigger a flight away from shares of U.S. multinationals with high China exposure, similar to what occurred in the spring of 2018.
But several market watchers expect a rebound in Chinese economic growth as the country's stimulus measures take root and trade pressures are alleviated.
Such a recovery would bode well for U.S. corporate earnings, particularly in the technology sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, for instance, has risen 26.8% this year on the expectation that demand for chips will rebound as China's pace of economic growth is restored.

""If earnings growth firms up a little bit, that can drive the market higher,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. ""If we have a good U.S. economy and get China stimulus, you could make the argument that the environment for corporate earnings is positive.""

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>",U.S. shale producers turn to jobs cuts as investor pressures mount,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Having slashed spending plans and run out of willing buyers for assets, some U.S. shale producers are turning to workforce cuts as investors step up demands for returns.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co, one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, and Laredo Petroleum Inc another Permian producer, this week disclosed plans to shed workers.
Irving, Texas-based Pioneer declined to say how many of its about 3,200 employees would be cut. The company has not had a layoff since 1998. 
Severance packages will be offered and the company said it expects to dismiss workers by June. Pioneer has been trying to sell assets in South Texas to concentrate on the Permian for more than a year. 
In February, it released fourth-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street expectations and that same month Chief Executive Tim Dove agreed to retire.
Shale firms have pushed U.S. oil output to record levels. But years of heavy spending led to investor pressure to reduce spending and use the cash to provide payouts, rather than produce more oil.
Pioneer employees told a Midland, Texas, TV station that the company wanted to cut about 300 workers, or about 10 percent of its workforce.
Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Laredo Petroleum said on Tuesday it cut about 20 percent of its 340 employees, which would save the firm around $30 million per year. It also replaced its finance chief. 
Laredo had to make the staff cuts to ""focus on increasing corporate-level returns and growing within cash flow from operations,"" CEO Randy A. Foutch said in a statement.

Cash-strapped shale companies can expect increasing pressure from shareholders, analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a note to clients Tuesday. It forecast more industry job cuts ""over the coming quarters as companies address right-sizing the corporate cost structure.""

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Levi Strauss revenue rises 7 percent in first post-IPO quarterly report,"(Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) posted a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday in its first report after returning to public markets, as the jeans maker's strategy of expanding its retail stores and investing in its online business paid off.
The company's shares rose nearly 2 percent to $22.25 after the bell having ended the day trading up 2.6 percent.
They are down about 2.5 percent since the company's return to public markets in late March, but remain about 29 percent above the IPO price of $17, as investors bought into the blue jeans inventor's strong performance against the backdrop of a challenging U.S. retail environment.
Levi has branched out of its staple men's blue jeans into product lines such as T-shirts, fleeces and women's apparel to cater to changing customer preferences and the rise of ""athleisure"" pioneered by Lululemon Athletica Inc.
The efforts helped Levi's revenue rise about 7 percent to $1.43 billion in the first quarter ended Feb. 24, in line with the company's previous revenue expectation of between $1.42 billion and $1.44 billion.
Sales at Levi's direct-to-consumer business that includes company owned stores and its online channels grew 10 percent in the quarter. 
""Growth was broad-based across all three regions and all channels, demonstrating that our strategies are working and our investments are paying off,"" Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said.
Levi said net income attributable to the company was $146.6 million, or 37 cents per share, in the quarter, compared to a loss of $19 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company incurred a tax-related charge.
On an adjusted basis, net income grew 81 percent to $151 million.

Analyst estimates aren't available for Levi as the 12 IPO underwriters that included Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are in the research blackout period until next week.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",This Top China Investor Only Has Eyes for One Mainland Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- Out of more than 3,500 stocks listed in mainland China, this fund manager is only interested in one: Kweichow Moutai Co.
Michael Wan, chief investment officer at China Universal Asset Management (Hong Kong), says investors can’t ignore the well-known maker of baijiu liquor, which has already rallied 53 percent this year -- and over 14,000 percent since its 2001 debut in Shanghai. That’s made it China’s biggest distiller, and one of the most expensive.
“I’m still comfortable with its valuation. It is very rare a stock can enjoy a margin of as high as almost 90 percent. You can’t ignore this company’s ability to turn sales into earnings,” said Wan, whose fund has beaten 96 percent of peers in the past five years and more than doubled the MSCI China Index’s gain.
With its soaring returns, Moutai is hardly a rare pick for stock investors. The Guizhou-based company is the world’s most profitable distiller, maintaining gross margin at around 90 percent for at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wan believes the liquor maker could improve profitability further and says its business model is “irreplaceable.”
Moutai at Record High After Results Beat; Brokers Raise Targets
“We think Moutai’s selling prices still have upside. It may not lift prices very soon, but in the longer run, the upside could be very big,” Wan said in an interview in Hong Kong. “Demand for high-end liquor products will keep growing as the pool of wealthy individuals expands in China. It’s an ongoing consumption upgrade story.”
Top Pick
While Wan’s mandate allows him to invest up to 30 percent of his fund in non-Hong Kong stocks, on the mainland he still only has eyes for Moutai, which is at a record high 905 yuan ($135) and tipped by some analysts to be the first Chinese stock to cost 1,000 yuan. To buy more A shares, Wan said he may have to sell some current holdings and he’s not planning on doing that for now.
China Liquor Giant Set to Extend Rally as Slowdown Avoided
Trading at about 26 times forward earnings, Moutai is one of 2019’s best-performing large caps in China, where markets are rebounding from last year. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 30 percent, better than any other major equity gauge worldwide. To Wan, the company’s high valuation is also justified by a strong balance sheet that provides solid free cash flows.
“I don’t think the market is overly optimistic about Moutai,” he said. “You need to think about the quality of its earnings. They are earning cash, not account receivables.”
Wan’s other top holdings include AIA Group Ltd.,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. Moutai is his fourth-largest.

1186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Sells $12 Billion of Bonds in Unprecedented Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia took its first major step onto the global financial stage to fund the heady ambitions of its crown prince, issuing $12 billion of bonds for its state-run oil company in one of the most oversubscribed debt offerings in history.
The demand for Saudi Aramco’s debut offering was so robust it allowed the energy giant to borrow at a lower yield than its sovereign parent. That’s a rarity in the debt world and underscores the global chase for yield that has investors brushing off long-held conventions. The rush to buy Aramco’s debt even helped to drag down the borrowing costs of the kingdom.
The bond sale raises money to finance Saudi Arabia’s economic agenda after an initial public offering of Aramco was postponed last year until at least 2021. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the country day-to-day, is using the state oil producer’s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions for the economy.
The success of the deal has also been seen as essential for some of the world’s biggest banks, who took Aramco and officials from the Saudi government -- a wildly lucrative client -- on a worldwide roadshow last week pitching the bonds from Boston to Singapore. Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., touted the deal at a lunch in New York.
The red-carpet treatment stood in sharp contrast to the reception many financial leaders gave the kingdom a year ago, when banking executives including Dimon skipped a high-profile summit in Riyadh following the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S. has blacklisted 16 Saudi nationals for their role in the murder of Khashoggi, a former Saudi insider-turned-critic who had moved to the U.S.
JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) managed the bond sale along with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), and NCB Capital Co.
During its worldwide roadshows, investors were showered with financial data and operational secrets of the kingdom’s most important asset, information that had been held closely since the company’s nationalization in the late 1970s.
The disclosures gave investors plenty of reasons to jump on the deal. With $111.1 billion of profit in 2018, Aramco ranks as the most profitable company in the world. Moody’s Investors Service likened it to a AAA rated corporation, with low debt relative to its cash flow and access to one of the world’s largest hydrocarbon reserves.
“There’s no debating how strong of an entity this is when looking at its assets and cash flow generation,” said Bob Summers, an investment-grade portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in Chicago.
Investor orders for the five-part deal exceeded $100 billion at the peak on Tuesday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A $3 billion, 10-year bond, for example, priced to yield 105 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, 12.5 basis points less than what investors demand to own similar-maturity debt of the Saudi government, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing the private deal.
Aramco received the strongest demand for longer-dated, highest-yielding bonds, which are effectively a bet on Saudi Arabia and oil around the year 2050. Longer-dated bonds are usually popular with pension funds and insurance companies seeking to match the duration of their assets and liabilities.
While other corporate-bond sales have generated $100 billion-plus of orders -- including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)., Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). -- those companies targeted a substantially larger amount of debt. The final order book came in at $92 billion as Aramco dropped a planned floating-rate note and some requests were pared back.
It wasn’t the first time Saudi Arabia turned to debt markets since Khashoggi’s killing. In January, the nation sold $7.5 billion in international bonds, showing that the outcry hasn’t stifled foreign investment in the country.
The deal had plenty of other things going for it. Investors love to get access to marquee first-time issuers, particularly those with such closely guarded secrets. That also allows fund managers to diversify their investment base. Managers that tie their performance to indexes also would need to get a piece.
“It’s going to be an important component of a lot of the different indices. So if you’re index sensitive, you can’t avoid it,” Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Boston-based fund manager Loomis Sayles & Co., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Moody’s and other credit raters tempered their enthusiasm, though, rating it in line with the Saudi government with the fifth-highest investment-grade ranking.
“That offering is as pricey as I’ve seen in quite a while,” said Loomis’s Fuss. “When bonds are oversubscribed, it’s really a good idea not to be one of the subscribers.”"
1187,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>","Stock Pickers Love ETFs That Hide Assets, But Investors May Not","(Bloomberg) -- After more than four years of waiting, active managers may soon be able to start exchange-traded funds without giving away their investing secrets -- but it may be too little, too late to rejuvenate the industry.
In a milestone decision, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday that it plans to approve a special kind of ETF that partially conceals its holdings, unlike a normal fund that reports them daily. Proponents view the structure -- created by Precidian Funds -- as a way for stock pickers to get in on the ETF game and fight back against the shift to indexed products.
That said, it isn’t clear there’s much investor demand for ETFs with reduced disclosure.
“The interest has been far greater among asset managers than it has been among investors,” said Ben Johnson, who heads passive strategy research at Morningstar Inc. “More fundamentally it’s an asset management problem they’re looking to solve, with concerns around transparency.”
Active managers have been under competitive pressure from passive products like ETFs for years. Stock pickers have largely watched as the funds grew into a $3.8 trillion industry, unwilling to start an ETF that would reveal their holdings and allow competitors to guess their strategy and possibly front-run their trades.
Now that they’ll soon be relieved of that problem, a larger issue related to fees remains: Paying more for active funds is increasingly unappealing to investors who saw two-thirds of such equity mutual funds trail their benchmarks in March.
Large asset managers who will pay to license Precidian’s ActiveShares technology include BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Capital Group Cos., according to Precidian.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects the first funds to start trading within about six months.
“What we’re doing now is leveling the playing field for the active manager who can provide alpha, and allow him to bring his wares to market” said Dan McCabe, chief executive officer of Precidian.
But investors may not be eager customers given reservations about products with limited disclosure.  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp. began selling non-transparent ETFs back in 2016. These funds, which function differently from Precidian’s model, have been slow to gather assets. A number of other structures are also seeking approval.
The broader effects and potential risks of limited-disclosure funds is still unknown, according to Ty Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets, a money manager advocacy group.
“This comes as the SEC and regulators around the world are already exploring the risks or potential for ETFs to exacerbate or transmit systemic risk, as well as potential conflicts of interest in ETF administration,” Gellasch said. “What happens in times of stress, and will that be different if investors don’t know what’s in the ETF?”"
1188,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>","Costco Is a Strong Company, but Stock Looks Overbought","By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - Numbers suggest Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) stock is overbought.
Even with Tuesday's 0.8% dip, the stock is selling at 32x trailing 12-month earnings.
The technical indicators on Investing.com rate the stock a sell. The consensus one-year target price for the stock is $241.35 and that's lower than the current price.
Of 30 analysts tracked by Investing.com, 18 rate the stock a buy and the rest are neutral.
And it has had a terrific run-up since the Christmas slump, rising 30% from its Dec. 26 low to a 52-week high of $247.09 on Monday.
All that said, Costco has a long record of growing its business ($142 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018), growing it profitably and growing it with a well-paid workforce who buy the stock and tend to stay at the company for a long time.
Costco, with its big warehouses filled with a somewhat limited selection, is nonetheless the world's largest seller of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chickens and wine.
Its auto-buying program, where it matches buyers with local dealers who agree to limit their markups, resulted in 650,000 sales in 2018, up 25% from a year earlier. If Costco were an auto dealer, it would be one of the largest.
Prices are low in part because Costco has a built-in profit center in the annual membership fees it charges customers, who typically renew every year.
As of March, the Issaquah, Wash.-based company operated 770 warehouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, Japan and South Korea.
And shareholders have done well, with a return of more than 14% a year - plus dividends - since the end of 2014.
When to get into Costco requires good timing because when Costco falls, it falls heavily. It dropped 42% in the turmoil in the year or so after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks; 49% in 2008-2009, the heart of the financial crisis; and nearly 23% from its top in September to the post-Christmas bottom.
The last pullback was triggered in part because its first-quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street estimates. But the shares recovered nicely in March after its second-quarter earnings beat estimates. Some of the volatility may be due to the share ownership. Institutions own more than 73% of the stock.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect $1.82 in earnings for the third quarter on revenue of $34.6 billion, compared with $1.70 a share and sales of $32.4 billion a year ago. Earnings are due May 31."
1189,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:07PM ET</span>",Boeing records zero new MAX orders following global groundings,"By Rachit Vats and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's orders and deliveries sank in the first quarter, with zero new orders for the 737 MAX following a worldwide grounding in March in the wake of two fatal plane crashes.
The groundings forced Boeing to freeze deliveries of the MAX, which had been its fastest-selling jetliner until a March 10 crash on Ethiopian Airlines that killed all 157 onboard, just five months after a similar crash on Lion Air that killed all 189 passengers and crew.
Total orders, an indication of future demand, fell to 95 aircraft in the first quarter from 180 a year earlier, suggesting a wait-and-watch approach for airlines as Boeing rides out the worst crisis in its history.
Still, Boeing is ahead of its European rival Airbus, which last week said it had won 62 gross orders during the first three months of 2019 but some 120 cancellations left it with a negative net order. 
Chicago-based Boeing's first-quarter 737 deliveries tumbled about 33 percent, pushing total aircraft deliveries down 19 percent to 149 from a year earlier. Boeing delivered just 11 MAX in March before the suspension.
Deliveries are financially important because that is when planemakers receive the bulk of money from airlines' purchases.
It is still unclear when the MAX jets will fly again, with global regulators including China saying they would join a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration panel to review the aircraft's safety.
""A fix and removal of the grounding prior to September 2019 could be perceived positively,"" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said, noting that fresh scrutiny of the certification process could potentially filter into Boeing's 777X program.
Boeing's shares, which have lost about 13% since the crash, were down 1.66 percent at $368.32 in afternoon trading.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it does not expect Boeing to deliver any MAXs in the second quarter and said it was difficult to expect MAX orders at the upcoming Paris Air Show in June.
The latest variant of Boeing's 737 family, which makes up the bulk of its narrowbody production, has been viewed as the likely workhorse for global airlines for decades and central to Boeing's long-running battle against Airbus.
Boeing said last week it would cut monthly 737 MAX production by 20 percent starting mid-April, without giving an end-date.
The company had been ramping up MAX deliveries before the grounding, with the planes accounting for nearly half of its deliveries in the last few months.

There were more than 300 MAX jetliners in operation at the time of the fatal Lion Air crash last October, and about 4,600 more on order.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 02:45PM ET</span>",Pandora seeks to charm China with locally-inspired jewelry,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish jeweler Pandora is turning to traditional Chinese symbols such as peach blossom in a new collection aimed at reviving its fortunes in the world's biggest market for luxury brands. 
The collection, to be launched on Wednesday, is the first from the world's largest jewelry maker to be tailored to a specific market and could be a test for customizing future ranges, Kenneth Madsen, head of Pandora's Asia-Pacific region, told Reuters. 
Success in China is crucial to Pandora as it tries to regain its footing after a decade of dramatic sales growth came to an abrupt halt last year, lopping more than half off its market value and leading to the ousting of its chief executive.
While mall shopping in big markets such as the United States and Britain is declining, China saw spending on luxury goods surge 20 percent last year, driven by a growing middle class. 
But some global brands have struggled to take advantage.
Pandora reported a drop in sales at established Chinese stores last year, and has pledged to take steps to improve its performance, such as lowering retail prices in the country by an average of 15 percent to try to curb sales on the grey market.
Madsen said the new collection was part of the revamp.
""The Chinese love global brands, but they appreciate the local relevance and that a brand shows a commitment to China through specific designs,"" he said in an interview, referring to the new collection's focus on features such as the peach blossom flower - a symbol of love and fortune in Chinese culture. 
Pandora, best known for its customizable charm bracelets, will follow up Wednesday's launch with a big marketing push, exhibiting the new collection in all 210 of its shops in China, as well as in around 40 in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.
It will also advertise the range on social media, such as the popular T-mall shopping platform and in a WeChat pop-up store, and via other promotional events in big cities.
Consultants Bain & Company said in a recent report that global luxury brands losing market share in China often fail to interact with millennials on social media platforms.
""The challenge in China is that it's all developing at an incredible speed,"" Madsen said. ""It's hard for us to keep up."" 
Madsen expects the collection to represent a ""significant share"" of Pandora's Chinese sales this year. Last year, China accounted for about 10 percent of overall sales of 22.8 billion Danish crowns ($3.44 billion).
Luxury spending by Chinese shoppers both at home and abroad represent one-third of the global market, but an increasing share is spent at home, according to Bain.

Chinese jewelry sales stood at 697 billion yuan ($104 billion) last year and are forecast to grow to 852 billion yuan in 2023, according to Euromonitor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday as tariff tensions between the United States and its European trading partners went from simmer to boil and the IMF cut its global growth outlook.
All three major stock indexes were in the red, with the S&P 500 poised to snap its eight-day rally.
President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on $11 billion of European goods, raising tensions over aircraft subsidies that threaten to morph into a wider trade war.
Trade disputes, along with a potentially messy Brexit, led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut its global economic growth forecasts and warn that further cuts could be in the offing.
""Today is essentially a headline reaction to new tariffs being proposed and the downward revisions by the IMF,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton.
But Baumohl pointed out that U.S. stocks have rallied this year, even though economic downturn jitters and tariff concerns have been on the horizon for some time, and with lowered first quarter earnings expectations. 
""We would expect that to be reflected in stock prices,"" Baumohl added. ""It raises an interesting question as to whether there's an asset bubble forming."" 
The reporting period for first-quarter earnings is set to begin in earnest, with Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co results due later in the week, kicking off what analysts now expect to be the first quarter to show a year-on-year decline in earnings since 2016.
January-March profits for S&P 500 companies are now seen falling by 2.5% from last year, according to Refinitiv data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 196.64 points, or 0.75%, to 26,144.38, the S&P 500 lost 18.1 points, or 0.63%, to 2,877.67 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.70 points, or 0.51%, to 7,913.18.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co extended its losses after reporting a drop in deliveries related to its grounded 737 MAX jets. Its shares were down 1.7%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc has agreed to pay $1.1 billion to U.S. and British authorities for conducting illegal financial transactions that violated sanctions against Iran and other countries, government authorities announced on Tuesday.
The settlement by the London-based bank is among the most severe imposed for sanctions violations, some of which occurred not long after Standard Chartered settled similar charges in 2012.
""The circumstances that led to today's resolutions are completely unacceptable"" and ""not representative"" of the bank today, Group Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement.
Tuesday's settlement extends by two years a deferred prosecution agreement that Standard Chartered originally entered in 2012.
A former Standard Chartered banker in Dubai pleaded guilty in a New York state court to sanctions-related violations, authorities also said, while an Iranian customer was criminally charged by federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C.
Standard Chartered ""undermined the integrity of our financial system and harmed our national security by deliberately providing Iranians with coveted access to the U.S. economy,"" Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu said.
The agreements resolve an investigation that began into Standard Chartered's banking for Iran-controlled entities in the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The investigation began roughly five years ago. 
The bank paid U.S. authorities $667 million in 2012 for illegally moving millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of customers in Iran, Sudan, Libya and Myanmar, some of the same countries involved in the latest settlement. 
In 2014, it paid another $300 million to the New York's Department of Financial Services after a monitor uncovered shortcomings in the bank's surveillance systems.
In a statement on Tuesday, Standard Chartered said it accepted responsibility for the violations, which stopped after 2014. The bank also said it had cooperated in the investigations.
The latest penalty is a tally of fines and forfeitures imposed by U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
The FCA imposed a 102 million pound fine ($134 million) on the bank for its control failures. It noted Standard Chartered's lax controls in opening an account with 3 million UAE Dirham in cash in a suitcase (just over 500,000 pounds), and allowing a customer to export a product with potential military applications to war zones.
New York's DFS said the misconduct involved $600 million in illegal dollar transactions between 2008 and 2014 that moved through the state from the bank's London and Dubai offices.
Another $20 million in U.S. dollar payments were tied to illegal transactions involving Syrian, Sudanese, Burmese and Cuban entities, the New York regulator said.
After bank employees found that dozens of clients used an internet platform to access U.S. dollar accounts from Iran, bank compliance officers failed to take steps to ensure the transactions were blocked, New York’s regulator said.
Payments from Iran through a fax in the Dubai branch also were not halted, and a manager told an Iranian front company how to evade detection by changing its name and opening a new account, the regulator said.
New York will ensure ""the bank lives up to its word and maintains effective safeguards,"" said Acting New York Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell. As part of its deal, an independent consultant will continue to oversee the bank's remediation efforts, the regulator said.
Standard Chartered also agreed to enter into amended deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. Justice Department and the Manhattan District Attorney for conspiring to violate sanctions and falsifying New York business records. The agreements now run through April 2021. 
The bank had been operating under a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities since the 2012 settlement.
The agreement has been extended numerous times, most recently for 10 days and set to expire on Wednesday. 
Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900 million for the potential resolution of violations of U.S. sanctions and foreign exchange trading. That sum also included the FCA penalty. 
Standard Chartered's penalty is well below the $8.9 billion imposed by U.S. authorities in 2014 on  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) for conspiring to evade sanctions. The 10 banks penalized for similar conduct over the past decade also include France's  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), which paid $787 million in 2015, and Amsterdam-based ING Bank, $619 million in 2012.

Reuters broke the news of the latest settlement on Monday and exclusively reported on the probe in 2014.

For full-year 2019, Pentair (NYSE:PNR) said that it expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.30 to $2.35, below prior guidance of $2.50 to $2.60. Full-year sales, meanwhile, are expected to increase about 1% to 2% on a reported basis, down from previous sales guidance for an increase of about 5% to 6%.
Its shares fell more than 14%.
Pentair reported preliminary first-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.43 per share, missing its prior forecast for earnings in a range of $0.52 to $0.55 per share. Revenue for the quarter slumped 6%, well below the previous estimate of flat to up 1%.
""Our first quarter was significantly impacted by the adverse cold and wet weather in our higher margin aquatics and ag-related businesses,"" Pentair CEO John L. Stauch said.
The company also highlighted moderating growth in several of its end markets and higher-than-expected inventory levels in some of its key distribution channels as headwinds in the quarter weighed on growth.
""Due to seasonality in PNR's major end markets, it is unlikely the company can fully recoup from Q1 headwinds in 2019, but we expect a return to normal growth in 2020,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.

Pentair will report full first-quarter results on April 17."
1195,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",More than 100 dismissed in Airbus compliance crackdown: sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus dismissed more than 100 people and issued more than 300 warnings for ethics or compliance reasons in 2018, two people familiar with the company data said, as it conducts a wide-ranging internal crackdown and deals with outside fraud probes.
The aerospace group is being investigated by UK and French authorities over suspected corruption dating back over a decade and is in the fifth year of a sweeping internal probe designed to improve its chances of winning favorable settlements.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the figures or give annual comparisons. The dismissals coincided with a sharp increase in the use of an internal whistleblower system, providing a guide to the trend on compliance issues.
Complaints handled by the system almost doubled last year and mostly involved matters covered by ordinary employment law.
The service also handled close to 40 allegations of fraud and half a dozen accusations of bribery. More than 10 of the reported cases involved suspected breaches of export controls, the two people said. Airbus declined to comment.
The company, which employs around 130,000 people worldwide, is under investigation in the United States over suspected violations of export controls and U.S. officials have also kept a close watch on the European bribery probes.
The figures emerged on the eve of a shareholder meeting as some investors worry about Airbus's exposure to potential fines, which analysts say could run to several billion dollars.
""Airbus shareholders are still waiting for a full disclosure on the allegations of bribery and corruption cases of the past. For the future, Airbus (has) enhanced compliance standards to prevent further incidents and the company seems to be on the right track,"" Frankfurt-based fund manager DWS said.
Chief Executive Tom Enders has said Airbus has had to handle management turnover at the same time as a wave of scheduled retirements and acknowledged 2018 had been tough.
""I am today much more optimistic about the company managing these difficult issues than frankly I would have been a year ago,"" he told a Feb. 14 news conference.
LAWYER FEES
Airbus is spending more than 100 million euros ($113 million) a year on lawyers to investigate staff to help win a prosecution settlement in Britain and France over the fraud allegations resulting from a system of middlemen it says it abandoned in 2014. It was not clear how many of the dismissals resulted from this drive.
A British judge said in 2017 that companies must present a radically new face and significant co-operation in rooting out their own violations to win a settlement and avoid charges.
The internal probe has led to growing complaints among staff of a witch hunt, people who deal with the company say. Help lines handled around 80 cases of alleged moral harassment, the company data shows.
Industry sources say the internal probe has had a dampening effect on Airbus sales, which slumped last year. Several executives are expected to join a wave of senior departures despite not facing specific accusations, the people said.
Airbus declined to comment.
Staff malaise turned to anger when it was reported last week that Enders retires on Wednesday with a total retirement package of almost 40 million euros over 20 years. 
Enders and other individuals are under investigation over the sale of fighters to Austria and has denied wrongdoing.
The Airbus spokesman defended the pension package, which is expected to be raised at an annual meeting on Wednesday.  
""There is no golden, silver or bronze parachute. These are contractual obligations that were agreed many years ago.""

Enders is credited with unifying a once fragmented company and improving governance but leaves amid disagreement over his strategy for handling the compliance campaign.

1196,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Ford CEO Tamps Down Expectations for First Autonomous Vehicles,"(Bloomberg) -- Too much hype has built up about how soon self-driving cars will hit the road, but they will ultimately change the world, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s chief executive officer said.
“We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,” Jim Hackett said Tuesday at a Detroit Economic Club event. While Ford’s first self-driving car is still coming in 2021, “its applications will be narrow, what we call geo-fenced, because the problem is so complex.”
Hackett, 63, is engineering an $11 billion overhaul of Ford, which involves closing factories, cutting thousands of salaried jobs and ditching tradition sedans to focus on high profit sport-utility vehicles and trucks. In addition to shoring up profitability, the drastic moves are borne out of the pressure car companies are under to get autonomous-vehicle technology on the road before rivals inside and outside the auto industry.
“When we break through, it will change the way your toothpaste is delivered,” Hackett said at Ford Field, the football stadium of the Detroit Lions, owned by the family of Executive Chairman Bill Ford. “Logistics and ride structures and cities all get redesigned. I won’t be in charge of Ford when this is going on, but I see it clearly.”
Ford recently earned kudos from President Donald Trump for investing $900 million to build electric and self-driving cars in Michigan and $1 billion on two factories in Chicago to build Explorer SUVs. Hackett also is in talks with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG to jointly develop electric vehicles and driverless cars. The two automakers already have joined forces to build commercial vans and trucks.
“When we bring this thing to market, it’s going to be really powerful,” Hackett said. “There’s probably going to be alliance partners that we haven’t announced yet that will make it more certain that we don’t take on all the risks ourselves financially.”"

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Berlin reveals contacts with Deutsche Bank amid merger talks,"By John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's Chief Executive had a series of meetings with Germany's deputy finance minister before and immediately after it announced merger talks with a state-backed rival, according to information revealed by the government.
The contact underscores the attention Germany's finance ministry has given to the country's largest bank at a critical juncture that will determine whether the state becomes a shareholder in the group.
In a letter answering a question from a German lawmaker, seen by Reuters, the government said Deutsche CEO Christian Sewing had met three times this year with Germany's deputy finance minister, Joerg Kukies.
Two of those meetings happened in January, while the third was on March 18, the day after Deutsche and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) publicly confirmed they were in talks about a possible merger.
Fabio De Masi, the leftist lawmaker who made the information request, said the meetings showed finance minister Olaf Scholz, and his deputy, had been important in influencing talks, even though they have sought to distance themselves.
""In reality, Scholz and Kukies hold the key,"" he said, adding a merger would be a risk for taxpayers and cost thousands of jobs. ""A banking champion is a dangerous idea. Putting two turkeys together won't produce an eagle."" 
A spokesman for the finance ministry said Kukies meets ""with many representatives of banks ... on numerous occasions"" because of his job, and declined to comment on the merger talks.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank's exploratory talks with Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany's finance ministry, which is worried about the future of the country's biggest bank.
Any deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group, which one German official said would need up to 10 billion euros ($11 billion) of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact losses on investments could be triggered. 
Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group, playing a central role in any fusion. Lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank later runs into trouble.

Berlin could yet pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>","In new attack, Trump threatens more tariffs against European Union","By Philip Blenkinsop, Tim Hepher and Susan Heavey
BRUSSELS/PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose U.S. tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, heightening tensions over a long-running transatlantic aircraft subsidy dispute and opening a new front in his global trade war.
The United States and Europe have been locked in a years-long spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants, Netherlands-based Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, to help them gain advantage in the world jet business.
The case, which has been grinding its way through the World Trade Organization for almost 15 years, is approaching the final stages of arbitration.
""The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!"" Trump said on Twitter. ""The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!"" 
Trump's public attack on the EU came even as his administration has yet to hammer out trade deals with China and neighbors Mexico and Canada.
A day earlier, the U.S. Trade Representative proposed targeting a list of EU products for tariffs, ranging from large commercial aircraft to dairy products and wine, as retaliation for European aircraft subsidies. The final list is expected this summer.
In response, the European Commission said earlier Tuesday it had started to draw up plans to retaliate over Boeing subsidies.
""The Commission is starting preparations so that the EU can promptly take action based on the arbitrator's decision on retaliation rights in this case,"" a Commission spokesman said. ""The European Union remains open for discussions with the United States, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome.""
Both sides have won partial victories in claiming Airbus and Boeing received unlawful subsidies but disagree on the amount involved and whether each has complied with earlier WTO rulings.
Airbus said it saw no legal basis for the U.S. move and warned of deepening transatlantic trade tensions.
The EU is already facing U.S. tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports and Trump has repeatedly threatened to hit EU cars with punitive duties.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Paris that the two sides needed to reach a friendly agreement.
""When I see the situation global growth is in, I don't think we can afford to have a trade conflict, even if only on the specific issues of the aircraft industry in the United States and Europe,"" he said. 
'MORE TIT-FOR-TAT'
The U.S. tariffs proposal put pressure on shares in European makers of aircraft and aerospace suppliers, wine, cheese and luxury goods.
Airbus shares closed down nearly 2 percent, while Boeing dropped 1.4 percent. Airbus suppliers such as  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA and Leonardo SpA also closed lower. 
Analysts were divided over whether the ramped-up dispute would lead to greater global trade issues. 
""Get ready for more tit-for-tat scrapping to follow,"" said John Woolfitt of London brokerage Atlantic Markets.
Germany is particularly apprehensive of possible U.S. tariffs on car imports. The United States is a major market for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Mercedes maker Daimler and BMW.
Moody's said on Tuesday that potential U.S. tariffs on imported autos and parts represented a significant risk to global growth and would hinder economic momentum in Germany, Japan and Korea.
"" ... The U.S. wants to pressure the EU to engage in meaningful trade talks, but without having to apply the more painful measure of automotive tariffs,” said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Fabiana Fedeli at Robeco sees the latest moves as tactical.

""The new tariffs ... are a drop in the ocean as a percentage of the overall trade between the U.S. and Europe and we view them as a negotiating tool to set the tone for what the really important negotiations are, namely autos,"" she said.

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:42PM ET</span>","American trims quarterly revenue forecast on grounded jets, total cost unknown","By Rachit Vats and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc on Tuesday trimmed its first-quarter revenue forecast after cancelling more than 2,000 flights due to the global grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets and problems with overhead bins in cabins of another Boeing jet that the airline was retrofitting.
American said it was too early to project the total cost of the suspended operations of the 737 MAX in the wake of two deadly crashes. The No. 1 U.S. carrier owns 24 of the brand-new  Boeing Co  aircraft whose use was suspended around the world in March.
The MAX grounding caused 1,200 American flight cancellations during the first quarter, in addition to 940 cancellations due to American's decision to remove 14 737-800 aircraft from service after pilots complained that overhead bins were not closing on some recently retrofitted cabins. 
As a result, American said it now expects https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000000620119000014/a8kinvestorupdateex991q1-19.htm revenue per available seat mile, a closely followed measure of performance, to be flat to up 1 percent compared with the prior forecast of flat to 2 percent growth.
American said all its 737-800 aircraft will be back in service by the end of April, but the carrier will continue to cancel about 90 flights per day through June 5 as the 737 MAX remains grounded.
Because it is still unclear when the MAX jets will begin flying again, American said it cannot yet forecast the cost of the disruption beyond the first quarter.
American has 76 more MAX jets on order, though deliveries are on hold as Boeing works through a software fix, which will need regulatory approval. 
Shares in American, which have risen about 5.5 percent so far this year, were down 2.1 percent at $33.175 in midday trading, off a session low of $32.60.
American cut its first-quarter outlook for margins, citing higher fuel prices. Excluding special items, the company now expects pre-tax margin to be about 2 percent to 4 percent, compared with its prior forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent.
Yet analysts said they were encouraged by the carrier's passenger revenue performance considering the quarter's headwinds, which also included the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown.
Smaller rival Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southwest-outlook/southwest-trims-first-quarter-outlook-after-737-max-groundings-idUSKCN1R810K was the first U.S. airline to formally cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service. 

United Airlines, which owns 14 MAX but has managed to avoid cancellations by using larger aircraft on those routes, said on Tuesday the strategy was costing it money and could not continue forever.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>",German wind turbine maker Senvion files for insolvency,"By Alexander Hübner and Michelle Martin
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German court on Tuesday approved an application for insolvency from wind turbine manufacturer Senvion, although the company said it was also continuing to look at new funding options and various potential investors had shown interest.
The Hamburg-based company, which has more than a billion euros of debt, said it had applied for preliminary self-administration proceedings because refinancing discussions with lenders had not yet been successful. 
Shares in Senvion were down 40.5 percent at 1519 GMT, having fallen as much as 55 percent earlier in the day.
Senvion has faced delays and penalties related to big projects, while the wind industry as a whole has seen falling prices and increased competition as it moves away from governments guaranteeing generous fixed subsidized tariffs for power toward an auction-based system that favors the lowest bidders.
Market leaders Siemens Gamesa and Vestas have more pricing power, putting smaller suppliers under pressure. 
Financial sources had told Reuters Senvion needed at least 100 million euros ($112 million) in the short term to keep operating. 
""Lenders and major bond holders are currently continuing intensive discussions around a financing offer to secure the continuation of operations which may allow the company to successfully exit this process,"" Senvion said in a statement.
Two financial sources said hedge funds Anchorage and Davidson Kempner were prepared to put up the 100 million euros in loans that CEO Yves Rannou - who took the helm in January - needs to continue restructuring and clear the backlog of orders that has recently cost the company revenues and profit.
The sources said majority shareholder Centerbridge was prepared to accept that but the banks - notably  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and BayernLB - would still need to agree. The banks have lent Senvion a total of 950 million euros.
BayernLB and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Senvion also has 400 million euros in bonds bought by hedge funds including Anchorage and Davidson Kempner.
Senvion said its management board would remain in office under the initiated procedure and business operations would carry on, with both existing service and maintenance contracts continuing.
The company said the preliminary self-administration proceedings affected Senvion GmbH and a subsidiary called Senvion Deutschland GmbH. It said Senvion S.A., Senvion Topco GmbH and Senvion Holding GmbH were expected to file for insolvency later this week.
Senvion's website says it has around 4,000 employees globally.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Long-outlawed U.S. trade policy wins WTO approval in Canada lumber dispute,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization ruling approved a long-outlawed U.S. trade policy on Tuesday, when a panel of adjudicators said Washington's use of ""zeroing"" to calculate anti-dumping tariffs was permissible in the case of Canadian softwood lumber. 
The WTO's long-running row over zeroing is a technical dispute that turned into a power struggle between the United States and the arbiters of international trade law.
The United States has suffered a string of defeats at the WTO over zeroing, a calculation method that was ruled to have unfairly increased the level of U.S. anti-dumping duties. 
The repeated losses helped to fuel U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to reform the WTO, where the United States is blocking appointments at the WTO's Appellate Body, effectively the supreme court of world trade.
Trump said last year the United States could withdraw from the WTO if ""they don't shape up"". 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer welcomed the ruling by a WTO dispute panel, which he said showed the ""erroneous"", ""unpersuasive"" and ""flawed reasoning"" of Appellate Body rulings in the past. 
""The United States commends this panel for doing its own interpretive analysis, and for having the courage to stand up to the undue pressure that the Appellate Body has been putting on panels for many years,"" Lighthizer said in a statement.
He said the WTO rules did not prohibit zeroing, and the United States would never have signed up to WTO rules that did prohibit the practice. 
""WTO Appellate Body reports to the contrary are wrong, and reflect over-reaching by that body,"" he said. 
Canada launched the WTO dispute in November 2017, saying it would forcefully defend its lumber industry against ""unfair, unwarranted and deeply troubling"" U.S. tariffs.
The U.S. Commerce Department had accused Canada of unfairly subsidizing and dumping softwood lumber, which is commonly used in the construction of homes. Its duties affected about $5.66 billion worth of imports.

There was no immediate reaction from Canada’s international trade ministry, which could appeal against the ruling.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Several Deutsche Bank exchange-traded-notes to cease trading Thursday,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A dozen of Deutsche Bank's exchange-traded notes that provide exposure to oil, metals and other commodities are set to stop trading on Thursday, according to a recent filing by the bank.
Exchange-traded notes, including the DB FI Enhanced Global High Yield ETN, the DB Crude Oil Long ETN and the Elements Dogs of the DOW Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return ETN, will be delisted at the close of trading on Thursday, according to an April 2 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
ETNs are issued by a bank and are similar to exchange-traded funds in that they trade on stock exchanges and track benchmark indexes. But they differ from ETFs in that they are debt instruments with a set maturity date and expose investors to the issuer's credit risk.
The  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) ETNs being delisted are relatively small, with assets under management ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a few million dollars, with most set to mature in 2038.
When ETNs stop trading publicly, they leave investors who hold them to find a buyer “over-the-counter,” where investors are not guaranteed anything close to what the notes are worth. 
After the delisting, the secondary market for these ETNs may experience a significant drop in liquidity, Deutsche Bank warned in a statement in March.
Banks, under regulatory pressure to cut risk since the financial crisis, have been issuing fewer ETNs and delisting existing ones to focus on their core businesses.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>","Fund sues Venezuela for $26 million in unpaid bonds, interest","CARACAS (Reuters) - Global fund manager Pharo has sued Venezuela for $26 million in unpaid bond principal and interest, a U.S. court filing showed, as legal claims by creditors piled up against the OPEC nation whose economy is suffering from a hyperinflationary collapse.
In a complaint filed with the New York State Supreme Court late on Monday, Pharo said two funds that it controls own $1.5 million in bonds that matured in 2018 and more than $200 million in bonds set to mature in October 2019. Venezuela failed to pay interest and principal on the 2018 bonds and missed three interest payments on the 2019 bonds, it added.
Pharo manages around $10 billion from offices in London, New York and Hong Kong, according to its website. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The government of President Nicolas Maduro stopped making payments on nearly all bonds issued by the South American country and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela last year, and has accumulated some $8 billion in pending interest and principal.
Investors had taken few concrete actions in response to the default until last December, when a group of creditors demanded payment on a $1.5 billion bond, though they did not take the claim to court. Later that month, a little-known Florida firm sued Venezuela for $34 million in defaulted bonds.
A group of bondholders in January said they would not negotiate a potential restructuring of debt with Maduro, saying the opposition-controlled National Assembly was the country's ""only legitimately elected body."" Western countries and the domestic opposition deride Maduro's 2018 reelection as a sham, while Maduro, a socialist, argues Venezuela is the victim of a U.S.-led ""economic war.""
Maduro in 2017 invited creditors to a brief meeting in Caracas to discuss a potential debt renegotiation, but no agreement was reached, and sanctions placed on Venezuela by the United States will complicate any effort to reach an agreement.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ford likely to end independent India business with new Mahindra deal - sources,"By Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is nearing a deal with Mahindra & Mahindra to form a new joint-venture company in India, a move that will likely see the U.S. automaker cease independent operations in the country, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
The deal would make Ford the latest automaker to pare back its interests in India. At the end of 2017, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) downsized its Indian operations and stopped selling cars locally, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing.
Over two decades, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford invested more than $2 billion in India but has consistently struggled - it currently has a market share of just 3 percent in India, one of the world's fastest-growing car markets.
Under the terms of the deal being negotiated, Ford will form a new unit in India in which it will hold a 49 percent stake, while Mahindra will own 51 percent, the two sources said.
The U.S. carmaker's Indian unit will transfer most of its current automotive business to the new entity, including its assets and employees, according to one of the sources. 
""It's like a partial exit (for Ford from India),"" the source said.
The deal is expected to close within 90 days, the sources said, adding the value of the transaction was not yet clear. 
They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Ford said it does not comment on speculation, but added both companies continue to work together ""to develop avenues of strategic cooperation that help us achieve commercial, manufacturing and business efficiencies"".
Mahindra too said it does not comment on speculation. It said in a statement it was ""working together in identified areas"" with Ford after a 2017 partnership arrangement, and ""will announce further definitive agreements as we progress on some of the other areas."" 
Currently, Ford manufactures and sells its cars in India through its wholly-owned subsidiary. In 2017, it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they will build new cars together, including sport-utility vehicles and electric variants.
Ford has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years. Last month, its Russian joint venture said it would close two assembly plants and an engine factory in Russia, exiting the country's passenger vehicle market.
TOUGH MARKET
India has been a major growth area for global car manufacturers but growth has slowed of late - car sales grew by 3 percent to just over 3.3 million units in the last fiscal year to March 31, compared with 8 percent the previous year.
Even so, India is set to become the world's third-largest car market by 2023 with sales of over 5 million cars annually, according to forecasting firm IHS Markit.
Ford's decision is a stark reminder of how most foreign automakers have struggled to make major inroads in India, a market dominated by players such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co.
Ford sold close to 93,000 vehicles in India last fiscal year, a far cry from market leader Maruti Suzuki which commands a 51 percent market share and sold more than 1.7 million cars.
Automakers such as Maruti benefit in India from their vast dealership network and an autonomous local team that can quickly react to market changes.
One of the sources said the Ford-Mahindra deal would lead to more affordable Ford cars in the country, as the company would not need to pay any royalty to its global parent, as the Indian unit has to now.
The funds that accrue to Ford's India unit because of the deal will also be used to clear some of its accumulated losses, the two sources said.
Puneet Gupta, associate director at IHS Markit, said the deal would help Ford and Mahindra launch new models at a faster pace and lower development cost, which is critical to success in a price sensitive market like India.

""It's a win-win situation for both,"" Gupta said.

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",The downfall of Jet Airways: How India's premium airline crumbled,"By Anshuman Daga and Aditi Shah
SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In early January, Jet Airways and its main lender, State Bank of India, met with aircraft lessors to assure them there was a plan to rescue the debt-laden carrier so it could pay them, sources familiar with the matter said.
The idea was to shore up confidence in one of India's biggest brands, squeezed by low fares and high costs. But some lessors quickly lost patience as the bank did not provide details and Jet's founder angrily defied them to take back planes.
At one point, the airline's usually jovial founder and chairman, Naresh Goyal, banged his fist on a table, jarring some of the lessors who had flown to Mumbai from Dublin, Singapore and Dubai, said one person who attended the discussions. ""That meeting went horribly wrong,"" recalled the executive from a global leasing firm, who did not want to identified because the meeting was not public.
Goyal's emotional outburst and Jet's subsequent failure to pay up as promised may have pushed the relationship between the airline and its lessors to a breaking point, two other executives who were at the meeting said, prompting some to take the drastic step of pulling their planes from its fleet.
That has led Jet, which blazed trails in one of the world's fastest-growing air travel markets, to cancel hundreds of flights. Saddled with more than $1.2 billion in debt, and with dwindling revenue, the airline has said it also owes money to banks, pilots and suppliers.
It was not immediately clear how much money Jet owes.
Jet did not respond to multiple requests for comment but has said it is ""actively engaged"" with all its lessors. Goyal did not respond to requests for comment.
""Aircraft lessors have been supportive of the company's efforts in this regard,"" Jet said in its most recent statement to the Mumbai stock exchange on April 2.
The loss of aircraft and friction with lessors is just the latest major setback for Jet, which has been struggling for years, beset by an insurgent group of low-cost Indian competitors.
Purchases of wide-body aircraft 13 years ago and ambitions for the international market may have set Jet on its current course, industry insiders say.
The 26-year-old airline has posted losses in eight of the past 10 years and its share of the domestic passenger market has fallen to about 15.5 percent in 2018 from 22.5 percent in 2015.
About 60 percent, or more than $600 million, has been wiped off Jet's market value over the past year.
Now, with the airline's running out of ways to make money, state-run banks, led by SBI, took a temporary stake in Jet, promised a new loan of 15 billion rupees ($216 million) and forced 69-year-old Goyal to resign as chairman.
On Monday, Jet's lenders laid out terms for potential bidders to buy up to 75 percent stake in the carrier. Expressions of interest are due on Wednesday, with final bids due on April 30. [L3N21Q14Z]
But lessors remain concerned, and some, such as Avolon, SMBC Aviation Capital, Aircastle and a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp, have asked India's aviation regulator to de-register a combined 18 planes, according to the regulator's website.
""Despite Goyal's departure from Jet, lessors don't seem to think the carrier can be rescued, judging by the urgency in repossessing aircraft,"" said Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.
That adds complications for any potential new investor, two industry sources said.
""How we do business with Jet in the future will depend a lot on the new investor and how they manage the relationship,"" said one of the executives who was at the January meeting.
Aercap Holdings, GE Capital Aviation Services, Avolon and BOC Aviation are among the big lessors grounding Jet's aircraft, leasing and industry sources say. Aercap, Avolon and BOC Aviation declined to comment. GE Capital Aviation Services said Jet was a long-standing customer and it remains in regular contact with the airline.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
The humbling of one of India's most successful international brands illustrates the challenge of making money in the country's aviation sector, dominated by low-cost carriers such as IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd.
The Indian market is also highly price-sensitive, and airlines compete to keep fares low, even at a loss, to continue expanding. The domestic market has seen around 20 percent growth in the number of passengers over the past few years.
Carriers including IndiGo, SpiceJet and Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines and Tata Sons, have over 1,000 planes on order from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SA.
""India's aviation market is cut-throat and it is survival of the fittest. One needs not only deep pockets but a deep threshold for pain,"" said Yusof, adding that lessors will still seek business in the country despite the inherent risks.
When India's  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines went bankrupt in 2012, lessors were forced to write off millions of dollars in losses and thousands of people lost their jobs.
FALL FROM GRACE
When Goyal and his wife, Anita, started Jet in 1993, state-run Air India was the only formidable opponent, and the country's aviation market was just taking off.
Goyal's pitch was ensuring the country's biggest private carrier had impeccable service - a world-class product built in India, industry executives said.
Jet's problems began when it embarked on an aggressive international expansion plan, said an industry executive who has been associated with the airline.
The carrier ordered 22 wide-body aircraft for delivery over about 18 months, starting in 2006, depleting cash, the executive said.
Then Jet bought a struggling Indian airline called Sahara for 14.5 billion rupees ($209 million) in 2007 that had an ageing fleet and did not fit Jet's corporate culture, the industry executives said.
Meanwhile, a newcomer, low-cost carrier IndiGo, had begun chipping away at Jet's market share with cheap fares, one of the executives said.
In 2013, Jet was close to running out of cash, but survived collapse when Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways bought a 24 percent stake in the Indian airline. As part of the deal, Etihad also bought three pairs of Jet's landing slots at London's Heathrow airport and 51 percent stake in its frequent flyer program.
To compete with low-cost carriers, Jet has lowered prices without reducing its expensive services. High fuel prices and hefty taxes have compounded the spending issues, industry executives said.
Goyal, however, said in a statement last week after stepping down that the airline will ""regain its rightful place in the company of global greats."" 
HUMONGOUS TASK
Goyal's penchant for control, which helped him build the airline, has been a stumbling block for potential investors. Tata Sons was in talks with Jet in November for a deal that never materialized, sources have said.
Etihad has also been reluctant to increase its stake in the carrier for similar reasons, sources have said.
If no suitable investors turn up at the auction, lenders will pursue alternative plans, they said, without specifying what those might be.
SpiceJet has been in talks with lessors to take some of Jet's aircraft, a source has said.
Indian rules cap foreign airline investment in domestic carriers at 49 percent, and the government is eager to see Jet remain with an Indian entity, sources have said. That narrows the list of potential investors, aviation financiers and leasing executives said.
""It will be a humongous task for whoever comes in,"" one of the industry executives said.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said on Tuesday he was confident U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co would resolve issues related to its 737 MAX jet in the wake of two deadly crashes involving that type of aircraft.
Delta does not own the MAX, which was flown in the United States by its rivals Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines until a global grounding last month following the two deadly crashes.
The global 737 MAX ban came as Boeing was moving toward a decision on whether to launch an all-new jet program with a mid-sized model meant to straddle the narrowbody and widebody markets. 
Speaking at an aviation conference in Atlanta, Bastian said Delta was ""very interested"" in Boeing's proposed new mid-market airplane, though he said the world's largest planemaker was focusing first on dealing with the crisis surrounding the MAX. 
Delta shares have surged about 10 percent since the No. 2 U.S. airline raised its first-quarter profit estimate earlier this month on the back of strong business travel demand.

The Atlanta-based carrier is due to publish first-quarter results on Wednesday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Orders for Saudi Aramco's debut international bond topped $100 billion on Tuesday, a record breaking vote of market confidence for the oil giant which has faced investor concerns about government influence over the company.
State-owned Aramco is expected to raise more than $10 billion from the deal, which will be priced later on Tuesday and is seen as a gauge of potential investor interest in the Saudi company's eventual initial public offering.
Before the six-part bond deal was marketed on Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said initial indications of interest for the paper were over $30 billion.
Demand appeared to be the largest ever for emerging markets bonds, fund managers said, surpassing orderbook value of more than $52 billion for Qatar's $12 billion deal last year, $67 billion for Saudi Arabia's inaugural issue in 2016 and $69 billion orders for Argentina's $16.5 billion trade that year.
""Purely on figures, it is a fantastic credit,"" said Damien Buchet, CIO of the EM Total Return Strategy, Finisterre Capital.
But he added: ""The thing is, they are part of Saudi Arabia, they are a government arm. For equity investors this is always going to be an issue, more so than for bond investors.""
The Aramco bond has attracted interest from a wide range of investors, as the oil producer's vast profits would put its debt rating - if unconstrained by its sovereign links - in the same league as independent oil majors like  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (LON:RDSa).
Aramco has insisted on its independence while meeting investors ahead of the bond issue last week, saying the Saudi government remained committed to Aramco’s governance framework to safeguard its independence even when oil prices dropped.
But for some investors Riyadh's control over the oil giant is an issue as its state ownership means decisions will ultimately be for the benefit of the government rather than investors.
""Aramco is more transparent, has stronger credit metrics and is on an improving ESG (environmental, social and governance) trajectory whereas the government is more complex,"" said Mohieddine Kronfol, chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments.
""The link between the two however is understandably very strong,"" he said.
NO PREMIUM
Previously reluctant to do so, Aramco last week opened for the first time its books to investor scrutiny, showing it is by far the most profitable company in the world.
Having made core earnings of $224 billion last year and with $86 billion in free cash flow at the end of 2018, Aramco does not need to borrow.
Initial indications of over $30 billion in investor demand - before the bonds were actually sold - prompted Aramco to market the notes with almost no premium to Saudi government debt. 
""They are clearly trying to price it (the bond) off existing AA corporates in this world, so people are looking at curves like Shell, Total, Exxon but also technology giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"" said Buchet.
Aramco on Tuesday tightened initial price guidance by 15 basis points across the different bond maturities, meaning its bonds will yield less than Saudi Arabia, which owns it. This is rare, as state-owned entities generally offer higher returns than their governments.
""I think it's madness that's it's going inside the sovereign by a decent margin. Despite the fundamentals of Aramco, it's ultimately sovereign risk,"" said Richard Briggs, emerging markets strategist at London-based CreditSights.
The issue follows on the heels of Aramco's planned $69.1 billion acquisition of a 70 percent stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, a deal that many see as a transfer of government funds aimed at boosting the Saudi Crown Prince's economic agenda.
""This bond is being issued for two reasons: to establish Aramco's status as an independent corporate identity and to enable the transfer of wealth out of the company,"" said Marcus Chenevix, analyst, MENA and global political research at TS Lombard.
Aramco, however, said the bond issue was not linked to the SABIC acquisition, which will be paid in tranches through internal cash flow and, potentially, other resources.
Many see the deal as a relationship building exercise with international investors ahead of its planned initial public offering, scheduled for last year and then postponed to 2021.
The bonds are divided into tranches of three, five, 10, 20 and 30 years. The offering also includes a three-year floating rate bond.

Aramco has hired Lazard as financial adviser for the bond deal. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), HSBC, Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and National Commercial Bank have been chosen to arrange the bond issue.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 09:32AM ET</span>","Special Report: As Baby Powder concerns mounted, J&J focused marketing on minority, overweight women","By Chris Kirkham and Lisa Girion
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Pressure was mounting on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and its signature Baby Powder.
In 2006, an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talc such as Baby Powder as “possibly carcinogenic” when women used it as a genital antiperspirant and deodorant, as many had been doing for years. Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J&J and other customers.
J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtime users: African-American and overweight women. The “right place” to focus, according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was “under developed geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population,” the “AA” referring to African-Americans.
“Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,” the presentation said. “This could be an opportunity.”
In the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal company documents show. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach “curvy Southern (NYSE:SO) women 18-49 skewing African American.”
These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J’s decades-long efforts to offset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc, based on a Reuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence.
Adults have been the main users of Johnson’s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s, after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. As adults became ever more crucial to the brand – accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid-2000s – J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product’s “fresh and natural” qualities, to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women.
Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000 plaintiffs alleging that J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brand the company sold off in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.
Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&J cosmetic talcs – a claim supported by some studies showing an association between such use and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J’s talc products contained asbestos, long a known carcinogen.
In an investigation published Dec. 14 https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s to the early 2000s – information it did not disclose to regulators or the public.
J&J challenged the findings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurate and misleading.
BABY POWDER ""EVERYWHERE""
Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St. Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kim said Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she was growing up in New Jersey. Kim played baseball as a teenager, she said, and her mother told her to apply Baby Powder to avoid being “the stinky girl.”
“Every time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on,” recalled Kim, whose ovarian cancer, first diagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. “I put it on my panties, on my clothes, everywhere.”
J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests for an interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss the company’s marketing of cosmetic powders.
In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safe and asbestos-free. It noted that the company’s marketing over the years has been directed at many demographics and groups, and that “we’re proud pioneers of the practice of multicultural marketing.” It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn’t questioned.
Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing the company’s focus on African-American and overweight women at certain times. But the full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts, particularly those aimed at teenage girls, in minority communities and through organizations such as Weight Watchers, are reported here for the first time.
Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their products and, as a matter of course, direct their marketing at those groups. Some – fast-food companies and soft-drink makers, for example – have courted minority customers to increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about the possible health effects of their products.
In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood alleges that J&J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with its talc products and accuses the company of implementing a “racially targeted strategy” for selling Baby Powder after J&J became aware of health concerns. The company focused its marketing on “minority communities expected to be more likely to use the talc products,” Hood claims in the lawsuit.
J&J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in the suit, arguing that the case involved matters of federal law, beyond the state’s purview. A judge in December denied J&J’s motion, a move the company has appealed. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.
In its response to Reuters’ questions, J&J said: “Suggesting that Johnson & Johnson targeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensive and patently false.”
“DEEP, PERSONAL TRUST""
Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1 percent of J&J’s $81.6 billion in revenue last year, but it is deemed critical to the company’s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust.”
Beginning in the 1950s, however, a series of case studies published in medical journals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc. Pediatricians took notice. By the late 1950s, a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rash and chafing “because there is no dangerous dust” in them, according to an internal J&J report.
A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children, citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder, concluded there was “no justification” for using the product on babies because it has “no medicinal value.”
By 1974, more than 60 percent of Johnson’s Baby Powder sales were “attributable to adults” who used it on themselves, according to a J&J analysis.
Losing the connection to the product’s namesake – babies – left J&J eager to cultivate other markets.
Beginning in the 1970s, J&J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women, in addition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies. “You start being sexy when you stop trying,” was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972. The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man’s curly blond hair.
“It’s a feeling you never outgrow,” is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from the mid-1980s put it, with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bear alongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman.
In 1989, advertising firm Young & Rubicam submitted a plan to J&J to “initiate a high level of usage” among young women to “augment the weakening baby link.” Under the plan, ads in style magazines like Seventeen, YM, Glamour and Mademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson’s Baby Powder, “applied daily after showering, is a simple, feminine way to smell clean and fresh during the day.” Young & Rubicam, now known as VMLY&R, declined to comment on the document and referred questions to J&J.
Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Since health professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986 internal report warned, a “last straw” safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the product altogether.
As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women. A J&J memo that year mentions “high usage” rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers – and notes that women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population.
The memo suggests investigating “ethnic (African American/Hispanic) opportunities to grow the franchise,” while referring to “negative publicity from the health community on talc,” including “inhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage.” Portions of that memo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times.
STAGNATING SALES
By 2006, the company was recognizing that “consumers do not see a need for powder,” according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments had been “stagnating” in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to “find a new business model” that “strategically and efficiently targets high propensity consumers.”
Those groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percent of whom used Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for the overall population; overweight people; and fitness-conscious people looking to lose weight.
It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the World Health Organization, classified perineal use of talc as “possibly carcinogenic,” saying available research provided “limited evidence” it caused cancer in humans. That came about 20 years after IARC classified “talc containing asbestiform fibres” as “carcinogenic to humans,” its highest-risk classification.
After the IARC’s 2006 move, talc supplier Luzenac America started including a note about the agency’s latest classification on a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to all customers, including J&J. Under a heading that reads “carcinogenic status,” the document says IARC “has concluded that perineal use of talc-based body powder is possibly carcinogenic to humans.”
In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St. Louis, a Luzenac America executive, Shripal Sharma, said the company felt it was important to add what he referred to as a warning to the safety document. Asked whether Luzenac knew that J&J did not pass on this warning, Sharma said: “It is not our job to tell our customers what to do with their products.”
In a statement to Reuters, Imerys Talc America Inc, as Luzenac is now known, said: “Talc’s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies,” echoing J&J’s response.
Through an Imerys spokeswoman, Sharma declined to comment.
Two years after the IARC classification, J&J sought proposals for an “African American agency” to develop marketing campaigns for the company’s baby products line. A 2008 document sent to prospective agencies summed up the situation: “Johnson’s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products, while traditionally used only on babies, are today primarily consumed by adult AA women for use on themselves.” One way to reverse the brand’s decline, it said, was by “speaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effective media vehicles.”
“ETHNIC CONSUMERS”
That year, the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm, Segmented Marketing Services Inc, which says it specializes in targeted promotions to “ethnic consumers.” The firm would distribute 100,000 gift bags containing Baby Powder and other Johnson’s baby products in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago, according to a contract with J&J.
Run by African-Americans who had been executives at Procter & Gamble Co and Quaker Oats, Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and its own marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples and promotional offers through national networks of more than 10,000 African-American and Hispanic churches, and tens of thousands of “beauty salons, barber shops, entertainment venues and healthcare networks.”
The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution with Johnson’s baby products in which the firm’s founders, Sandra Miller Jones and Lafayette Jones, said they “welcome” J&J as a partner.
“When caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood, a person’s self-confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened,” the pamphlet said. “Whether in the gym, at work, at church or at the beach, Johnson’s Baby Powder helps grown-ups feel more comfortable in their own skin.” It came with a coupon for $1 off Baby Powder.
Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls, emails and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) messages seeking comment.
J&J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to “curvy Southern women” and athletic adults who want to smell fresh, according to company documents. It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus-size women and Curves, a women’s fitness and weight-loss franchise. Marketing plans also included ads to run in Southern Living magazine and during the Style Network show “Ruby,” a reality TV series that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight.
A 2009 presentation laying out the “Powder media plan” highlights that it will reach 31 million people “in the South (hot climates/overweight states),” and that “43% of our plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation.”
A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers “bust stress with a midday workout” and then “stay fresh post-exercise by applying Johnson’s Baby Powder.”
Internal J&J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discuss whether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intended audience. “Can you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women? They don’t have to be super curvy, but a little bigger than the current image would be preferable,” wrote Grace Lee, a J&J brand manager, to others at the company and ad agency Lowe New York.
Weight Watchers, now known officially as WW International Inc, declined to comment on the campaign. Lee & Interpublic Group of Companies Inc (NYSE:IPG), which owns the former Lowe New York, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
SUMMER SUCCESS
The Weight Watchers campaign was successful, according to a 2009 internal J&J recap, which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) shot up as much as 9 percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a year earlier, reversing a decline.
J&J’s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed $495,000 for 2010, up 71 percent from $288,000 in 2009, driven by more dedicated spending toward promotions for overweight women.
The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting “Curvy Southern Women 18‐49 Skewing African American.” A presentation from TMPG, a marketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs, said the campaign made more than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads and promotions on “urban adult contemporary” radio stations in Southern markets, including Dallas; Atlanta; Nashville; Mobile, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi.
The presentation slides feature some photos of plus-size African-American women holding Baby Powder samples at “targeted station events” that also included spa giveaways and “Baby Powder Stay Cool Cash.” TMPG did not respond to requests for comment.
In a 2010 email, Debra DeStasio, a J&J promotions and marketing manager who oversaw the baby products line at the time, gave the green light to two proposed radio stations for the campaign in Dallas, saying “we are good with those general market stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach.” In another 2010 email, she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder “brand ambassadors,” charged with “communicating our message, encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate.”
All the radio promotions would be “based on the weather,” she wrote. “If it’s hot and humid, we’ll run that week. If it’s rainy or colder, we won’t.”
DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, did not respond to requests for comment.
J&J’s spending on Baby Powder promotions – coupons, discounts, and samples – came to about $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed at overweight and minority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotional spending to $752,000, mostly aimed at the general consumer market.
In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use of Baby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn’t award monetary damages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits.
Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&J were overturned on appeal.
In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma, J&J was cleared of liability in five, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of $172 million in damages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials.
J&J is appealing all the verdicts against it.
Meanwhile, J&J has pulled back from marketing specifically to minority and overweight women. A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities, suggesting the brand “target adults, with a focus on men.”
Plaintiffs’ lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targeted marketing campaigns. In its most recent newsletter, the National Council of Negro Women, a women’s leadership group with about 30,000 members, drew attention to the issue with an essay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing some Baby Powder plaintiffs.
In an interview, Janice Mathis, the council’s executive director, said: “Lots of products target African-Americans. That’s marketing 101: Go where our customers are. What has me disturbed about this is that you didn’t give any caveat to the customers, once you knew there was a possibility there was some danger.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Aquis Exchange has revised its no-deal Brexit strategy in an effort to steal a march on rivals in the face of curbs on where investors can buy and sell stocks. 
The pan-European stock trading platform said on Tuesday that customers would be able to trade EU27 listed stocks in London as well as on its new Paris platform from Monday morning if the UK leaves the European Union without an exit deal. UK and Swiss shares would continue to be offered in London only. 
Britain is due to leave the EU on Friday unless it secures a ""standstill"" transition agreement to avoid a disruptive departure. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask an EU summit on Wednesday for a delay until at least the end of June. 
""Most volume in EU27 stocks would probably be done in London,"" Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said in a statement. 
It originally planned to offer EU27 stocks in Paris only to avoid harming prices by splitting trading. 
Larger rivals Cboe and London Stock Exchange's Turquoise, which have new EU hubs in Amsterdam, have announced similar changes. Aquis says it was going a step further by offering EU27 shares in London immediately after a no-deal Brexit to stop national exchanges in the bloc taking the business. 
Cboe and Turquoise have said they would seek to reintroduce EU27 shares in London later in the year. 
The EU's markets watchdog ruled last month that fund managers could only trade 6,200 shares in the bloc if Britain leaves without a deal. These are mostly EU27 listed stocks but also include 14 from Britain. 
If Britain's Financial Conduct Authority takes tit-for-tat action to require UK and many EU shares to be traded in Britain, it would give Aquis an early advantage over Turquoise and Cboe. 
Such a retaliatory move was ""highly likely"", Haynes said. The FCA has declined to comment on its plans. 
Aquis will revert to its preferred plan of trading EU27 shares only in Paris when it is clear the FCA won't introduce trading curbs, Haynes said. 

""My understanding is that the UK government does not want to see EU27 business move from London to Europe and will do whatever it can, unless some form of equivalence or financial services deal is agreed, to allow business to remain in London,"" he said. Trading in European government bonds and repurchase agreements on CME's London unit has already moved to Amsterdam.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA released new rules for companies that intend to bid for its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidiary Liquigas Distribuidora, according to a filing on Tuesday.
Hoping to increase the number of companies bidding, Petrobras, as the state-run oil company is known, reduced the amount of revenue a rival can have compared to Liquigas sales, when in a consortium.
Two weeks ago, Petrobras said that rivals with more than 10 percent of market share in the Brazilian LPG distribution market cannot have a stake in the consortium that is higher than 40 percent of Liquigas' revenue.
But according to new rules included in the documents filed on Tuesday, rivals may not have a stake in the consortium higher than 30 percent of Liquigas revenue, in an attempt to lure more participants to any potential consortium.
Restrictions for rivals are aimed at keeping antitrust authorities from blocking a deal, which happened in Petrobras' first attempt to sell Liquigas in 2017. 

 Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA has been hired to manage the sale. Potential buyers may contact Santander by April 19 to formalize its interest.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",French opposition targets national referendum on possible ADP privatization,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's opposition Socialist Party on Tuesday said it had enough support in parliament to start the process of forcing a national referendum on the government's plan to privatize airport operator ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), a Socialist lawmaker said.
The next threshold that must be met for a referendum on the possible privatization of ADP is for a nationwide petition to garner 4.5 million signatories.
The sale of all or part of the state's 50.6 percent stake in ADP is part of the government's strategy to cut the budget deficit and finance a long-promised 10 billion euro ($11.3 billion) innovation fund.
In March, the National Assembly, where Macron's En Marche party holds a strong majority, approved draft legislation for the possible privatization of ADP, lottery operator Francaise des Jeux and for a reduction in France's stake in utility Engie.
The bill was then rejected by the opposition-led Senate and returns back to the lower house this week, where it will likely be definitively approved on Thursday.
While the government would welcome the financial windfall that would be generated by the sale of its ADP stake, the move is politically delicate. Many opposition lawmakers and voters disapprove of handing control of the strategic asset to the private sector.

Socialist member of parliament Boris Vallaud said that 197 lawmakers from both the right and left had given support to launching procedures for a referendum on the issue. Only 185 signatures were needed.

1228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Ford Wins Truck Bragging Rights While GM Rolls Out New Big Rigs,"(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is saying not so fast to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s claim to total U.S. truck sales leadership.
In the first quarter, Ford delivered more F-Series pickups than GM sold Chevrolet Silverado, Colorado and GMC Sierra and Canyon trucks. GM has tallied up its total volume from its four models the last few years and stacked them up against Ford’s F-Series to claim superiority, including during an investor day in January.
The results are somewhat of a surprise, since the F-150 is the oldest light-duty truck line in Detroit. GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rolled out redesigned versions of their full-size pickups last year and are ramping up production. But Ford also has fresh metal in showrooms, having just revived the mid-size Ranger that started selling in January. This new addition to the lineup may help Ford to hold onto its early lead through the rest of the year.
“We knew we were going to be facing intense competition,” Mark LaNeve, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, said in a phone interview. “We’re delighted that so far, we’ve withstood it pretty well.”
The F-Series has been the best-selling model line in the U.S. for almost four decades. As Ford abandons the traditional sedan market, it’s key that the company protect its full-size truck turf and reclaim some of the ground given up in the mid-size pickup segment it sat out from for seven years.
In January, Ford said the operating-profit margin for its worldwide truck and van business was 14 percent in 2017, miles ahead of the 4.4 percent margin the company earned from all its auto operations last year.
Ford started April with 84 days supply of F-Series in inventory, according to Automotive News Data Center. GM had 128 days of Silverado and 109 days of Sierra supply, while Fiat Chrysler had 134 days of Ram pickups.
LaNeve, Ford’s sales chief, said the company is “very comfortable” where it’s at in terms of truck inventory.
“I tend not to worry that could be a precursor to more aggressive activity in the market,” LaNeve said. “All three of us build so many pickups that you could adjust production so quickly. They could take that number down by adjusting production actually a lot easier than spending more incentive money. I’m not predicting they’re going to do that.”
While GM may have lost the first-quarter truck battle, it didn’t go down without some fighting words. Jim Cain, a spokesman, said Ford’s total vehicle sales to retail customers -- excluding deliveries to rental-car companies and other fleet buyers -- ranked fifth in March, behind GM, Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., and Fiat Chrysler.
“If I were Ford and my retail sales had fallen to No. 5 in the industry, I’m not sure I would crow so much about the success of one product,” Cain said in an email."

LONDON (Reuters) - April's stocks rally risked running out of puff on Tuesday, as a U.S. threat to slap tariffs on hundreds of European goods and expectations of another chunky chop to the IMF’s global growth forecasts tested investors' stamina.
Asia had eked out a 8-month high overnight but Europe and Wall Street futures were both left flat after Donald Trump welcomed the World Trade Organisation's finding that Europe's subsides to planemaker Airbus had hurt the United States.
The U.S. ""will now put tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!"" Trump tweeted. ""The EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!""
Airbus' shares dropped as much as 2.5 percent. Many of its key suppliers lost between 0.7 percent and 1.2 percent, though most of Europe's big bourses managed to keep their levels broadly flat. 
Aberdeen Standard Investment's head of global multi-asset strategy Andrew Milligan said: ""Signals like this just remind people that the strategic rivalry between the U.S. and other countries is serious and is not going to go away.""
The day's other focus was set to be the International Monetary Fund's half-yearly forecasts, which are likely to reinforce the message that trade spats are contributing to slowing the global economy.
The Fund is expected to make quite a sizable cut to its growth number and Germany's 10-year bond yield stayed just below zero percent on bets interest rates are set to stay extremely low globally. 
In the FX market, sterling nudged higher as UK Prime Minister Theresa May met Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron to ask for another Brexit delay.
The Australian and Canadian dollars, Norwegian crown and Russian rouble also rose as a surge in oil prices to five-month highs lifted most other commodity-linked currencies. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil firm also set the commodity market frothing on reports it had received more than $100 billion (£76.5 billion) of orders for its debut international bond, which was only supposed to raise $10 billion. 
Brent, the global oil benchmark, rose as high as $71.34 a barrel, the highest since November, though by 1230 GMT it had eased back to $71.00. U.S. WTI crude was at $64.28, having earlier been at $64.77.
Oil prices - up more than 40 percent this year - have jumped on expectations that global supplies will tighten due to fighting in Libya, OPEC-led output cuts and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela.
""Concerns over the potential squeezing of supply in Libya following the escalation of violence there are adding fresh impetus,"" analysts at JBC Energy wrote.
PLANE SPEAKING
The flat start that looked likely for Wall Street came as focus shifted to the start of the first-quarter earnings season later this week, and as European officials warned that if Trump targeted Airbus, they would hit Boeing (NYSE:BA). 
In emerging markets, eyebrows were raised too as Kazakhstan said it was bringing forward presidential elections due to be held next year to June. Former President Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped down last month after three decades in power.
The additional surprise on Tuesday was that his daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva has no plans to run in the June vote, according to her aide. 
That leaves interim president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in the driving seat, but may fan speculation of a power struggle.

At the same time, ""it will reduce the uncertainty that was otherwise going to sit there for the next 18 months,"" said Renaissance Capital's head of macro-strategy Charles Robertson.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish bank SEB's fund management arm has cut its stake in rival Swedbank by just over half, citing risks Sweden's biggest mortgage lender faces due to its alleged involvement in a fast-growing Baltic money laundering scandal. 
Swedbank has come under heavy criticism from politicians, investors and the general public over allegations that its Baltic operations processed billions of dollars of transactions linked to Russian money laundering.
The scandal, which broke on Feb. 20, has led to Swedbank's CEO and chairman leaving and the launch of several regulatory investigations into the bank.
SEB Fonder has reduced its Swedbank stake to just under 1 percent from just over 2 percent over the past two months, having sold nearly 5 million shares in March and over 7 million shares in February, according to the company and based on data published on Tuesday.
Before the cut, SEB was Swedbank's 10th largest shareholder according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
""The decision to reduce ownership in Swedbank is a management decision, based on the information that is gradually published about Swedbank,"" SEB Investment Management's head Hans Ek told Reuters by email.
He added that SEB had drawn parallels with respect to price developments with other companies suspected of lacking in money laundering controls.

Swedbank shares have fallen by one third as the scandal has grown, with the latest report suggesting its Estonian accounts dealt with roughly 135 billion euros of suspicious cash, predominantly from Russian clients.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 07:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bottle maker Verallia set for possible 4 billion euros IPO - sources,"By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Apollo is preparing French glass bottle maker Verallia for a stock market listing later this year, in what could become one of the largest French initial public offerings of the year, people close to the matter said. 
The private equity firm, which is working with Lazard as its IPO advisor, has asked banks to pitch in coming days for roles in organizing the flotation, which could value Verallia at more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion), they said.
Rothschild is advising Verallia, they added.
Verallia, which traces its roots back to the Vauxrot glassworks founded in 1827, counts  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), champagne house Dom Perignon and chocolate spreads maker Nutella among its clients.
So-called global coordinators are expected to be mandated later this month or in May for the IPO of Saint-Gobain's former glass bottle unit, in which Apollo bought a controlling stake in 2015. The listing may happen in September or later, they said. 
Apollo and Lazard declined to comment, while Rothschild had no immediate comment.
France has seen few IPOs recently and some deals, such as that of logistics firm Gefco, have been pulled due to wobbly market conditions. Tourism group Club Med's parent chose Hong Kong for its listing.
Among the few other large French companies which may seek a stock market listing this year is state-owned lottery firm Francaise des Jeux, a stake in which could be sold under a law published last year.
Across Europe initial public offerings slumped in the first quarter to their lowest since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and the U.S.- China trade dispute left companies not wanting to take their chances.
Verallia is expected to post core earnings (EBITDA) of roughly 550 million euros this year and could be valued at between 7 and 8 times that in a potential IPO, the sources said. 
Peers such as Vetropack, Owens-Illinois (NYSE:OI) or Vidrala trade in a wide range of 2.7 to 9.4 times EBITDA.
Apollo bought the majority of Verallia in a 2015 deal valuing the business at 2.95 billion euros. It made 16 billion glass bottles and jars last year and is the main supplier of bottles for France's champagne and cognac industries. 
In 2018, the company - which employs nearly 10,000 people - generated 544 million euros in adjusted EBITDA on sales of 2.4 billion.
Earlier this month, Verallia announced the early repayment of some of its debt, citing solid cash flow generation, pushing its net debt down to 1.7 billion euros or 3.1 times core 2018 earnings.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is considering scaling back its bond and equity sales and trading operations in London and New York as part of a broader restructuring of its global markets division, two sources said on Tuesday.
MUFG, Japan's biggest bank by assets, will also overhaul its Japanese equity business at home and overseas. 
The move comes after Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings last week said it would cut $1 billion in costs from its wholesale business and shut domestic retail branches.
MUFG has yet to finalize the plans, the sources said, declining to be identified because the information was not yet public. The size of the likely reductions was not clear. It was also unclear how many people are employed in the affected divisions.
A representative for MUFG said the bank was progressing in its structural reform plans but declined to comment further.
The bank aims to redeploy staff elsewhere, avoiding a material reduction in headcount, the sources said.
Under its mid-term plan announced last year, MUFG has been focused on strengthening the global markets business, which offers bonds, stocks, currencies and derivative sales and trading to institutional and corporate clients.
It has been working to bring the group, which falls under its core banking unit, under the same management as its Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities joint venture and build its global presence.

However, MUFG's ambitions have been stymied by tough competition from U.S. and European banks and, particularly for bond trading, a difficult market after years of low interest rates.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",How college students can find jobs - without much work experience,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When college student Danny Franklin started thinking about jobs after graduation, his expectations were not very high.
The 21-year-old accounting major at Delaware State had the typical work experience of many young Americans: Not a whole lot. 
Franklin's job history included stints at McDonald’s, Sears, and Sam’s Club – but nothing that would really grab the attention of a big accounting firm.
No wonder Franklin's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) page did not generate any job leads. Then his adviser in junior year told him about Handshake (joinhandshake.com), a jobs community for college kids and young alumni.
After a month or two of building his Handshake profile, he was taken aback: Companies were starting to contact him, instead of the other way around.
“I was very surprised and overwhelmed,” says Franklin. “Companies were telling me about internships, professional development events and inviting me to apply to all these things.”
Among the big-name firms that got in touch were consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, and a couple of the nation’s largest accounting concerns, Deloitte and PwC. 
Franklin ended up accepting a position with prominent investment managers Capital Group, in its Norfolk, Virginia. offices. He is slated to start a full-time position there in the fall, after his graduation this spring.
CULTIVATING EXPERIENCE
Franklin managed to solve a tricky puzzle young grads encounter when entering the workforce. How do you get that first job in your chosen field, when you do not have any experience yet?
“LinkedIn is more of a mid-career tool, when you already have work experience and your professional network is established,” says Garrett Lord, Handshake’s CEO and co-founder. “But many students don’t have that work experience yet and may not even know what they want. That’s where Handshake shines.”
After all, it is not easy for young adults to get on that first rung of the corporate ladder, even in a hot economy. In fact, 41.4 percent of recent grads are considered “underemployed,” or working in a lower-level gig that did not require a degree, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
It is an easier leap to make for students at big-name universities – like, say, Harvard or Yale – since Fortune 500 companies will physically come to their campuses and job fairs and actively recruit. But for students at smaller colleges that may not be on recruiters’ radars, like Danny Franklin at Delaware State, how are they supposed to get started in life?
It was a familiar problem for Garrett Lord, himself a graduate of Michigan Tech, which was not exactly the first stop on the trail for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recruiters. That is why he and his co-founders started Handshake, to create something akin to LinkedIn, but focused on college kids and young grads across the country and not just those in the Ivy League.
Handshake’s numbers so far are impressive: 14 million college students and young alumni, more than 700 colleges in its network, 900,000 recruiters – and, notably, 100 percent of the Fortune 500.
It has obviously caught the attention of significant Silicon Valley movers, with backers like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (yes, that Zuckerberg), the Omidyar Network (that’s Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)), venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, and more.
It is certainly a sea change from the college jobs offices of yore. Those of us of a certain age remember dusty and disorganized operations, with harried supervisors, cluttered desks and index cards of random job offers tacked up on corkboards.
By and large, job-hunting at colleges does not work like that anymore. In fact, Handshake has partnered with 70 percent of the top 500 universities in the country, matching them with 350,000 companies trying to fill slots.
Of course, students do not necessarily need to choose between career apps. They can leverage all of them and boost their odds of getting HR managers' attention. 
When Danny Franklin racked up an impressive 3.5 GPA, joined his school’s accounting club and put in some volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity, he uploaded it all – and, apparently, it paid off. 
“Without that profile, I would probably still be applying for jobs.”

Marc Ostwald, a strategist with ADM ISI in London, said that the volume of goods set to be hit with tariffs, at $11 billion, is “relatively modest” but said “it still sends the wrong signal in terms of 'direction of travel' on bilateral U.S./EU trade relations.”
Boeing (NYSE:BA), which would be the notional beneficiary of trade measures taken in its defense by the U.S., is indicated down another 0.1% in premarket trading, after falling over 4% on Monday in response to its announcement that it would cut production of the 737 Max model by up to a fifth.
Elsewhere, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is indicated to open unchanged after news that it has bid $7.1 billion for Australian casino operator Crown Resorts.
Energy stocks are still enjoying support from a continuing rally in oil prices  caused by signs of rising violence in Libya, which threatens to disrupt the north African country’s exports. There are initial signs that countries such as Russia want to ease the current output restraint agreement with OPEC that ends in June.

In June, Mediaset prevented the trust from voting at its annual general meeting, prompting Simon Fiduciaria to launch a legal challenge to have two of the decisions taken at the meeting scrapped. 

The two decisions related to the establishment of an incentive and retention plan and of a stock option plan.

The request will be included in a white paper on the company scheduled to be introduced in parliament on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported, citing a source. If approved, the funds would be paid out in stages, the report said. 
Felda, as the state-owned company is known, has been struggling to pay down debt amid financial losses and corruption allegations. 
The government of Mahathir Mohamad, who came to power last year after defeating Malaysia's longtime ruling coalition, had vowed to look into Felda's financial troubles and alleged graft. 
Felda and Malaysia's Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is preparing the white paper, did not respond to requests for comment on the Bloomberg report. 
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told reporters on Tuesday the government had to support Felda as the previous government had caused ""huge losses"". He did not elaborate. 
Felda was set up to help palm oil farmers, who work for the agency, and also has a one-third stake in FGV Holdings Bhd, the world's largest crude palm oil producer. 
Palm oil farmers on Felda land have been grappling with rising costs of living and high debt due to insufficient income. 
Felda has diversified in recent years into property, including hotels, both locally and overseas, but has been plagued by issues of poor management. 
Last year, Felda said it would sell assets including property in London, restructure some loans, and try to boost cash flow to trim nearly $2 billion in debt.
A former Felda chairman was charged in December with breach of trust and receiving bribes over the purchase of a Malaysian hotel while he was in charge of Felda. 

The Mahathir government has said it would investigate several ""highly suspicious"" deals done by the previous administration, including the $500 million acquisition of a non-controlling stake in Indonesia's Eagle High Plantations. The deal had drawn criticism as it was seen as overpriced.

1241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",5 Reasons Investors Can’t Get Enough of Saudi Aramco’s Debt,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Saudi Aramco checks just about every box for a bond investor. 
Not only is it the world’s largest oil company, it also generated the most profit of any corporation across the globe in 2018. Moody’s Investors Service says it has “many characteristics of a Aaa-rated corporate,” yet with a rating four steps lower than that, it still offers a decent yield pickup. It has never issued dollar debt before, a big perk for money managers who crave diversification. And it has the star power of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Jamie Dimon behind it. Put it all together, and it’s little wonder that the $10 billion deal(1) has already received more than $60 billion of orders.
That’s not to say it’s without risks. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Liam Denning pointed out earlier this month upon reviewing some 500 pages of offering documents, the overarching concern is Aramco’s tight link to the Saudi government. The biggest winner from the sale probably isn’t Aramco but rather the sovereign wealth fund. It’s also worth wondering what the energy sector — and therefore the financial situation of Saudi Arabia itself — will look like in 20 to 30 years when portions of this bond sale mature.
But those are clearly an afterthought, judging by Aramco’s initial price talk. The sale is set to wrap up Tuesday. Let’s drill a bit deeper into five possible reasons investors are gobbling up what’s being called the “most highly anticipated sale of the year.”
1. New Name
This offering marks Aramco’s debut in the dollar-bond market. That’s a bonus for money managers because it helps diversify their portfolios.
Not only does it add a new “name” to the market, but Aramco also represents higher credit quality when more than half of the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Corporate Bond Index is rated in the triple-B tier. Aramco, by contrast, has an A1 grade from Moody’s and an equivalent A+ from Fitch Ratings. While lower-rated securities are somewhat back in vogue, nothing has changed about their inflated debt levels and stretched balance sheets. That’s not the case for Aramco.
2. Unique Risks
Aramco has “minimal debt relative to cash flows, large scale of production, market leadership and access in Saudi Arabia to one of the world’s largest hydrocarbon reserves. These features position it favorably against the strongest oil and gas companies,” Moody’s analyst Rehan Akbar wrote in a report earlier this month. Its adjusted debt-to-book capitalization of 14.7 percent as of the end of 2018 was even better than top-rated Exxon Mobil Corp. 
The best way to visualize Aramco’s advantages is this chart that Denning compiled of the integrated oil industry’s main financial metric, return on capital employed:
That’s nothing short of phenomenal. Still, Aramco’s location and its ties to the government pose unique risks. It’s worth remembering that the entire point of this bond sale is to buy a majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the country’s largest listed company. Denning wrote that it “effectively shuffles state assets from one pocket to another.”
Again, for investors, it comes back to diversification. In many ways, Aramco and Saudi Arabia are one and the same. So adding quasi-sovereign obligations may simply be more palatable than taking on debt of another leveraged American company.
3. Yield Spread
To be sure, there are lines that some investors won’t cross. Jim Barrineau, head of emerging-market debt at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc, told Bloomberg News that he wouldn’t buy Aramco’s bonds at a rate lower than the Saudi government’s. That’s a very real possibility, given the initial price talk was in line with the sovereign curve. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Marcus Ashworth figures that with such demand, Aramco can either boost the size of the deal or offer even lower yields.
While far from a perfect comparison, the Bloomberg Barclays index of U.S. corporate debt has an average maturity of 11 years and a spread of 116 basis points to Treasuries. Aramco’s 10-year portion may have a yield equal to the benchmark 10-year Treasury note plus an extra 125 basis points. In that sense, it might not be a bargain, but it’s not vastly overpriced either.
4. Favorable Market
The broad bond market is on solid footing. The Federal Reserve looks as if it’s done raising interest rates indefinitely, pushing credit spreads to the narrowest in months. Only about $16 billion of investment-grade U.S. bonds priced last week, short of estimates of $20 billion to $25 billion, potentially freeing up extra cash among fund managers who saw $2.9 billion come pouring in during the week ended April 3. It was the 10th consecutive week of inflows.
Plus, in a boon to Aramco, oil prices are the highest in five months.
5. Dimon, FOMO
To top it off, some star power is backing this bond sale, and persistent updates on the swelling order book may have created a fear of missing out. 
Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive officer, spoke at a lunch in New York last week to market the deal, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke to Bloomberg News. A widely successful sale could give the banks involved an inside track on running an initial public offering by Aramco, should that ever happen.
Perhaps it’s little surprise then that details on the huge order book have been easy to come by. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in early U.S. hours on Monday that demand was higher than $30 billion. Six hours later, Bloomberg News reported it was about $40 billion. A few hours later, word came in that the deal received $60 billion in bids, surpassing the previous record held by Qatar.
I’m of the mind that a deal being “oversubscribed” is a fairly useless metric — it just means yields were too high to begin with — but I can see how strong demand could reassure investors that liquidity will be strong in the secondary market.
Put it together, and Aramco has all the ingredients for a blockbuster sale. 
(1) Aramco could still increase the size of the offering."

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 06:14AM ET</span>","In New York, confusion reigns in the emerging CBD edibles business","By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state officials told food growers and processors in mid-December that they had the state's blessing to produce and sell tea and chocolates laced with CBD, the cannabis derivative reputed to ease anxiety and other ills without marijuana's high.
But since then, New York City health inspectors have seized thousands of dollars worth of CBD-infused food and drinks at the Fat Cat Kitchen and other local cafes and restaurants, and warned owners to stop selling them or face penalties. The crackdown came just weeks after federal law explicitly made CBD legal across the country.
The New York City crackdown highlights the inconsistencies that have emerged in federal, state and local rules governing CBD, bewildering the small but growing number of businesses selling edibles in New York and other states. 
""I'm trying to be compliant with the law, but no one seems to be fully aware of what the law is and isn't,"" said C.J. Holm, the owner of the Fat Cat Kitchen, which touts CBD coffee and cookies on a sidewalk chalkboard.
Consumer interest in CBD tinctures, topical creams and edibles has grown in recent years in step with the piecemeal legalization of marijuana, which is now permitted as either a medical or recreational drug in 33 states while still banned by the federal government.
In 2018, U.S. consumers spent an estimated $300 million on CBD food and drinks, according to a report by Cowen Washington Research Group. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and other food giants have expressed interest in the sector.
The 2018 Farm Bill, enacted in December, was intended in part to clear up the legal status of CBD by legalizing cannabis extracts derived from strains of the plant, known as hemp, that contain very low concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. 
But the law also created new confusion for businesses wanting to sell CBD food or drink. For some, it is impossible to follow one set of regulations without being in breach of another. 
In New York, for example, officials at the state Department of Agriculture issued guidance in December saying it was legal to sell ""CBD tea,"" ""chocolates with CBD drizzle"" and other CBD edibles, so long as the products are made and marketed as dietary supplements, which are governed by more stringent standards than ordinary food.
But the department also warns that doing this will run afoul of rules issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which said it was unlawful to add CBD to food or to market it as a dietary supplement. That is because the agency, for the first time last year, had approved a drug that contained CBD as the active ingredient. 
New York City health inspectors have taken the FDA rule seriously. At the Fat Cat Kitchen, Holm was startled when a health inspector impounded her CBD powder, honey, snacks and raw cookie dough in February. Similar scenes played out at four other eateries in the city.
Soon afterward, Holm and other restaurateurs received a letter from the department saying inspectors would resume the seizures after July 1.
It is unclear whether the city's Health Department will allow cafes and restaurants to sell CBD edibles even as a dietary supplement, despite New York state officials saying such products are legal. 
When asked, Michael Lanza, a Health Department spokesman, repeated the department's position that it is following the FDA ban on CBD food and drink in any form. An FDA spokesman declined to comment on New York's regulations.
Colorado, Maine and other states have attempted to clarify the status of CBD-laced edibles by passing laws allowing the addition of CBD to food. 
The FDA has said it may make an exception for CBD, allowing it as a food additive or dietary supplement even though it is now a listed drug. It will hold a public forum on the issue in Maryland on May 31.
With the conflicting rules and at best haphazard enforcement, Holm and other CBD vendors say they are pressing ahead, devising their own strategies that they feel are at least a gesture toward compliance.
Igor Yakovlev, who stirs CBD into honey on New York's Staten Island, prints a disclaimer on each Beezy Beez Honey jar stating that the FDA has not ""evaluated or approved"" his product.
Holm, in consultation with a lawyer, noted that the FDA bans CBD being added to food for ""interstate commerce,"" and reasons she is fine to sell CBD coffee so long as the extract is produced and processed in New York.

""It is so confusing because you can ask three different attorneys and get three different answers,"" said Allan Gandelman, a farmer in Cortland who founded the New York Cannabis Growers and Processors Association earlier this year. ""So you decide you're going to blaze a path forward, and produce a product that customers really want, and go for it until the government gets its act together.""

With the move, the USTR said it was kicking off the process for retaliation against over $11 billion worth of damage from EU subsidies to Airbus that the World Trade Organization has found cause ""adverse effects"" to the United States. 
The European Union and the United States have been battling for more than a decade over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus, with parallel cases at the WTO. Both sides have been caught paying billions of dollars of subsidies to gain advantage in the global jet business.
The move by the USTR marks an escalation of tensions as the United States seeks to slap hefty tariffs on a range of EU products. The EU has left most of its subsidies unchanged and launched additional aid since the challenge, USTR said.
""Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional U.S. duties imposed in response can be lifted,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in the statement.
The WTO said last year it would evaluate a U.S. request to slap billions of dollars worth of sanctions on European products in response to a ruling that the EU had doled out the illegal subsidies to the aircraft giant.
The United States has estimated the value of those subsidies worth $11.2 billion in trade, though the EU has challenged that estimate. 

The USTR said it would announce a final product list after a WTO arbiter evaluates the claims. The result is expected this summer, the statement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Market regulators are poised to approve trading of a new kind of product that could bring more stockpickers to U.S. exchange-traded funds, according to a filing on Monday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's conditional approval would allow Precidian Investments to license a new type of actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that, like traditional active mutual funds, will not be required to disclose what it owns on a daily basis as most current active ETFs must.
The Precidian funds will disclose daily holdings only to a new subset of professional trader called the “authorized participant representative” in order to facilitate the process of creation and redemption of ETF shares, the filing said.
The SEC, which had twice before declined to give a green light to Precidian's non-transparent active ETFs due to concerns about whether the funds' prices would track their holdings, said it would approve the proposal unless its commissioners decide to order a hearing.
Bedford, New Jersey-based Precidian’s ActiveShares technology - which has been licensed by fund companies including ETF giant BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) - is designed for money managers who actively pick stocks and bonds instead of following a market index.
The new products could potentially spur fund managers to offer more active ETFs and improve their performance by not revealing their trading strategies to rivals.
Daniel McCabe, chief executive officer of Precidian Investments, said many active managers have been unwilling to bring ETFs to market because they did not want to expose their trades to the public immediately. 
The new structure offers investors access to those fund managers with many of the benefits enjoyed by ETF investors, including their ability to sidestep some capital gains taxes that accrue in mutual funds, McCabe said.
""The same benefits that are you look at in today’s ETFs are available in this structure but it works not only for an index-based product but specifically for active managers,” he said.
""This is very good news for investors.”
Asset management firm  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM) holds a minority equity position in Precidian.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Crimefighters in Switzerland and Brazil pledged to intensify cooperation to resolve the sprawling corruption case linked to state oil firm Petrobras in which around 700 million Swiss francs ($701 million) remain frozen in Switzerland.
Switzerland has so far returned roughly 365 million Swiss francs ($365.6 million) to Brazil related to Petrobras and construction firm Odebrecht, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said on Tuesday, including 9 million francs in March.
Around 70 related criminal proceedings are under way in Switzerland, two of which are scrutinizing Swiss financial groups, the OAG said after Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber and Brazilian Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge met in Brasilia on Monday.
""The two counterparts signed a joint declaration reaffirming their commitment to continue and intensify their cooperation,"" the OAG said in a statement.
More than 130 businessmen and politicians have been convicted in Brazil in the case, focused on political kickbacks and money laundering at Petrobras and Odebrecht. Ex-Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is serving a 12-year prison sentence.

Around 15 criminal cases opened in Switzerland have been passed along to authorities in Brazil. The probe has also swept up leading global commodity traders based in Switzerland.

Investing.com -- The people at Airbus probably knew it was too good to last.
The company’s shares were down 2.0% after early trading in Tuesday in response to news that the U.S. administration is preparing tariffs on $11 billion worth of EU imports as a reaction to what it sees as unfair subsidies to Europe’s aerospace champion.
The threat of a new trade conflict flaring up has held back the broader market, but not stopped it eking out further gains. At 04:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% at 387.82. Germany’s Dax was down 0.2%, while the French CAC 40 was up 0.1% at a new seven-month high.
Airbus has hit a series of all-time highs this year, capitalizing on the company’s position as a duopolist in wide-bodied aircraft, one of the most surefire global growth sectors of the next 20 years.
In a duopoly, what is bad for one is almost inevitably good for the other. The human disasters with Boeing’s 737 Max have tilted demand back to its only major competitor, something that will over time further fatten Airbus’ order book and allow it to charge higher prices. (The same process worked in reverse for a time after the AF447 crash involving an Airbus A330 in 2009.)
Things got worse for Boeing (NYSE:BA) recently when China used the 737 Max issue to prove a point to the U.S. about its commercial power, placing a huge order for Airbus and dropping the 737 Max from a shopping list of U.S.-made goods that are part of ongoing trade talks with Washington.
Boeing shares fell over 4.4% Monday after the company said it would cut production of the model by nearly one-fifth.
So the supportive barrage from the Trump administration clearly comes at a good time for Boeing. Europeans will suspect that its timing is not a coincidence.
Whether it will lead anywhere is another matter. The two sides have been suing one another at the World Trade Organization over various alleged subsidies for 14 years. Neither side can afford to see their champion go down, and it isn’t clear that a significant shift in market power between the two would benefit the world’s aircraft buyers. Most of all, Europe would be sure to react with tariffs of its own, raising the economic risks for President Trump as he seeks re-election next year."
1250,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:14AM ET</span>","In video address, Ghosn says he is innocent and victim of backstabbing","By Naomi Tajitsu and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said he was innocent and slammed former colleagues whom he accused of backstabbing and conspiring against him, in a pre-recorded video that marked his first public address since his initial arrest last year.
Prosecutors took the highly unusual step of re-arresting Ghosn last week on fresh allegations that he used company funds to enrich himself to the tune of $5 million. The once-feted executive had been out on $9 million bail for 30 days, during which he recorded the video screened by his lawyers on Tuesday.
In the video, shown to reporters in Tokyo, the former Nissan Motor Co chairman said he was the victim of selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
Ghosn called out some individuals by name in the video but those references were removed due to legal concerns, his lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka told reporters.
The video - together with Hironaka's comments alleging harsh treatment by Tokyo prosecutors against Ghosn and his wife, Carole - cast Ghosn as the victim of both internal rivals and the Japanese judicial system.
""This is a conspiracy ... this is not about greed or dictatorship, this is about a plot, this about a conspiracy, this is about a backstabbing,"" Ghosn said in the video.
He was wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt. His hands were folded in front of him as he looked into the camera and spoke in a clipped, matter-of-fact manner. His hair appeared to be greyer and his face thinner than before last year's arrest. 
The conspiracy, he said, was borne out of fear that he would bring Nissan closer to its partner and top shareholder, Renault. 
""There was fear that the next step of the alliance in terms of convergence and in terms of moving towards a merger, would in a certain way threaten some people or eventually threaten the autonomy of Nissan,"" he said.
PHYSICAL, MENTAL PRESSURE
Hironaka told the briefing that prosecutors were acting in a ""cruel way"" and putting him under intense physical and mental pressure to get a confession.
Prosecutors were not immediately available for comment.
Hironaka has previously criticized the move by prosecutors to confiscate Ghosn's belongings, including his mobile phone and trial documents, along with the mobile phones and Lebanese passport of his wife, Carole, who was present when prosecutors entered their home early in the morning last Thursday.
The lawyer said on Tuesday that Ghosn's wife, who left Japan last week, did so out of concern for her own safety, adding she intended to protest the case to the French government.
However, France's finance minister said on Tuesday that political interventions might not be the best way to help Ghosn, raising some questions about how much pressure Paris was willing to put on Tokyo over the issue.
The case has rocked the global auto industry and also shone a harsh light on Japan's judicial system.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors are able to hold suspects for up to 22 days without charge and interrogate them without their lawyers present.
Such procedures have focused much attention in the West on Japan's judicial system, which critics sometimes refer to as ""hostage justice"", because defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail.
Ghosn has been charged with under-reporting his Nissan salary for a decade, and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. However, the new, $5 million allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes.

On Monday, Nissan shareholders ousted him as a director, severing his last tie with the automaker he rescued from near-bankruptcy two decades ago.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 04:08AM ET</span>",Big Wynn? Vegas giant makes $7.1 billion play for Australia's Crown,"By Byron Kaye and Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - World No. 2 casino operator Wynn Resorts made a A$10 billion ($7.1 billion) takeover approach for Australia's Crown Resorts, the target company said on Tuesday, hoping to expand its geographic reach as it faces growth hurdles in Asia.
The deal would offer Wynn a hedge against Macau, the Chinese gambling hub where its licenses are up for renewal, by giving it two lavishly revamped Australian casinos and a third still being built on the prized Sydney harbor front.
For Crown 47-percent owner James Packer, who re-badged his father's media empire as a gambling concern in 2007 only to withdraw from business engagements last year due to mental illness, the deal would end his career as a casino mogul with a A$4.7 billion payout.
He would end up Wynn's biggest shareholder with 9.8 percent of its shares, based on its current number of shares on issue.
Crown shares jumped 20 percent to A$14.07 in afternoon trade in Sydney following the announcement, their biggest intraday gain since the company re-listed with its current name 12 years ago. Even so, they were still below the indicative buyout price of A$14.75 due to uncertainty about whether a deal would eventuate.
""It's a preliminary-style bid which doesn't yet provide an adequate premium for control, and most would expect there to be both more debate about the strategic merit and pricing,"" said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, which holds Crown shares.
The deal, which would be subject to regulatory approval, would be Australia's biggest M&A deal so far this year. The gambling regulator in Victoria, the location of Crown's flagship casino, said it must be satisfied any new owner is a suitable gambling operator.
Crown said Wynn was proposing to buy the company half in cash, half in shares. Talks were at a preliminary stage, the companies had not agreed on a value or deal structure, and current proposal had not gone to the board, it added. 
A Wynn spokesman declined to comment.
A spokesman for Consolidated Press Holdings, Packer's company which holds his Crown shares, was also not immediately available for comment.
TIMING
While Wynn offered a chunky 26 percent premium to Crown's last share close, a deal would hand the Las Vegas-based company a once-formidable rival at a vulnerable moment. 
Crown tore up its global expansion plans after 18 of its staff were arrested in China in 2016, and focused on shining up its Australian assets including casinos in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. As part of that pull-back, it sold a casino development site in Las Vegas to Wynn for A$370 million.
Crown then faced a new challenge, with a downturn in Chinese consumer spending crimping revenue from Chinese high-rollers at its Australian tables. Before news of the Wynn approach, its shares had fallen by a fifth since August.
Macquarie Group analysts said they needed more information to understand the benefits to Wynn, but ""given that no assets are collocated geographically, the ability to generate synergies is most likely related to corporate cost benefits and VIP"".
As well as its properties in the United States and Macau, Wynn over the past year has sought to diversify geographically to protect its growth prospects if its Macau licenses are not renewed. Already that has included ramping up promotion of a resort in Japan, a market seen as the next potential goldmine to Macau and a former expansion target for Crown.
The U.S. company has seen a series of shake-ups following sexual misconduct claims against former CEO Steve Wynn. The company's largest shareholder, Elaine Wynn, who co-founded the firm with her ex-husband, is agitating for changes on the board.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), France's third-largest bank, unveiled on Tuesday a plan to cut 1,600 jobs, mainly at its corporate and investment banking arm, in a bid to buoy profitability after last year's poor performance.
SocGen had announced it would cut 500 million euros ($563 million) in costs at its corporate and investment banking in early February after its fourth quarter results were hit by a steep market downturn, which in turn forced it to lower both profitability and revenue growth targets.
""Since early February, we have carried out a review of all the activities of corporate and investment banking. Our goal is to restore the business' profitability above the cost of capital,"" said Severin Cabannes, SocGen's deputy CEO and the head of its corporate and investment banking arm.
In February, Cabannes had admitted the cost-cutting plan would lead to job cuts at the unit which employs 18,000 people in 30 countries, but had refused to be specific until now.
The bank will cut 750 jobs in France, where all the redundancies will be made on a voluntary basis. 
The other job cuts will be carried out abroad, mainly in New York and London, where the bank may fire people.
""This news confirms that management is on a target to deliver the plan,"" wrote brokerage Jefferies.
As part of the restructuring, SocGen will stop some businesses such as proprietary trading altogether. 
""This activity never found its equilibrium or its profitability,"" Cabannes said.
The bank intends to end other businesses such as over-the-counter (OTC) commodity trading and will also reduce the size of other businesses such as its fixed-income arm. Associated jobs from support functions will also go, added Cabannes.
The bank has also decided to shut some clients off. 
""There are some clients whose profitability is structurally insufficient so we will not service them any more,"" said Cabannes. 
After years of low interest rates curtailed returns for retail banking, SocGen,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and other big European banks have relied on the more volatile earnings from corporate and investment banking with mixed results.
Although shares of other major European banks have bounced back this year, SocGen shares are still down by more than three percent amid concerns over solvency and profitability. The stock has lost more than 39 percent over the past 12 months.
SocGen's CEO Frederic Oudea is under pressure from investors. He has said the bank will sell more assets than originally planned to boost the bank's solvency ratios.
The bank expects to free up to 10 billion euros in capital as part of the reorganization plan unveiled Tuesday.

The group known as Irena revised down its estimates for global investments needed by 2050 in clean energy to meet targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Abu Dhabi-based group now says $115 trillion is needed, down from $125 trillion a year ago, reflecting lower costs to build wind and solar farms.
The global energy shift needs significant investments but they will more than pay off in curbing emissions and in health and environmental benefits, Irena’s new Director-General Francesco La Camera said by email. Green energy costs are falling rapidly, he said.
The agency cut its estimate for the additional costs needed to meet Paris Accord goals by 40 percent in the last year, according to the report. Some 174 states and the European Union signed up to the Paris deal in 2015 pledging to keep global warming from rising above 2-degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution by 2050.
The group is advocating greater use of electricity to cut the fossil-fuel emissions that are damaging the atmosphere. That would require putting 1 billion new electric cars on the road, increasing the use of power to provide heat and to make industrial gases.
Electricity’s share of total energy consumption may grow from 20 percent share now to almost 50 percent in 2050, the report said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refiners are holding back from ordering Iranian oil for loading in May pending clarity on whether Washington will extend a waiver from U.S. sanctions against the OPEC-member, four sources said.
In November, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed broad economic sanctions.
Washington, however, gave a six-month waiver to eight nations including India, allowing them to import some Iranian oil until early May. India, Iran's top oil client after China, was allowed to buy about 9 million barrels a month.
India hopes to get clarity in seven to 10 days on any extension of the waiver, as well as the amount of oil that could be purchased if an extension is given, the sources said.
""We don't know about U.S. thinking, whether they will allow India to buy oil or not,"" said one of the sources, all of whom declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Under the current waiver, India can buy about 300,000 bpd of Iranian oil - about half the amount before the sanctions were imposed - and New Delhi wants to keep buying Iranian oil at that level, Indian sources said last month.
Since November only state-run Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals have been buying Iranian oil.
State-refiners and India's oil ministry did not respond to Reuters request for comments.
Brian Hook, the special U.S. envoy for Iran, in March said Washington is pursuing its plan to bring Iranian crude exports to zero. Last week Hook said three of eight importers granted waivers by Washington have cut shipments to zero.
""Sanctions against IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) have also added to the uncertainty over supply of Iranian oil ... in the current scenario when enough alternatives are available it is better to wait for a clarity,"" said another of the sources.

Trump on Monday designated Iran's Guards a foreign terrorist organization. Iran's president Rouhani said Tehran will resist U.S. pressure and hailed IRGC as defenders of Iranians.

1257,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",Could This Be Third Time Lucky for European Bulls?: Taking Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- What a difference four years make. The last time a broad gauge of European stocks set a record high was in April 2015. At the time, David Cameron was U.K. prime minister, Donald Trump hadn’t announced his candidacy, Angela Merkel was set to become Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year,” and the Swiss National Bank had just abandoned its euro ceiling.
Fast-forward to now and the Stoxx Europe 600 is again making a run at that peak, as it did unsuccessfully in each of the past two years. This time could be different, even if we get another dip along the way. In support, the Fed has become increasingly dovish, the ECB is looking at new ways to help the economy, China is in stimulus mode and Brexit might soon find its epilogue. A vast majority of investors are underweight European equities ahead of the earnings season kicking off next week.
Europe has lagged behind other markets in a catch-up rally of a region plagued by political instability, sluggish growth and a preference for U.S. equities -- boosted by technology and fiscal measures. The rise of the euro in 2017 was also a drag and since then, the single currency has dropped significantly. Despite being cautious on European shares, Amundi strategists believe euro-zone growth should gradually recover by the end of the year, driven by household consumption.
“Valuations are less compelling, as many undervaluation gaps closed during this year’s rebound. On the other hand, the participation in the rally has been low, and this could further support the positive momentum,” the strategists write.
Market sentiment is also hinting at an increasingly bullish mood, especially for stocks, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists say, adding that any dip in the market should be bought.
It’s not an entirely rosy picture though of course. The 2019 rally has been propelled by cyclicals like miners, retail and technology -- sectors that could run out of steam after surging more than 20 percent this year. So European equities may face a few more hurdles before achieving new highs. Positive news on the political front and stronger earnings growth are needed to support further upside, Amundi strategists write, highlighting an ageing bull market.
Sylvain Goyon, head of strategy at Oddo, says that with earnings growth for 2019 expected at 5 percent and a target cost of equity of 8.45 percent, he’s struggling to see upside for the market.
“In a nutshell, I either need much more earnings-per-share growth or much lower cost of equity (below 8 percent) to create more upside,” Goyon says. “With GDP growth reverting to potential I doubt the first, while the second seems a bit aggressive.”
The technicals are also starting to look stretched. We’re reaching important resistance levels of the 2018 highs, and the market has been going in and out of overbought territory. It’s another challenge to overcome if European equities don’t want to fall at the final hurdle.
In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading down 0.1% ahead of the open.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:12AM ET</span>",Debenhams set for administration after rejecting new Ashley plan,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - British department store chain Debenhams looked set to fall into the hands of its lenders on Tuesday after it rejected a new overnight rescue plan from investor Mike Ashley in the latest twist in an acrimonious battle.
Fighting to defend his 30 percent stake before all shareholders are wiped out,  Sports Direct  (LON:SPD) boss Ashley made a midnight offer to underwrite a 200 million pound ($260 million) rights issue in exchange for him becoming CEO. 
Debenhams, once Britain's biggest department store group, rejected the offer first thing on Tuesday. It had rejected a 150 million pound rescue plan from Ashley on Monday.
The company said it was now talking to its lenders about accessing more debt but this would likely only happen if the lenders took full control of the operating assets. 
""The company anticipates making a further announcement during the course of the day following further discussions with its lenders,"" it said. Its shares were suspended before the stock market opened on Tuesday. 
Despite its long history, Debenhams has been battling for survival after a consumer shift online and to cheaper outlets destroyed 90 percent of its share value in the past year.
It currently has debt facilities worth 720 million pounds and a market valuation of 22 million pounds. 
JOBS AT RISK
The company, which had 19 million customers and 2.9 billion pounds in sales last year, has said it needs to refinance its balance sheet and restructure the business to make it more sustainable. 
It plans to close about 50 underperforming stores, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk. That would leave around 110 stores in Britain, generally large premises at the heart of the country's high streets. 
Putting the business into a so-called pre-pack administration will enable it to restructure the company more quickly. But the threat against shareholders had prompted Ashley, a high profile and unorthodox executive, to step up his campaign to wrest control of the company. 
In recent days he has demanded that Debenhams directors take lie detector tests and accused them of dishonesty. Debenhams has declined to comment or respond.
A person familiar with the situation has told Reuters that there has been a total breakdown of trust with Ashley, and that Debenhams fears that if he became CEO he would renege on his financial promise and put the company into administration himself, allowing him to select only the stores he wants to own. 
In recent months he has engineered the removal of the chairman from the company and the CEO from the board. As well as the underwritten rights issue, Sports Direct said it is still considering its options regarding the 61 million pound takeover offer it made at the end of March. It has until April 22 to make a firm offer or walk away.

Were Debenhams to go into administration it would be the latest major retailer to run into trouble in recent years after rival chain House of Fraser, electronics firm Maplin, cycle shop Evans, and Toys R Us all struggled to stay afloat.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 03:05AM ET</span>",Sony stock surges after Reuters reports Third Point re-building stake,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) shares surged more than 9 percent on Tuesday after a Reuters report saying Third Point LLC was again raising its stake in the Japanese conglomerate stoked speculation that fund owner Daniel Loeb was preparing to agitate for more change.
Third Point, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle targeting $500 million to $1 billion in capital to buy Sony shares, people familiar with the matter said.
A Sony spokesman declined to comment on the report.
Sony shares rallied 9.3 percent to a one-month high in Tokyo trade, recovering from a slump last month triggered by concern that its turnaround of recent years had lost momentum.
The electronics and entertainment conglomerate had a market value of 6.7 trillion yen ($60 billion) at Tokyo's Tuesday close.
The move would be Third Point's second campaign for change at Sony in six years, coming as investors look for the company's next profit pillar amid signs its gaming business is slowing and as its PlayStation 4 console nears the end of its lifecycle.
Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the fund believes has attracted takeover interest, the sources said.
Sony Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida sees movies, music and other intellectual property as central to stable revenue growth, having battled years of losses in consumer goods such as television sets that are more susceptible to price competition.
""I don't think a sale of the pictures business is an option for Sony now because entertainment content is becoming crucial for the company,"" Ace Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said, pointing out synergies seen in the success of action game Marvel's Spider-Man and the related movie series.
""The profit margin at Sony's pictures business is thinner than rivals, but that's a result of past management decisions, including the sale of rights to Spider-Man merchandise.""
The business is on track to recover from a series of short-term measures that cost the company long-term profit, Yasuda said.
Sony forecasts its pictures segment to report 50 billion yen in operating profit for the year ended March, less than a tenth of the estimated 870 billion yen profit for the entire company.
Sony has recently downsized or exited several television channels within the pictures segment to cut costs, while scoring blockbuster hits such as 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' and 'Venom'.

Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain on its investment after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, a call rejected by Yoshida's predecessor, Kazuo Hirai.

1262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>",Germany’s Economy Runs on Low Wages,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the German economy reverts to a slow and steady growth trend after a short-lived boom, it can rely on an unusual resource that helps to protect it from declines: A bigger low-paid workforce than even most economists realize.
Last week, Markus Grabka and Carsten Schroeder of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin reported on this phenomenon. They noted that in 2017, when the country reported near-full employment, about 9 million German workers were on low-wage contracts – that is, they earned less than two-thirds of the median hourly wage. That was 24.5 percent of all jobs, significantly more than the 18.9 percent share of low-wage workers reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for 2016. 
The share of low-wage workers, according to Grabka and Schroeder, has not declined since 2008. The percentage doesn’t include self-employed people, apprentices, trainees and people in military or alternative civilian service programs, and it means the German economic engine essentially runs on what is, for Western Europe, cheap labor. 
The median hourly wage the researchers used was 15 euros ($16.9) in 2017 – less than in 2003 but more than in 2013. The drop is largely explained by the Hartz labor reforms of the early 2000s, which were intended to get the long-term unemployed off government support and make them look for jobs. Excluding secondary employment from the calculation, the low-wage workers in Germany take in about 10.80 euros an hour; based on 35 hours a week, that’s 19,656 euros a year – less than the average wage in any OECD country except Mexico. 
Low-wage jobs make up 30 percent of primary jobs held by people with a migration background – immigrants or children of immigrants – and 33 percent of the total in Germany’s post-communist eastern states. The earning power of both immigrants and easterners is comparable to that of workers in some developing nations. That, to a large extent, is what makes Germany more affordable to live in than other wealthy European nations. It also helps fuel the country’s export dominance and huge trade surplus.
Upward mobility is low. People are stuck in the low-wage economy without much of a chance at advancement. For 27.9 percent of women, the primary job was low-wage, compared with 17 percent of men.
In recent years, Germany’s leftist political parties worked to improve the lot of the worst-paid workers. The introduction of a minimum wage in 2015, pushed through by the Social Democratic Party, the junior partner in the last two governing coalitions, increased the incomes of the poorest workers, but it hasn’t reduced the share of low-paid jobs in the economy.
Reacting to the export boom that lasted through 2017 and started deflating in the second half of 2018, the Social Democrats have demanded further improvements, calling for an end to the Hartz reforms. But the center-left party, as well as the Greens and the far-left Die Linke, which also oppose Hartz, are out of sync with the economic cycle. Germany cannot afford a less flexible labor market. And more government-decreed generosity to workers would be harmful when factory orders are shrinking and export demand is threatened by external factors such as China’s trade war with the U.S. and the Trump administration’s threats of protectionist tariffs against European goods.
It’ll take some time for German workers to realize that the window for a wage structure like those of France, Austria or the Nordic countries is closing. The threat to growth reflected in the current, dismal economic data – a 3.9 percent decline in industrial output since the May 2018 peak and a 13 percent drop in foreign orders since December – means it would be dangerous to make lasting adjustments to labor protections. During the boom, the reports of increasing national prosperity made workers hungry for change. According to the Hans Boeckler Foundation, which tracks labor protests in Germany, in 2018, more than 1 million working days were lost to strikes, up from 238,000 days in 2017, and the number of strike participants has increased to 1.2 million from 131,000. The increased activity is likely to continue until it sinks in that the good times didn’t last and companies aren’t hogging cash at workers’ expense."
1263,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:28AM ET</span>",How Wells Fargo's regulators and employees drove out its CEO,"By Imani Moise and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The day after former  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan told U.S. lawmakers he was transforming the bank's high-pressure culture, Federal Reserve officials met privately with bank employees. 
At the meeting on March 13, which has not been previously reported, Fed officials were told by four bank employees that little had changed within the bank's culture since the scandal that engulfed Wells Fargo almost three years ago.
Among those present at the meeting was Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who is overseeing a decree requiring that Wells Fargo fix its risk management before it can resume growing, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The employees belonged to an advocacy group, Committee For Better Banks, which confirmed the meeting. 
Brainard told the group she was there to listen and get insight into the mood among Wells Fargo staff but declined to say if or how the Fed would respond, the sources said.
While regulators occasionally meet with consumer advocacy or industry groups, it is unusual for a Fed board member to meet with an individual firm's employees. It is not clear who asked for the meeting. 
Sloan abruptly departed the bank last month, making him the second CEO to leave Wells Fargo in the wake of its sales practice scandal. Sloan, who declined to comment on this story through a representative, has previously said he stepped down because he felt the external attention on him had become a distraction.
His departure was at least partly the result of the board's conclusion that Sloan had failed to convince regulators that he could transform the bank and rally a staff that had low confidence in its leadership, according to a source with knowledge of the board's thinking.
Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on regulatory matters but disputed the employee group's characterization of the bank's culture.
Sloan's struggles underscore the challenges faced by the bank's next chief executive. They will not only have to transform the bank and its sales practices, but also persuade regulators and its 260,000 employees that they have done so.
Finding a new CEO who can win over the bank's employees is as important as finding someone who can charm regulators and Wall Street, said Russell Raath, president of management consulting firm Kotter.
""The whole bank needs to know that this person cares about their contribution to the top and bottom line,” he said.
STRAINED RELATIONSHIP 
Wells Fargo's relationship with regulators has been strained since 2016, when employee whistleblowers revealed the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. 
Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in the bank's businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.
In February 2018, Wells Fargo signed a Fed consent order that required the bank to fix its risk-management and governance problems before it could grow its balance sheet. 
Two months later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo's other key regulator, ordered the bank to make similar fixes and repay customers to whom it had improperly sold mortgages and auto insurance.
In December, Reuters reported that the Fed had rejected the bank's initial remediation plan, putting it behind schedule. Days later, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the Fed would not lift the asset cap until it was satisfied that Wells Fargo had fixed its risk problems.
LOW MORALE
An internal company-wide survey around that time also pointed to low morale, according to the Committee For Better Banks and other Wells Fargo employees. 
The bank internally published a write-up about the survey, saying Wells Fargo found itself at a ""challenging and interesting"" crossroads. Some employees felt that the description sugar-coated the findings, sources said. 
That sparked dozens of comments from workers criticizing management for being out of touch, according to the sources and screenshots of the internal site reviewed by Reuters. 
A consumer loan underwriter complained on the internal site that the concerns about pay and employee benefits were falling on deaf ears. 
""For years (team members) have been expressing their concerns and frustrations,"" the employee wrote. ""The only response (if any) are canned answers and talking points which we all know is baloney.""
An analysis of the survey Wells Fargo published publicly showed only 38 percent of employees felt senior management understood obstacles faced by frontline workers. 
Wells Fargo’s Folk said the company seeks and values input from employees, and that the bank has already made a number of improvements based on the feedback. 
He pointed to other categories in the survey that showed employees believed in the bank's values and were satisfied. For example, 72 percent of employees said they believe Wells Fargo is a good place to work.
REGULATORY REBUKE
Sloan testified before Congress on March 12 in a hearing about the bank's progress since 2016. 
As a gesture of goodwill, Wells Fargo took the unusual step of offering the OCC the opportunity to review his testimony in advance, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It is unclear how the OCC responded. 
In his testimony, Sloan detailed Wells Fargo's extensive transformation efforts, but regulators remained skeptical.
Sloan had barely finished speaking when the OCC said it was still ""disappointed"" by the bank's remediation efforts. 
The next day, after Wells Fargo disclosed Sloan had gotten a 5 percent pay raise, the Fed responded that it expects boards ""to hold management accountable."" 
A week later, Powell told reporters the bank had suffered a ""remarkably widespread series of breakdowns"" that needed to be addressed in a ""fundamental"" way.
These rebukes undermined Sloan's position at the bank, the source with knowledge of the board's thinking said.
On March 26, Sloan told the board he had decided to resign, according to a regulatory filing. Three days later, he publicly stepped down.

1264,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>",Sweet-Toothed Millennials Lure a Giant Sugar Player to China,"(Bloomberg) -- One of Asia’s biggest sugar refiners is in talks to sell the sweetener in China, seduced by the country’s “new generation” of consumers.
MSM Malaysia Holdings Bhd. is nearing the final stages of discussions to set up partnerships in China’s downstream sugar industry, Executive Director Khairil Anuar Aziz said. The refiner is looking to sell sugar for popular snacks such as bubble tea, health drinks and bread, as well as healthier sweeteners, condensed milk and molasses used in alcohol.
There’s “opportunity if you really blend it with the current lifestyle of people” in China, Khairil said in an interview at the company headquarters in Kuala Lumpur last week. “We really want to provide sugar to all these different industries -- bakeries, bubble tea, healthy drinks. The demand is there.”
MSM’s wager on China follows a tumultuous time for the global sugar market, which has been one of the worst performers in recent years. The more-than 40 percent plunge in futures in the past two years has hurt firms from Germany’s Suedzucker AG to major Singaporean food trader Olam International Ltd. MSM hasn’t gone unscathed, with dwindling sales leading to a quarterly loss and shares tumbling to a record low on Monday. MSM shares in Kuala Lumpur rose as much as 4.7 percent to 1.77 ringgit ($0.43) on Tuesday.
Sweet Outlook
MSM is hoping China can help turn things around. The refiner, the world’s sixth largest for standalone capacity at 2.25 million metric tons per year, sees China as Asia’s next biggest sugar market as the younger generation become increasingly busy and pick up easy-to-eat sugary snacks on the go.
Consumption in China is forecast to rise to more than 15 million tons in the year ending September 2019, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, while the OECD sees the country becoming the world’s top sugar importer by 2027.
The Chinese are also munching more snacks, helping drive sugar usage. Euromonitor International sees snack consumption expanding by 13 percent to 13.5 million tons by 2023 from this year.
MSM expects sugar prices to improve in the second half of 2019 as the global glut moves to a deficit, albeit a small one. Raw sugar for export may average 14 cents a pound this year, as Brazil converts more of the commodity into ethanol and crop-unfriendly weather in some Indian producing regions cuts supplies, Khairil said. Sugar in New York was at 12.68 cents on Monday.
Recovering prices, as well as forecasts for a stronger Malaysian ringgit, should help MSM shore up cash for new investments, Khairil said.
“We’re looking for the market to balance out,” Khairil said. “A deficit in global raw sugar will give us a little breather.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese game-streaming company Huya Inc, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, has launched a follow-on share offering of about $343 million to raise funds for investment in its content and e-sports partners.
Huya, which went public last year in New York, is part of a growing trend of Chinese tech companies returning to capital markets for cash soon after their initial public offering (IPO).
Huya is selling 13.6 million primary shares, the game-streaming firm company said in a stock exchange filing. At the same time, social media platform YY Inc is selling 4.8 million of Huya shares, the filing showed.
Based on its closing price of $25.23 on Monday, the combined sale could raise as much as $464 million.
There is an over-allotment - or greenshoe option - of up to 15 percent for Huya's share sale, meaning the firm could raise as much as $394 million if exercised. There is likewise a 15 percent over-allotment for YY's stake sale.
Huya is China's biggest live-streaming game platform, according to the offering prospectus, competing with Douyu which plans to go public in New York this year.
China boasts the world's largest gamer base in e-sports with about 266 million gamers in 2018, the prospectus showed.
Huya's shares have risen about 65 percent since the firm's IPO in May, in which it raised $180 million.
Other companies from the 2018 IPO cohort returning for more funds include electric vehicle maker NIO Inc, video streaming company iQIYI Inc, e-commerce firm Pinduoduo Inc and video platform Bilibili Inc.
Bankers are pinning their hopes for 2019 on additional capital raising through follow-on offerings or convertible bonds as the crop of Chinese companies looking to go public thins out after a blockbuster 2018 in terms of IPOs.
Many of the companies that went public in 2018 raised less money than they had hoped for - partly due to global market jitters and partly because investors pushed back against lofty valuations - which will drive follow-on capital raising.
Huya will price its follow-on offering after New York markets close on Tuesday.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies are joint bookrunners for the deal.

The SCMP attributed its information to comments from CALC Chairman Chen Shuang. The Hong Kong-listed lessor said Chen was misquoted.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after nearly 350 people died in crashes in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month.
Boeing has also frozen deliveries of the 737 MAX planes as aviation authorities investigate the causes behind both disasters, with the company so far saying that an erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software was ""a common link"" between the two.
The Hong Kong-based newspaper later on Tuesday updated its story to quote CALC Chief Executive Mike Poon as saying the company had not stopped payment, but as deliveries were on hold, it did not need to make any payment for the time being. 
A spokeswoman for CALC told Reuters that Poon was referring to Boeing's overall suspension of deliveries to airlines.
""Our company currently does not have plans to change our Boeing aircraft orders,"" she said. She added that CALC's first Boeing 737 MAX delivery, initially scheduled for the third quarter of this year, could be delayed due to the suspension.
The Hong Kong-listed lessor, controlled by state-owned conglomerate China Everbright Group Co Ltd, placed an order for 50 737 MAX aircraft in June 2017 and later expanded the order.
A Boeing spokesman on Tuesday said the plane maker was focused on supporting customers and to ensure the 737 MAX's return to commercial flight.

""China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings has been and continues to be a valued customer and we are sorry for any disruption this situation has caused them,"" the spokesman said.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 10:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Standard Chartered expected to pay just over $1 billion to resolve U.S., U.K. probes","By Karen Freifeld
NEW YORK (Reuters) - London-based  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) is expected to pay slightly more than $1 billion to resolve a nearly five-year-old investigation of potential U.S. sanctions violations tied to its banking for Iran-controlled entities in Dubai, as well as a related U.K. probe, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Authorities are aiming for the bank to settle on Tuesday morning, two sources said.
Standard Chartered has been operating under deferred prosecution agreements with U.S. authorities since 2012, when it paid $667 million for illegally moving millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on behalf of customers in Iran, Sudan, Libya and Burma.   
The agreement has been extended numerous times, the last one extended for 10 days and set to expire on Wednesday.
The expected total payout also covers a roughly $134 million penalty from Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority related to historical financial crime controls. 
Standard Chartered declined to comment. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, the Federal Reserve, the Manhattan District Attorney and the New York Department of Financial Services all declined to comment. The FCA also declined to comment.
The latest U.S. investigation stems in part from evidence found during a probe of French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), which paid a record $8.9 billion in penalties and pleaded guilty in 2014 to sanctions-related charges, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.
Investigators found BNP had done business with a Dubai-registered corporation that acted as a front for an Iranian entity, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters in 2014. Investigators said the company also once had an account with Standard Chartered, the person said.
Two former Standard Chartered bankers operating out of Dubai also have been under scrutiny for possible misconduct and could face criminal charges in the probe, another person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. 
Standard Chartered said in February it had set aside $900 million related to the potential resolution of violations of U.S. sanctions and foreign exchange trading. That sum also included the FCA penalty. The bank settled the foreign exchange probe in February when it was fined $40 million by New York's banking regulator for attempting to rig transactions between 2007 and 2013. 
A resolution of the FCA probe is expected at the same time as the U.S. settlements.
In its annual report, Standard Chartered said the latest U.S. investigation is focused on the extent to which conduct and control failures allowed clients with Iranian interests to conduct transactions through the bank between 2007 and 2014.

Other banks to settle with U.S. authorities over sanctions-related misconduct in the past decade include  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Lloyds (LON:LLOY),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and HSBC.

1269,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Manager Who Bet on India Mini-Lehman Moment Likes Non-Bank Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s top-performing local corporate bond fund is making another contrarian bet after its decision to buy notes during last year’s liquidity squeeze in the market paid off.
DSP Investment Managers’ corporate bond fund is adding to holdings of debt from non-banks even as the shock defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., sometimes called India’s mini-Lehman moment, still hang over the sector’s debt. Those notes offer higher yield premiums than publicly owned companies.
The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday cut interest rates for a second time this year in the face of headwinds to the economy at home and abroad. While non-bank lenders and housing finance companies have struggled to find buyers for their debt since the IL&FS crisis, overseas investors such as Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP have seized the opportunity to make acquisitions in India’s mortgage financing market.
“When the economy is exposed to the problem of cost of money, the growth trajectory tends to slow down, which often indicates the turn of the interest-rate cycle,” said Saurabh Bhatia, head of fixed income at DSP Investment Managers, in an interview last week. “These become opportune times as you benefit from higher yields without diluting the credit or duration profile of the portfolio,” according to Bhatia, who oversees 380 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) in assets.
DSP’s company bond fund was the top performer among 17 rupee corporate note funds in the last six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It returned 6.91 percent in the period, compared with an average performance of 5.53 percent, the data show.
Bhatia’s firm started the DSP Corporate Bond Fund in early September when yields on short-term debt surged to about 9 percent after IL&FS’s defaults.
The yield on AAA-rated non-bank five-year bonds climbed five basis points to 8.53 percent last week, still 11 basis points above the average during the past five years, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. It’s also above the average yield for all five-year AAA Indian corporate bonds by about 40 basis points.
DSP Investment Managers is part of the DSP group, a Mumbai-based financial services firm which started a stock broker business in the 1860s, according to the company’s website.

1270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",M&A Fever Has Yet to Break in the Gulf,"(Bloomberg) -- From Dubai’s Burj Khalifa to Kuwait’s Al Hamra Tower, oil-rich Gulf economies built up their skylines in a hurry in the few years preceding the financial crisis. Now, as the price of the region’s most precious commodity languishes, a similarly frantic pace is on to merge some of the region’s banking and industrial behemoths.
Banks across the Gulf are leading a record wave of mergers and acquisitions as governments look for ways to stay competitive and battle slow growth. About a dozen lenders are involved in mergers or takeovers. The flow of deals has been gathering speed ever since the megamerger between two of Abu Dhabi’s largest banks in 2017 and the combination of three of the emirate’s investment firms that was completed last year.
In Saudi Arabia, the first bank merger in 20 years is under way, as well as what’s set to be the kingdom’s largest M&A deal: the acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (Sabic) by Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco) from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. This follows Saudi International Petrochemical Co.’s agreement last year to acquire Sahara Petrochemical Co. in an all-share deal valued at about $2 billion.
Surging oil prices over more than a decade helped many Gulf states—which include the world’s biggest exporters of crude and liquefied natural gas—expand aggressively at home and abroad. After crude prices nosedived in 2014, countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar pulled the plug on spending. Over the course of the first quarter of this year, the price of crude has settled at a level that’s barely high enough for Gulf Arab monarchies to balance their budgets. Governments—which play a significant role in M&A decision-making in the region—have set this recent consolidation frenzy into motion to make the financial sector more competitive. Abu Dhabi, which sits on 6 percent of global oil reserves, has been particularly keen on consolidation.
While the 2014 oil crash “didn’t prompt M&A activity immediately, it did spark a broader appraisal of spending and profitability of partially and fully state-owned entities,” says Allison Wood, Middle East and North Africa analyst at Control Risks Group Holdings Ltd., a strategy firm. “It also made governments and companies more attuned to the potential longer-term benefits of merging with or acquiring other entities to give them an advantage in key markets.”
Overbanked
There’s almost no sector in the region that isn’t affected by oil. Most banks, for instance, are heavily reliant on government deposits, which have been dwindling in sync with crude prices. Lenders have also faced damped demand for credit and weakened loan performance as governments cut spending after oil’s slump.
Yet a bearish oil market isn’t the only driver behind this M&A spurt. The Gulf region is also heavily overbanked, with about 70 listed institutions serving a population of roughly 50 million, putting smaller lenders under pressure. As a rough comparison, there are only about a dozen listed banks in the U.K., a country of about 65 million people. Most lenders in the Gulf Cooperation Council member nations are at least partly owned by arms of their national governments, making consolidation easier. The restructuring is part of the GCC states’ larger plan to make their economies less dependent on crude as a source of long-term growth.
The recent merger mania in the U.A.E. banking sector follows a relatively quiet decade for such deals. The U.A.E.’s first bank merger, in 2007, brought together Emirates Bank International PJSC and National Bank of Dubai PJSC. The combined entity, Emirates NBD PJSC, has more than trebled its profit since then, while net income has increased at a compound annual rate of 11 percent from 2008 to 2018 despite some turbulent years after the global financial crisis. In 2017 the consolidation of Abu Dhabi’s largest lenders—First Gulf Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi—created the region’s second-largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC, and has since prompted a flurry of talks among competitors. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC is in the process of merging with Union National Bank PJSC and Al Hilal Bank. Abu Dhabi is considering combining Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC with First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC to create the Middle East’s largest lender, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
In Saudi Arabia,  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s local unit is close to acquiring Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc’s local venture in a $5 billion stock deal, while the kingdom’s biggest lender, National Commercial Bank, started initial talks late last year with Riyad Bank for a merger. In Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman, merger talks are also under way among banks.
“The catalyst for what we are seeing now was the impact of lower oil prices, which squeezed liquidity in the banking sector and put pressure on profitability,” says Redmond Ramsdale, head of GCC banks at Fitch Ratings. “The most obvious way to increase shareholder value is to create market leaders, or strong players in the market, who are in a better position to compete for deposits and find growth opportunities.”
Sovereign funds
Banks aren’t the only entities that are merging. Last year, Abu Dhabi combined Mubadala and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council to create a wealth fund with about $230 billion in assets, just a year after Mubadala merged with International Petroleum Investment Co., another government-backed investment firm.
After pushing back its much-anticipated initial public offering to 2021, Saudi Aramco agreed last month to buy 70 percent of petrochemical giant Sabic from the Public Investment Fund, in a deal worth about $70 billion. It would give the PIF, as the sovereign fund is known, the financial firepower it needs to carry out ambitious investment plans at home and abroad as Aramco’s own share sale stalls.
“We see globally, and certainly in the region, a pursuit of improved performance as the outlook turns less optimistic,” says Miguel Azevedo,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s regional investment banking head. “We also see as quite possible that large industrial groups team up and potentially engage in M&A with other strategic players, always as a tool to improve performance in a more challenging economic environment.”
Growth outlook
While the price of oil has rallied about 25 percent this year through mid-March, the Gulf’s biggest economies remain a long way off the growth rates reached before the 2014 oil crash. Efforts by OPEC and its allies to curb a global glut mean they won’t benefit as much from an improving outlook for crude. Consumer demand also remains sluggish. Saudi Arabia suffered the deepest growth revision among major economies in the International Monetary Fund’s latest projections for this year, matched only by Germany.
Shareholder attitudes toward M&A are also changing. With each successful deal, governments and companies are becoming more comfortable with the idea of consolidation. “The recent track record of M&A transactions is creating a strong set of precedents in the region for regulators to lean on, and for potential merging companies to replicate,” says Karim Tannir, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s head of investment banking in the Middle East and North Africa. “The more transactions the region will witness in the short to medium term, the easier it will be to encourage public and private companies to consider the M&A route as a path for growth.”

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 08:37PM ET</span>","Uber, ahead of IPO, sees some time before self-driving cars dominate the road","By Alessandra Galloni and Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc expects it will be a long time before one of its biggest investments, self-driving cars, is ready for wide-scale deployment, a senior scientist said on Monday, as the ride-sharing firm gears up to go public. 
Raquel Urtasun, who is chief scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and heads the group's unit in Toronto, spoke about the challenges for self-driving development at a Reuters Newsmaker https://www.reuters.com/newsmakers event in New York. 
""Self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet,"" Urtasun said. ""To have it at scale is going to take a long time.""
The more cautious tone marks a change from three years ago, when Uber embraced aggressive tactics to turbocharge its autonomous vehicle development in a bid to get more robot taxis on the street driving more miles. The company had been seen as an industry leader in the technology until one of its autonomous SUVs killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March last year.
Urtasun's comments fall in line with the rest of the self-driving industry, which after much hype and bold promises has tempered expectations and pushed out timelines for deployment. The extreme technical challenges of building cars that can predict human behavior and respond appropriately proved greater than even some of the industry's brightest minds had anticipated.
The progress of Uber's self-driving car unit is in the spotlight as the company prepares to kick off its initial public offering this year. Uber, whose losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion last year, has at times spent close to $200 million in a single quarter on its self-driving unit, sources told Reuters.
Uber, last valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion in its IPO and may kick off its investor roadshow before the end of April, Reuters has reported.
""It is true that when you go to an IPO, there is much more of a look into your finances,"" said Urtasun. ""That being said, again because Uber understands that self-driving cars at scale is not something that's going to happen tomorrow, they understand the need for the science."" 
Urtasun declined to offer any guidance on what mix of human-driven cars and autonomous cars Uber will have in the next 10 years, citing too many uncertainties in the industry.
""What is clear is that in a 10-year timeframe there will be a mix of both (self-driving and human-controlled cars),"" she said. 
UBER SEEKING PARTNERS
The business of building self-driving cars is extraordinarily expensive and the timeframe to payoff is increasingly uncertain. However, some consider Uber's ability to successfully navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles as crucial to the company's long-term financial prospects. 
By removing drivers and adding automation, Uber will be able to pocket the full fare that passengers pay and create more efficient routes to move around people and packages.
Uber opened ATG in Toronto in 2017 and named Urtasun, who is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto, as head of the Toronto organization. Uber said last year it would invest more than $150 million in Toronto to grow its self-driving car operations, open an engineering hub and expand its work in artificial intelligence. 
After the fatal Arizona crash, Uber removed its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its testing hub. Uber resumed very limited testing on public roads in Pittsburgh in December. 
Uber has recently taken a more collaborative approach, inviting General Motor Co's self-driving car unit Cruise and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo to put their cars on Uber's ride-hailing network. Urtasun said on Monday that Uber encouraged every self-driving company to add their cars to the Uber network. 
""We've been very, very open that we would like every other company to be in our (autonomous vehicle) network,"" said Urtasun. 
A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp are in talks to invest $1 billion or more into Uber's self-driving vehicle unit, Reuters reported last month.
Toyota previously invested $500 million to jointly develop self-driving cars with Uber.

1272,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",Traders Spooked as African Swine Fever Keeps Spreading,"(Bloomberg) -- The relentless proliferation of African swine fever on farms in East Asia is sending shivers through the region’s livestock industry, with more than a million hogs culled since the disease first appeared in August, and that’s just according to official tallies.
Demand for soybean meal, an essential ingredient for animal feed, is expected to shrink in China for the first time in more than a decade after the sickness spread to almost the entire country. The nation is the world’s biggest hog producer and top importer of soybeans. In Vietnam, the virus has reached 23 provinces and cities, while about 10 percent of the herd in Mongolia has perished or been destroyed since January. Thailand is keeping a close vigil after cases were reported in neighboring Cambodia.
The deadly pig illness has the potential to further depress soymeal futures in China, which have already slumped 25 percent from an October high. Shrinking hog herds and heavy economic losses for farmers may scar the business for years to come. A recent outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in China’s northeast only adds to their plight. Still, one person’s loss is another’s gain as hog futures in Chicago have soared on optimism over import demand from China.
“The problem we have now is that no one really wants to restock and make that investment for fear of getting hit again,” said Darin Friedrichs, Risk Management Consultant in INTL FCStone’s Asia commodities division. It’s difficult for the market to get an accurate assessment of the damage, he said, as some outbreaks haven’t been reported.
Supply and demand for hogs is basically balanced short term, but supply is going to tighten and that’s set to continue for a long time, according to the Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Bureau of China’s Shandong province. Farmers are selling pigs at a faster pace and not replenishing stocks, it said. The country has more than 400 million pigs, and pork is the principal source of dietary protein.
China’s soymeal demand may drop more than 5 percent to 66 million metric tons in 2018-19, the first contraction after 11 years of growth, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Center. Still, consumption in other segments may curb the decline. Use in poultry, fisheries and donkey breeding has increased, particularly in the northern province of Hebei, said Li Xinxin, a soymeal trader at a Chinese crushing plant.
The situation could worsen as the virus spreads to new provinces in countries such as Vietnam. The country has culled more than 73,000 infected pigs since the virus was first found at the start of February, Tien Phong newspaper reported, citing data from the agriculture ministry’s animal health department. The government has announced preventive and control measures to protect a pig population that totals almost 30 million.
The livestock feed industry in Vietnam relies almost entirely on imported soymeal, with the country buying 4.8 million tons from overseas last year, according to Nguyen Quoc Dat, vice head of the Vietnam Animal Husbandry Association. If swine fever stays under control, purchases from abroad this year may be little changed, Dat said.
Some countries are on a high alert. Thailand stepped up surveillance after Taiwan authorities reported finding pork products from Vietnam tainted with swine fever, according to Sorawit Thaneeto, director general of the Department of Livestock Development. The virus was also detected in Chinese pork products at airports from Japan to Australia, spurring country bans.
The most virulent form of the disease can be 100 percent lethal for pigs and wild boars, and there’s no vaccine.

Boston-based ClimaCell Inc. will use the investment from SB Energy, a wholly owned unit of the Japanese conglomerate, to speed deployment of its “microweather” system, the forecasting company said in a statement Monday.
The investment comes as electrical grids grapple with implications of mounting wind and solar power. Both resources are among the cheapest sources of electricity available but are vulnerable to changes in the weather. That’s a problem when weather forecasts are wrong.
“The reason that we have troubling weather forecasts is that we’re using old technology,” ClimaCell Chief Executive Officer Shimon Elkabetz said in an interview.
ClimaCell closed $45 million Series B funding round last year, led by Clearvision Ventures. It was founded in 2015.

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 06:20PM ET</span>",Former ISS marketing manager turns corporate governance consultant,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - A former Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) marketing manager who was not directly involved in making the influential advisory firm's voting recommendations is now working as a consultant advising clients on how ISS is likely to vote.
Anna Bryan, who worked at ISS until last year, advised Loop Capital Markets last month that activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP would likely win a proxy contest at retailer  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR), where it sought to replace a majority of directors.
Loop Capital, a Chicago brokerage, wrote in a client note that, following a discussion with Bryan, it reiterated its Dollar Tree ""buy"" rating and raised its price target to $115 per share. The note, which was disseminated to Loop Capital clients, was seen by Reuters.
""We left the call (with Bryan) feeling confident that Starboard Value would likely prevail in a proxy contest,"" Loop Capital wrote in the March 8 note, noting that Bryan has ""extensive proxy advisory experience."" 
The prediction did not pan out. Starboard dropped its board challenge against Dollar Tree on Friday, saying that it was pleased with the company's decision to test multiple price points at its stores. Dollar Tree shares on Monday closed down 3.3 percent at $102.44.
Bryan never served as a research analyst producing ISS recommendations. Instead, she worked in the global marketing and communications department between 2014 and 2018, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile and ISS sources. 
Bryan, who describes herself on her Linkedin page as an investor relations consultant and sustainability expert, declined to comment on her involvement in the Loop Capital recommendation. Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba did not respond to requests for comment.
Bryan's case illustrates the strong appetite among investors for insight into ISS's thinking, turning former employees who were even tangentially involved in ISS's recommendations into sought-after experts. 
It also underscores the sway of Rockville, Maryland-based ISS, which informs the votes of roughly 1,400 institutional investors. Its influence was on display two weeks ago, when Starboard abandoned its campaign to urge investors to block drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's $74 billion deal to buy  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) hours after ISS came out in support of the merger.
As a result, ISS staffers have become coveted recruitment targets. Two former heads of ISS's special situations research group for example, Chris Young and Chris Cernich, moved to Wall Street long ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.32%, the S&P 500 edged up 0.10%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) plunged more than 4.4% after Bank of America downgraded its rating on the company to neutral from buy and cut its price target on the stock to $420 from $480 on expectations that production delays of the 737 Max jet will hurt margins and free cash flow. Boeing shares are down 16% since peaking at $446.01 on March 1.
The bank said it expects production of the 737 Max jet to be delayed by six to nine months. Boeing on Friday said it will cut its production of the 737 Max jets by nearly a fifth to 42 a month from its original target of 52.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), both of which count the 737 Max among their fleets, ended the day lower, pressured by expectations that the grounding off the 737 Max could last through the peak summer travel season. American Airlines was off 0.5%. Southwest, historically the largest buyer of 737 planes, dropped 2.5%.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) also added to weak sentiment, falling 5.2% after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $5 from $6, saying ""many investors are underestimating the severity of the challenges and underlying risks at GE, while overestimating the value of small positives.""
The bearish calls from Wall Street on Boeing and General Electric come just days ahead of the start of first-quarter earnings, which many fear will prove to be one of the most challenging in recent quarters.
First-quarter earnings are now expected to decline 4.2% year over year for S&P 500 companies, according to FactSet, compared to a 3.9% decline forecasted just one week ago.

1279,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. JOLTs Data Due
Following up from last week’s employment report, the market will get the lagest figures from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs).
The Labor Department will release its February JOLTs report at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that job openings fell to 7.55 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 6:00 AM ET, the NFIB small business optimism index is released.
Economists predict that the index ticked down slightly to 101.3 in March.
2. Oil Hits 5-Month High, API on Tap
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data, which showed a surprise build last week, will likely come under scrutiny on Tuesday, as some have blamed a well supplied domestic market for keeping a lid on gains in U.S. oil prices.
WTI futures hit a five-month high today, settling at $64.40, but has lagged the move in Brent crude as the U.S. remains ""well supplied with its own production,"" said Fiona Cincotta at City Index.
Oil prices have racked up gains as fears over a glut in global supplies have eased somewhat following expectations for supply disruptions in Libya as fighting has intensified. There are also hopes that OPEC will agree to extend its production-cut accord.
""I think we are getting to a point where inventories are starting to stabilize, but they are still above what I would call a normal level,"" Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Monday during the Gulf Intelligence Forum in Riyadh.
Falih also touted Asia as a hotspot for medium-term oil demand growth.
""The underlying drivers for oil will be there, (with) people moving from rural to big cities, that's not going to be dented significantly by GDP growth,"" he added.
3. WD-40 to Report Results
It’s not the biggest company for investors, but almost everyone deals with it.
WD-40 (NASDAQ:WDFC) reports fiscal second-quarter earnings Tuesday morning and analysts polled by Investing.com are expecting $1.12 a share, up from $1.05 a year ago. Revenue is projected at $104.1 million, up 3.1% a year ago. WD-40 is best-known for the eponymous product everyone sprays on hard-to-loosen nuts and bolts and the like.
Technically, WD-40 makes maintenance products, and the company says, “We live under the sinks, in the garages and in the toolboxes of the world.” In fact, WD-40 is sold in some 176 countries through mass retail and home center stores, warehouse club stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, sport retailers, independent bike dealers, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers.
The San Diego company’s shares are down 7.4% this year as of Monday’s close, but they were up 55% in 2018 and even hit a 52-week high of $187.50 on Dec. 24, a day the stock market was cratering."
1280,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Loeb's Third Point building stake to pressure Sony - sources,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC is building a stake in Sony Corp (T:6758) to push for changes that include shedding some businesses, the second time in six years it has targeted the Japanese electronics maker, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Once a market leader in consumer electronics, Sony is now in the midst of a turnaround effort spearheaded by Kenichiro Yoshida, its chief executive who formerly served at its chief financial officer.
The maker of the iconic Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007. Sony over the past decade has reinvented itself as an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and its video game platform.
Investors are now searching for its next source of growth as Sony's gaming business shows signs of slowing, with its popular PlayStation 4 console nearing the end of its cycle.
Third Point's amassed stake in Sony thus far could not be learned. The hedge fund, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle, targeting between $500 million and $1 billion in capital, so it can buy more Sony shares, the sources said.
Third Point wants Sony to explore options for some of its business units, including its movie studio, which the hedge fund believes has attracted takeover interest from the likes of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), the sources said. The hedge fund also wants clarity on how Sony's semiconductor and insurance divisions fit in with the rest of the company, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sony and Third Point declined to comment.
U.S.-listed shares of Sony rose 8.3 percent after the Reuters report to close at $46.65. The company, whose main stock market listing is in Tokyo, has a market value of 6.1 trillion yen ($55 billion).
Sony reported lower-than-expected profit in February, dragged down by its previously thriving gaming business, even as a one-off gain related to its acquisition of music publisher EMI pushed the quarterly result to a record high.
Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off its entertainment division, writing in a letter to investors that the division remained ""poorly managed.""
Some Hollywood actors and producers rallied behind Sony at the time, with actor and producer George Clooney calling Loeb ""a hedge fund guy who describes himself as an activist but who knows nothing about our business.""
Later Loeb changed his tune, praising the company for cutting costs at the entertainment division and having made management changes.
CINEMA HITS
Sony has already sold off its ailing personal computer division and streamlined its television and smartphone businesses. In taking aim at Sony's commitment to the entertainment business, however, Third Point may be facing an uphill struggle. 
Yoshida has said he sees synergies between the film business and its PlayStation platform, and he has been emboldened by Sony's cinema hits such as 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,' and 'Venom'. 
Consolidation in the sector has been intensifying amid pressure from online streaming services offered by companies like Netflix and Amazon, and with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co completing its $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox Inc's entertainment assets from Rupert Murdoch's media empire last month. 
Loeb is no stranger to challenging companies with long odds of success. Last year, he sought to oust the entire board of Campbell Soup Co, despite the founding family's members controlling much of the U.S. food company. He ended up settling for two board seats.
This is the second time Third Point is looking to increase its firepower by raising a special purpose vehicle. In 2017, it raised $750 million that way to build a stake in Nestle SA (SIX:NESN). 

Sony last month said its chairman Kazuo Hirai, who helped engineer the company's recent revival, would retire in June.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged into positive territory on Monday, with gains held in check by falling industrials as investors braced for what analysts now expect to be the first quarter of contracting earnings since 2016. 
While the Dow ended the session lower, the S&P 500 extended its winning streak. The benchmark index has now seen eight straight days of gains for the first time since October 2017. 
""We've been in an expansion for a long time, this is late-cycle mentality,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minneapolis. ""Typically, we see equities perform well toward the end of the cycle."" 
First-quarter reporting period begins in earnest, with Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co results due this week. 
Analysts expect it to be the first quarter to show a year-on-year decline in S&P 500 earnings since 2016. January-March profits for S&P 500 companies are seen contracting by 2.3% from last year, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors are also grappling with increasing signs of a global economic slowdown.
""On the top of investors' minds is the slowing growth narrative and whether the economy is headed to recession,"" Ripley added. ""We'll get an idea as earnings come in from various sectors.""
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co was the heaviest drag on the blue-chip Dow, falling 4.4% after the company said it would cut production of its 737 MAX aircraft in response to a worldwide grounding of the jets after the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10. 
Boeing woes also weighed on the plane maker's suppliers. Spirit AeroSystems and Triumph Group ended the session down 5.1% and 6.2%, respectively.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.97 points, or 0.32%, to 26,341.02, the S&P 500 gained 3.03 points, or 0.10%, to 2,895.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.19 points, or 0.19%, to 7,953.88.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six closed in the black, led by energy which got a boost from rising crude prices.
Utilities and industrials were the biggest percentage losers. 
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) dropped 5.2% after JPMorgan downgraded the industrial conglomerate's stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral."" 
New Age Beverage Corp shot up 38.6% on news that it would expand its tea and coffee brand Marley with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
 Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) gained 3.6% following RBC Capital Markets' upgrade of the stock to ""outperform.""
Drugmaker Histogenics Corp soared 56.0% on news it would merge with privately-held Ocugen Inc.
Chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) dipped 1.0% after Cowen downgraded the stock to ""market perform,"" citing expected margin pressures.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 29 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.15 billion shares, compared to the 7.28 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1288,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Saudis Reemerge From Khashoggi Crisis With $60 Billion Aramco Bond Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, has received $60 billion in orders for its debut bond sale, kickstarting an offering with yields likely to fall in line or below Saudi Arabia’s sovereign debt.
It’s rare for bonds of a state-owned company to yield less than the sovereign debt and the demand reflects intense investor appetite for high-quality paper. For Saudi Arabia and Aramco itself, the early success in selling the bonds marks a tremendous turnaround after investors, Wall Street bankers and corporate titans briefly shunned the kingdom last year following the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The crisis, along with sliding crude prices, hit the kingdom late last year and in early 2019, with the economy slowing down and investors taking money out of the local stock market. Now, the situation appears to be reversing, helped by oil rising to more than $70 a barrel, up from $50 in December.
As part of its debut in the global debt market, Aramco has offered bonds in six portions, from three to 30 years, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.
The company expects to pay about 1.25 percentage points more than U.S. Treasuries for its 10-year notes, compared with Saudi bonds trading at about 1.27 percentage points, the banks selling the debt told investors. Traditionally, those risk premiums fall in a high-demand bond sale as the process advances, suggesting Aramco may pay even less.
Aramco is likely to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion, with final pricing and size expected on Tuesday afternoon London time.
The Aramco deal is one of the most hotly anticipated debt deals of the year, marking the first time the Saudi oil giant has tapped the international bond market. When Qatar, a rival Middle East nation, sold $12 billion in bonds earlier this year, it got a record $50 billion in orders, evidence of investor appetite for debt of rich, oil-producing nations.
The order book for Aramco expanded from about $40 billion when the deal kicked off earlier Monday, people with knowledge of the deal said.
The deal is largely seen as Plan B to raise money for the country’s economic agenda after the initial public offering of Aramco, which had been slated for 2018, was postponed until at least 2021. In effect, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is using the company’s pristine balance sheet to finance his ambitions.
Aramco has lined up a roster of international investment banks supporting its jumbo bond deal, which suggests the mood around dealing with Saudi Arabia is changing as the impact of the Khashoggi crisis ebbs. The banks not only want to participate on the bond sale, but also ensure they’re well placed in case the kingdom goes ahead with an initial public offering for Aramco.
Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s chief executive officer, spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one person familiar with the matter, a rare appearance that underlines the bond sale’s significance for Wall Street. Last year, Dimon and others skipped a global business conference in Riyadh, which had been dubbed the ‘Davos in the Desert.’
This isn’t the first time Saudi Arabia has turned to debt markets since the death of Khashoggi. In January, the nation sold $7.5 billion in international bonds, showing that the outcry hasn’t stifled foreign investment in the country.
JPMorgan is managing the bond sale along with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), and NCB Capital Co.
The bond sale, being pitched to investors over the last week in a global roadshow from Tokyo to New York and London, has forced Aramco to reveal financial secrets held closely since the company’s nationalization in the late 1970s, casting a light on the relationship between the kingdom and its most important asset. Both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service assigned Aramco the fifth-highest investment-grade rating, the same as Saudi sovereign debt, but lower than oil majors Exxon, Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
The state-owned company generated the most profit of any corporation in the world in 2018 with income of $111.1 billion -- more than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). combined. But accounts published before the firm’s debut in the international bond market also show Aramco -- an organization that produces about 10 percent of the world’s crude -- doesn’t generate as much cash per barrel as other leading oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell Plc because of a heavy tax burden.
Aramco is raising money as bond investors search for higher yields. Emerging-market bond sales have made a record-breaking start to the year, with issuance among all currencies already climbing above $600 billion, according to Bloomberg league table data.
The company plans to use some of the proceeds of the bond sale to pay for the $69 billion acquisition of a majority stake in local petrochemical company Sabic from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. The deal between three government-owned entities -- where the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund sells its 70 percent stake in Sabic to Aramco -- moves money from one pocket of the state to another.

Retail clients at brokerage TD Ameritrade increased their overall exposure to equity markets for a second consecutive month in March, yet they sold shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc.,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). All four members of the so-called FAANG cohort -- which also includes Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. -- have gained at least 35 percent since stocks bottomed on Christmas Eve, one-and-a-half times the S&P 500’s return.
“Taking profits isn’t the worst idea in the world,” said Joe “JJ” Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, noting clients had been buyers of Amazon for eight straight months while also showing immense interest in Netflix in recent periods. “What it makes me wonder is, they were the momentum stocks, so where do we get our new momentum?”
It’s possible the answer to that question is cannabis companies, according to Kinahan. While clients of Omaha, Nebraska-based RD Ameritrade shunned the FAANG names last month, many were buyers of Aurora Cannabis Inc. and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS)., which recently announced that it will begin selling CBD-infused products at more than 800 of its stores. Millennial clients also scooped up shares of Canopy Growth Corp., according to a statement from TD Ameritrade.
Retail investors were also large buyers of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., NIO Inc., and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T). in March. In addition to the FAANG stocks,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). was also sold heavily."
1291,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 02:39PM ET</span>",SEC steps on Tesla 'reasonable' to prevent problems: commissioner,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities watchdog's request that a federal judge hold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk in contempt over the billionaire entrepreneur's use of Twitter was ""reasonable,"" said a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official on Monday.
SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, a Democrat, told reporters at a conference in Washington that the SEC was reasonable in suggesting greater oversight of Musk's communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides. 
""The idea (is) that we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from recurring,"" Jackson said.
The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla's vehicle production outlook without seeking approval from its lawyers.
In a Friday order, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge would allow discussions on possible sanctions. ""I understand those who are skeptical and who feel that it's innovative relief – to me it was important relief and I thought enforcement took very reasonable steps, both to the nature of the relief and our oversight of that relief,"" added Jackson of the judge's order. 
The SEC, which had sued Tesla, asked the company in September to consider removing Musk. The CEO agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman in an agreement that also required preapproval of Musk's written communications that could be material to the company, such as volumes of cars produced or other information likely to change the value of its securities. In a statement by Tesla on Thursday, Musk said ""the tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.""
The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year. 

At the time the SEC also said Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla's lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose less drastic measures.

The state-owned oil giant is marketing a U.S. dollar-denominated debt issue split into six tranches with maturities ranging from three to 30 years.
One of the sources said demand had gone up to $60 billion. That would be the highest order book value since a record issuance by Qatar last year, which attracted around $52 billion in orders. 

Before opening the books earlier on Monday, the Aramco issue - which will be priced on Tuesday - had already attracted over $30 billion in demand, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said.

The recommendations come ahead of the April 26 annual meeting, where the bank's pay policy faces a non-binding shareholder vote.
Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, at the helm of the second-biggest Swiss bank since 2015, got 12.65 million Swiss francs ($12.66 million) in total compensation in 2018, with short-term incentive awards (STI) of 4.94 million francs. That is up from 9.7 million francs total 2017 compensation and 3.98 million francs in STI.
Proxy adviser Glass Lewis cited an ""unjustified CEO bonus increase"" for Thiam in opposing the compensation report, which 
Swiss ethical investment adviser Ethos also urged shareholders to reject. 
""We are once again troubled by the board's immediate exercise of upward discretion in increasing the CEO's short-term incentive opportunity for the past fiscal year, which appears as an unnecessary anticipation of a reward for potential future results,"" Glass Lewis wrote in a report seen by Reuters on Monday.
Glass Lewis has in recent years criticized Credit Suisse's pay practices as inappropriate, but last year had backed the Credit Suisse pay scheme. 
Institutional investor adviser ISS said a vote for the remuneration report was ""warranted though not without concern"", noting Thiam's STI opportunity rose following increases for other executives last year, ""while there appears to be some concern regarding pay-for-performance alignment"".
It pointed out that Credit Suisse CEO's total pay is a third higher than the median of its peers. 
Still, it added, Credit Suisse had offered justification for higher pay opportunity, fixed compensation levels had remained stable, repurchased shares are used to settle equity awards, compensation was in line with market practice in most regards, and several positive changes had been implemented over past years. 
Credit Suisse returned to an annual profit in 2018, its first since 2014, and had said rising pay reflected a job well done after restructuring, cost costs and a strategic shift toward more-stable wealth management from riskier investment banking.
""We take note of the recommendations put forward,"" the bank said in response to Glass Lewis's report. ""Credit Suisse respects shareholder democracy.""

1295,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 01:37PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Apple's Broad User Base May Provide Edge to Health Care Domination,"Investing.com - Apple is sidestepping the selloff in the broader market after Morgan Stanley said the tech giant's broad user base could give it an edge over its rivals in the race to emerge as a leader in consumer health.
Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) foray into consumer health care could help the tech giant's plans to diversify its revenue base, easing its dependence on iPhone revenue growth, as the U.S. health care opportunity is estimated to be three times larger than the global smartphone market, Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday.
The bank's upbeat assessment of Apple's chances to emerge as a leader in consumer health is driven by the company's track record of disrupting industries.
""Health care is a market where Apple has the potential to lead digital disruption – much like what iTunes did for music or the App Store for mobile services,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. ""Based on what it has done over the last five years, we see Apple creating the building blocks of another ecosystem” that puts the consumer at the center.
Apple's move into health care comes at time when wearables and electronic medical records are enabling data to flow more freely between silos and stakeholders, the bank added. Apple's watch and iPhone positions the company as an ""agent of change"" in health care and a leader among tech companies entering the space.
While rivals such as Google and Amazon are ahead of Apple, boasting greater artificial intelligence capabilities, Apple's vast user base gives it a clear advantage that cannot be underestimates, Morgan Stanley said.

Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA, as it is formally known, continues to pursue an asset sale in Germany to improve its balance sheet, and is also looking at additional opportunities to get up front payments for future iron ore supplies, Steinbruch said. In February  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc agreed to pay CSN $500 million in advance for a five-year iron ore supply contract.
“CSN shares were hurt by the company’s leverage, as investors didn’t believe I would sell the assets. But we’ll continue with the divestments,” Steinbruch said.
Global iron ore prices have surged to multiyear highs after Vale SA’s fatal dam collapse in Brazil hurt production and shipments, and Australian miners have also flagged lower output after a cyclone. Steinbruch sees average iron ore prices of $80 to $90 a ton this year. The supportive price scenario has contributed to CSN’s 93 percent rally this year, about double the second-best performer on Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa index.
Steinbruch said CSN’s net debt to Ebitda ratio will fall to 2.5 times this year as a result of asset sales. CSN’s subsidiary in Germany, Stahlwerk Thüringen GmbH, has the capacity to produce about 1.1 million tons a year of long steel.
""I want to leave CSN resolved this year,” Steinbruch said. “When the market accepts this willingness, we can double again.”"

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>","Qatar sues Luxembourg, UAE, Saudi banks in FX manipulation case","By Eric Knecht and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DOHA/LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar filed lawsuits on Monday against three banks, accusing them of causing billions of dollars of damage to its economy by what it called overseas currency manipulation in the wake of an Arab boycott against Qatar in 2017.
The cases, filed in London and New York, name Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland, the United Arab Emirates' First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Saudi Arabia's Samba Bank, according to filings seen by Reuters and a statement from Qatar's government communications office.
First Abu Dhabi Bank declined to comment, while Banque Havilland and Samba Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In the case, Qatar alleges Banque Havilland devised a plan to weaken the country's riyal currency on key composite indices by submitting thousands of ""fictitious and depreciated"" quotes, according to the court filings.
""But the quotes were phoney, as FAB, Samba Bank, and others repeatedly refused to transact with counterparties at the prices they were quoting in public,"" the filings stated. 
The lawsuits are the latest fallout in a protracted Gulf row that began in 2017 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic boycott on Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran.
Qatar, a small Gulf state but major gas exporter, denies the charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty.
The currency manipulation was intended to ""deplete Qatar's financial reserves so that it would be unable to complete its preparations to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup games, and would be forced to share the games with Saudi Arabia or the UAE,"" the filings stated. 
UAE sports chief Mohammed Khalfan al-Romaithi has said his country and other Gulf states could co-host an expanded World Cup 2022, a measure global soccer body FIFA is expected to vote on in June but which Qatar holds the final decision over. 
Qatar liquidated nearly $3 billion in U.S. treasury investments and drew down over $40 billion in foreign reserves after the alleged manipulation in a bid to support its currency, the filings stated.
With more than $300 billion in central bank reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets, bankers say Qatar has sufficient financial firepower to block attacks on its currency.
Its central bank began a probe into the alleged manipulation in late 2017 after it said unidentified banks were looking to attack the riyal by trading it between themselves offshore at artificially weak levels - to create an illusion Qatar's economy was crumbling.
""Qatar seeks to hold FAB, Samba Bank, and the unknown John Doe Defendants who conspired with them liable for the billions of dollars in damages that they have caused to Qatar, plus punitive damages and statutory interest,"" the filings stated.

They added elsewhere that Qatar also sought to hold Banque Havilland similarly responsible.

Morgan's Stephen Tusa, a top-rated analyst, downgraded the stock and further cut his price target to a Street-low of $5.
Tusa, a long-time bear on the stock, cited significant liabilities and little free cash flow to support the company's ongoing reset and cut his rating to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"", an about-turn from an upgrade in December.
""Investors are underestimating severity of challenges and underlying risks at GE and overestimating value of small positives,"" Tusa wrote in a note.
Tusa said investors are ""significantly over projecting"" the bounce in free cash flow and sees weakness in the company's power and renewables unit.
Listing the challenges faced by the industrial conglomerate, Tusa said GE Capital Services unit is likely to consume cash for the foreseeable future, with aviation fundamentals weaker than what meets the eye.
GE could lose as much as $2 billion in cash from its industrial businesses in 2019, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said in March, setting conservative profit targets for the year. 
He called 2019 a ""reset year"" and said though there was short-term pain for the company, free cash flow at GE Power would turn positive in 2021.
Culp has an uphill task of placating investors who have dumped the stock as the company racked up staggering losses of more than $30 billion over the last two years and cut its dividend to near zero. 
Analysts at research firm Gordon Haskett expect the company to report a negative cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion for the first quarter.
""This time around, we find it extraordinary that some analysts are suggesting that a potential GE free cash flow loss of up to $4 billion this Q (vs a loss of $1.7 bln in 1Q18) would be 'fair' or 'expected',"" analyst John Inch at Gordon Haskett said.
""We believe that magnitude of cash loss could be both highly problematic and poorly received by the bond market and debt ratings agencies.""

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 11:24AM ET</span>",U.S. Fed proposes new regulatory regime for foreign banks,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday proposed a new regulatory regime for 23 foreign banks operating in the U.S. that could make life easier for some lenders, while tightening up rules for more risky foreign firms. 
The proposal, which would affect major banks like UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC, is part of a broader plan by the Fed to more closely tailor banking rules in line with firms' risk profiles.
The proposed changes, which are subject to industry feedback, would relax the capital and stress testing requirements for the subsidiaries of foreign banks. They would, however, impose stricter liquidity rules on subsidiaries of foreign lenders that rely extensively on riskier activities like short-term funding.
The Fed also said it was soliciting input on imposing stricter liquidity requirements on foreign bank branches for the first time, although it stopped short of proposing new rules. 
In addition, the central bank proposed relaxing the schedule for how frequently foreign banks and domestic banks must submit ""living wills"" detailing how they could be dissolved in the event of failure. 
Currently, large foreign banks have to submit the plans annually, but the proposal would allow them to submit plans every two years. Smaller banks would be able to submit less detailed plans on a three-year cycle. All domestic banks would also be allowed to submit scaled down plans every two years and comprehensive plans every four years.
Overall, Monday's proposal could reduce aggregate capital requirements for foreign banks by 0.5 percent, in addition to lowering compliance costs associated with stress testing, the Fed estimated.
However, changes to the liquidity rules on foreign bank subsidiaries would see aggregate liquid asset levels rise 0.5 percent to as much as 4 percent, the Fed said. 
Most foreign lenders currently hold enough liquid assets to satisfy the proposed changes, but depending on a bank's precise activity, some banks including UBS and Credit Suisse could see their overall costs rise, according to Fed officials.
The Fed board of governors voted the proposal through on Monday, although governor Lael Brainard dissented.
The proposed changes were prompted by legislation passed by Congress in May 2018 which gave the Fed discretion to ease rules for all but the nation's largest banks.
The package aims to broadly put foreign banks on an even footing with domestic firms after the Fed last October unveiled a similar proposal tailoring rules for super-regional and other large domestic banks. 
But the Fed on Monday also said foreign banks tend to engage in riskier activities than their domestic rivals, including cross-border lending and trading, and short-term wholesale funding, leading it to be tougher on firms more heavily engaged in those businesses.
Foreign banks have for years complained that they are at a regulatory disadvantage in the U.S. and are likely to push back on an additional idea floated on Monday to impose stricter liquidity rules on the branches of foreign banks. 
Unlike foreign banks' separately capitalized subsidiaries, branches are legally part of the overseas parent and therefore not subject to the same degree of U.S. oversight as domestic firms. That arrangement had sparked concerns that branches could become a haven for riskier assets.

Fed data shows that of foreign banks with combined assets of more than $50 billion, around 40 percent of all their U.S. assets were held in branches as of June.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA won the backing of Versum's board for a sweetened $6.5 billion takeover proposal, overturning an agreed merger with rival Entegris as it bets on a recovery in electronic materials markets.
""This proposal constitutes a 'Superior Proposal' as defined in Versum's previously announced merger agreement with Entegris, Inc.,"" Versum said in a statement on Monday.
On a per share basis, Germany's Merck offered $53, up from $48 previously, after reviewing business data and following meetings between Merck Chief Executive Stefan Oschmann and Versum Chairman Seifi Ghasemi, filings showed.
Entegris stepped back from the contest, saying it would not improve the terms of the all-share merger signed in January, which would have seen Versum investors receive $42.43 worth of Entegris stock for each Versum share. 
Versum will owe its jilted partner $140 million in termination fees if it hammers out a final deal to be bought by Merck, filings showed. Versum shares were up 1 percent at $51.70 at 1430 GMT, on track for a record closing high.
Versum, the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products (NYSE:APD), had previously rejected Merck's overture, saying it was committed to the merger agreed with Entegris, also a supplier of materials for semiconductor production. 
Merck, a diversified healthcare and chemicals group, last month launched a hostile all-cash takeover offer to Versum shareholders - with a price tag of $5.9 billion including debt - as the German pharma group looks to boost its presence in the semiconductor materials market.
Merck's swoop has been viewed by some analysts as seizing on beaten down stock prices in the volatile semiconductor industry after demand for mobile devices slowed and prices for memory chips sank.
Merck, whose shares were up 0.3 percent, is seeking to further boost its high-tech chemicals division to supply more to the electronics industry, following the $2.6 billion purchase of Britain's AZ Electronic Materials in 2014. 
At the heart of Merck's chemicals division is a business making liquid crystals for flat screens, which has previously achieved operating income margins of 40-50 percent but is now suffering shrinking sales under intense pressure from Chinese rivals.
Based on about $700 million in assumed Versum debt and about 109 million shares, the increased Merck offer would be worth close to $6.5 billion.

(Reuters) - Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has agreed to pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit alleging it misled U.S. investors over excess diesel emissions and failed to comply with federal safety regulations, court records show.
The company said in a statement on Monday it ""continues to vigorously deny the allegations of wrongdoing made in this lawsuit"" and said the settlement is ""completely covered by the company’s insurance.""
Investors sued in 2015, charging that the company misled them by asserting that Fiat Chrysler was in compliance with vehicle safety regulations and that the company under-reported its reserves for the cost of recalls.
In 2015, Fiat Chrysler settled allegations with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it failed to properly complete 23 recalls affecting more than 11 million vehicles. It paid a $105 million U.S. penalty, conducted additional recalls and agreed to buy back hundreds of thousands of vehicles. 
The securities suit also raised claims Fiat Chrysler misled investors over the Justice Department's allegations it used defeat devices to allow diesel-powered vehicles to emit excess emissions.
In January, Fiat Chrysler agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. 
The lawsuit covers investors who bought Fiat Chrysler stock on a U.S. exchange between Oct. 13, 2014 and May 23, 2017. Lawyers for the investors estimated in a court filing that the settlement is equal to 13.8 percent of maximum damages, calling it ""an objectively excellent result when compared to historical statistics in class action settlements.""
The settlement must be approved by a federal judge in New York.

Broker Vic DTVM and fund Geracao Futuro Lpar proposed Patricia Bentes as an independent member and proposed the election be held using a cumulative voting system. Bentes has been a board member of different Brazilian listed power companies and is currently on the board of Cemig as well as a business professor at a Rio de Janeiro university.
That would mean board members would be elected independently and not in a single vote approving all names proposed by the board. Cumulative voting can only be required by shareholders holding at least 5 percent of the company's capital. The matter will be put to a vote at an April 30 shareholders meeting.
The pressure from minority shareholders reflects skepticism toward Vale's board and management after a mining dam burst in the town of Brumadinho, killing some 300 people, in the second such disaster in the region in recent years.
The board elected this year will oversee the last year of an agreement overseeing controlling shareholder group Litel, which holds the stakes of pension funds, holding company Bradespar SA and Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd, set to expire in November 2020. 

Vale did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The production cut also weighed on shares of Boeing's suppliers across the globe. Spirit AeroSystems fell 5 percent, while Triumph Group dropped 6 percent. European suppliers such as  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT), Melrose and  Safran  (PA:SAF) were down between 0.4 percent and 2 percent.
Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after the global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, which killed all 157 people onboard. 
Production will be cut to 42 airplanes per month from 52 starting in mid-April, Boeing said on Friday, without giving an end date. 
""The 737 rate cut to 42/month should help resolve the MAX crisis but with a large 2019 cash hit,"" brokerage Cowen wrote in a note on Monday.

At the upper end of its target range, the company could have a market valuation of about $11.30 billion and could raise $1.3 billion in net proceeds, taking into account restricted stock units and options.
Reuters had reported in January Pinterest, which plans to list under the symbol ""PINS"" on the New York Stock Exchange, could raise around $1.5 billion and that the IPO was likely to come in the first six months of 2019.
The company, which owns the image search website known for the food and fashion photos that its users post, reported annual revenue of $755.9 million in 2018, up 60 percent from a year earlier. 
But it remains unprofitable even though its net loss narrowed to $62.97 million in 2018 from $130 million a year earlier.
The company will go public with a dual-class share structure to concentrate voting power with Class B shareholders, which included Co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Silbermann, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Profitability has been a key theme for companies that have gone public since the start of the year. Lyft's shares slipped below their IPO price on the second day after its debut as analysts did not see a clear path to profitability.
IPOs of Pinterest and other such loss-making unicorns have presented a predicament for investors sitting on the fence since they do not want to miss out on popular companies with fast growth, but at the same time have to weigh the risks of businesses with unproven economics.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street analysts cut 737 MAX delivery forecast,"(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is now unlikely to deliver more than 500 of its 737 MAX planes to customers this year, and even that will depend on a swift removal of an effective halt in deliveries after June, Wall Street analysts said on Monday. 
Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft have been frozen by a global grounding of the jet following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on March 10, which killed all 157 people onboard.
The company's delivery numbers for March are due to be published on Tuesday and are expected to show customers took less than half of a previous consensus estimate of 46 planes as the groundings prevented flights. An estimate for March last week from another brokerage, Baird, was as low as 19 planes.
Yet Wall Street has been slow to draw conclusions about what that means for how many 737 MAX aircraft Boeing will deliver to customers this year and how many it will have to keep on its own books - even after announcing on Friday it will cut production by 10 planes a month or roughly 20 percent.
Of five well-known brokerages that produce estimates for Boeing's full-year numbers, Cowen and Jefferies cut their 2019 delivery forecast following Boeing's decision to lower production.
Cowen now expects full-year deliveries of ""around 500"", down from its earlier forecast of 630 737 MAX jets. Jefferies expects Boeing to deliver 497 737 MAX planes, down from 580. 
Cowen analysts said in a note that, to deliver even 500 MAX jets this year, Boeing would have to ramp up deliveries to foreign airlines swiftly in the second half. 
""It looks like BA won't deliver its MCAS fix to the FAA until late April and the FAA will have to test the fix before approving it and lifting the grounding,"" Cowen and Co analysts said. 
""This could delay a resumption of MAX deliveries to U.S. carriers (10% of backlog or ~480 planes) until June ... foreign deliveries may not resume until Q3 or possibly Q4,"" they added. 
The brokerage said while the production rate cut should help resolve the ""MAX crisis"", limiting the risk of a massive inventory build-up, it would mean a large 2019 cash hit.
Cowen and Co also reduced its price target on the world's largest planemaker to $460 from $475 per share.

Analysts have also indicated that Boeing will bear a financial penalty for direct costs such as customers concessions and productivity loss from disruptions associated with the fleet grounding.
Of the 26 analysts covering Boeing, four now have a ""hold"" rating on the stock, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, while two rate it as ""strong sell"".
The grounding on 737's has so far wiped off nearly $25 billion from Boeing's market value, making it one of the worst performers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.

The negative correlation between volatility and liquidity has been getting stronger over time, according to the JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). global head of macro quantitative and derivatives research. As volatility rises, market depth declines exponentially, exacerbating price moves, he said.
“Why was the Q4 2018 sell-off and subsequent rally so violent?,” Kolanovic wrote in a note last week. “The answer lies in market liquidity.”
A shift from “slower” human market makers, who often rely on valuations, to faster programmatic liquidity that rely on volatility measures to determine risk-taking and position sizing, can strengthen momentum and reduce day-to-day price swings, according to Kolanovic. However, it increases the risk of market disruptions such as that seen in October, he noted.
READ: JPMorgan’s Kolanovic Says Bad Liquidity Is Behind Stock Chaos
Volatility has become an increasingly important factor in markets in recent years, with an explosion of products designed to help investors hedge risks or boost exposure to various asset classes. That can leave markets vulnerable to spikes such as that seen in February 2018, when the Cboe Volatility Index jumped to over the 50 level intraday and some products went into meltdown.
During times of high volatility, the VIX starts to dwarf other factors as a driver of market liquidity, according to Kolanovic. Recently up to around 80 percent of liquidity variations were explained by the volatility gauge, he said.
READ: Marko Kolanovic Has Concerns About Fragility in the Marketplace
The shift to passive investing from active management, specifically the decline of active value investors, reduces the ability of the market to prevent and recover from large drawdowns, according to the strategist. Active managers would often be stabilizing forces because they might buy into weakness, but fundamentally driven, single-name trading now accounts for only about 10 percent of trading volume, he said.
Investors added $222 million to exchange-traded funds that protect against stock volatility in the past week, pushing assets of funds focused on VIX derivatives to more than $3 billion.
“The depletion of market-reversion forces was driven by a decline of value investors as money moved to passive and systematic strategies,” he wrote. “Liquidity has become to a large extent driven by market volatility.”

OSLO (Reuters) - Seismic surveyors Petroleum Geo Services and TGS, key data suppliers to the oil industry, warned of lower-than-expected first-quarter sales on Monday as initial project funding from explorers fell short.
The rival Norwegian companies sell geological surveys to exploration and production (E&P) companies seeking to drill for hydrocarbons, as the data helps them determine the presence of oil and gas in offshore and onshore reservoirs. 
PGS said first-quarter revenue for its multiclient segment - seismic surveys that can be sold to several customers - is estimated at $142 million, down from $201 million in the first quarter in 2018, while analysts had expected sales of $190 million, according to Refinitiv data. 
TGS said preliminary net segment revenue for the three months was about $110 million, compared with $135 million in the year-earlier period and below analysts' forecast of $146 million. 
Seismic surveyors saw sales dwindle in the 2014-2016 downturn after oil prices fell sharply and exploration came to a halt. While demand has since risen with a higher price of crude, the industry still suffers from overcapacity.
PGS shares were down 2.8 percent at 1100 GMT, while TGS shares fell 1 percent. European oil and gas stocks on average rose by 0.5 percent.
PGS said while multiclient acquisitions were high in the quarter, prefunding from energy companies at a lower-than-average 50 percent impacted revenues. 
""This will reverse in the coming quarters and the prefunding level for the full year 2019 is expected to be in the upper half of the targeted range of 80-120 percent,"" said PGS Chief Executive Officer Rune Olav Pedersen in a statement. 
The company’s preliminary first-quarter segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was about $65 million, compared with $92.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. 
The earnings missed market expectations by about 45 percent, brokers DNB Markets wrote in a note to clients. 
TGS said its pre-funding represented only 12 percent of its overall first-quarter revenues. 
""While operational investments and pre-funding revenues came in behind plan due to postponed start-up of projects, this was offset by late sales coming in above internal expectations,"" said TGS Chief Executive Kristian Johansen in a statement. 
Late sales are revenues booked from the sale of older data from the company's library. 
TGS said it has committed about $240 million of investments for 2019 and is ""well on track"" to meet its guidance of about 20 percent growth.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Grab is looking to raise another $2 billion this year to ramp up expansion, its CEO Anthony Tan told Reuters, only weeks after announcing more than $4.5 billion of funding in what has become Southeast Asia's largest round of private financing.
The mega funding comes as Grab rolls out an aggressive strategy to expand its bouquet of services, from transport to food delivery and payments, racing Indonesia's Go-Jek to become an app-for-everything in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people.
Grab, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank, expects to invest a significant portion of the funds in Indonesia, it said in a statement later. Reuters reported the funding target earlier on Monday.
""We basically received a very strong vote of confidence. And Masa shared that SoftBank is very happy with Grab and that SoftBank will provide unlimited support to power our growth,"" Tan said, referring to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son.
""SoftBank continues to believe that Grab deserves its unwavering support,"" a SoftBank spokeswoman said. 
Funding, to be raised from strategic investors, including SoftBank, will be a mix of debt and equity, Tan said.
Grab's ongoing massive financing round started soon after it bought the Southeast Asian operations of U.S. peer Uber in March last year.
The Singapore-headquartered firm, like its regional rival Go-Jek, has been raising billions of dollars to bring ride-hailing, food delivery, e-commerce and banking to a populous region with a growing number of consumers that use smartphones to commute, shop and make payments.
Both companies started out in ride-hailing and have since amassed millions of users with cut-rate prices. 
Backers for Go-Jek include Temasek Holdings, Tencent and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
Grab counts Toyota, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), China's Didi Chuxing and Hyundai among its backers. 
People with direct knowledge of the matter said Grab has raised about $8 billion since its launch almost seven years ago.
Last month Grab's president Ming Maa, a former SoftBank executive, said the ride-hailing company was considering raising more funds in its ongoing financing round, in which the SoftBank Vision Fund has invested $1.5 billion.
Tan said: ""With the amount of funding we have raised, and the support from strategic investors like SoftBank, we are so well-funded to execute on our expansion and investment plans, so there is really no need to IPO."" 
Grab wants to make at least six investments or acquisitions this year and plans to add 1,000 tech staff globally, Tan said.
In Singapore, it will double staff to 3,000 when its $134 million headquarters is complete by the end of 2020.

SoftBank's support will help Grab to ""grow very aggressively this year across our verticals - transport, mobility, food and payments"", Tan told Reuters in an interview.

A former outpost for Soviet geologists, it’s now the site of Russia’s most ambitious liquefied natural gas project, operated by a company that only entered the market just over a year ago.
Several times a week, a giant tanker leaves this remote place carrying the super-chilled fuel to buyers in Europe and Asia. It’s not the only LNG plant beyond the Arctic Circle, but it’s by far the largest.
Novatek PJSC, the main shareholder of the Yamal LNG plant, says plans for further projects will transform Russia into one of the biggest exporters of the fuel within a decade. Already the world’s top exporter of pipeline gas and second-biggest shipper of crude oil, exports from Sabetta are giving President Vladimir Putin’s Russia another conduit into the world economy for the country’s unrivaled energy resources.
“Russia can be in the top four main LNG exporters,” Novatek’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Gyetvay said in an interview in London.
Showcasing The Potential
Novatek has demonstrated that it’s possible to produce and liquefy the fuel in such harsh conditions at competitive prices and ship it to markets thousands of miles away in Europe and Asia. That’s helped by receding Arctic ice which is allowing a specially built fleet of strengthened tankers to ship fuel along Russia’s northern coast.
This week, Putin will tout the potential for development of Russia’s hydrocarbons at the International Arctic Forum in St. Petersburg. Russia’s leader has been a long-standing supporter of developing oil and gas resources locked under the region’s permafrost. When opening the first production train of the Yamal LNG project in late 2017, Putin said the region gives Russia the opportunity to take up the fuel’s “niche it deserves.”
“We can boldly say that in this century and the next, Russia will expand thanks to the Arctic,” he said at that time.
Novatek, whose biggest shareholders include Russian billionaires Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko, as well as French energy giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), became Russia’s top LNG producer after starting up its plant in the Yamal peninsula almost two years ago. The facility reached its full capacity at the end of 2018, ahead of schedule, doubling Russia’s share of the global LNG market to 8 percent.
The gas producer has aggressive plans to command a 10th of the global market by 2030, Gyetvay said, and position Russia as one of the world’s largest exporters alongside the U.S., Qatar and Australia.
All three of Yamal LNG’s production units, with a combined actual capacity of 17.5 million tons a year, are now online. Novatek is attracting partners for a second plant, the so-called Arctic LNG 2 project, which is expected to come online in 2022.
The company is also considering commissioning a third facility and may increase its LNG production target for 2030 by about 20 percent, to as much as 70 million tons a year.
Novatek’s resource base at two Arctic peninsulas -- Yamal and Gydan -- allows the company to raise production volumes to as much as 140 million tons a year in future, according to its chief executive officer Mikhelson.
Russia, the world’s largest gas exporter, has been slow to join the global LNG boom as it has focused investment on pipeline supplies to Europe. Until recently, the country had just one liquefaction project in operation, the Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) PJSC-led Sakhalin 2 project near Japan with an annual capacity of about 10 million tons.
The country has now taken an interest in the market for tanker-borne fuel amid growing global LNG demand and more difficult relations with its customers in the European Union.
Vast Reserves
Russia’s Energy Ministry pegs total gas in place within the region at about 210 trillion cubic meters, or over 70 percent of the nation’s total. Novatek’s Arctic gas reserves are “conservatively” estimated at about 3.3 trillion cubic meters, Gyetvay said.
“We believe that Russia could be the fourth or even the third” biggest holder of LNG production capacity, said Karen Kostanian, Moscow-based oil and gas analyst for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The resources are located more than 5,000 kilometers (about 3,100 miles) away from key markets in Asia and are almost 4,000 kilometers from the European trading hub at the port of Rotterdam. That requires extensive shipping capability.
The freezing environment also means Novatek has to produce natural gas at temperatures as low as minus 56 degrees Celsius (about minus 69 Fahrenheit), according to regional government data. This requires special techniques for construction in permafrost areas, including installing pylons in ice, and for ships to navigate frozen routes.
Furthermore, not only does Novatek manage in the harsh environment but it sees the Arctic’s location as a competitive advantage, Gyetvay said, because the lower temperatures actually make production costs cheaper because less energy is needed to chill the gas.
The cost of producing Yamal feedstock gas is only around $0.1 per million British thermal unit, whereas U.S. producers typically buy their gas on a market such as the Henry Hub, where prices are currently about $2.60.
Eyes On The Prize
After starting up its $27 billion Yamal LNG project, Novatek is finalizing the partnership structure for the planned Arctic LNG 2 project.
Novatek’s potential has attracted investment from global players from Total to China National Petroleum Corp., a rare bright spot for Russia’s energy segment hit by U.S. and European sanctions. While Novatek is on the American sanctions list, and the U.S. Congress is considering restricting investment in Russia’s LNG facilities outside the country, it won’t impact the start-up of Arctic LNG 2 or the company’s longer-term expansion plans.
Total, a shareholder in Novatek’s first LNG project, last month signed a deal to buy a 10 percent stake in the second plant. The French major’s commitment could prompt a rush of other potential partners to take stakes in the project, Gyetvay said.
Whether other companies buy stakes in Arctic LNG 2 or not, Novatek will move forward with it regardless. The company is already doing pre-marketing for the future cargoes, discussing potential off-takers and volumes, Gyetvay said.
Last week, Novatek signed 15-year agreements with Vitol SA and Repsol (MC:REP) SA to supply each with 1 million tons of LNG a year from the Arctic LNG 2 and other projects.
“We’re basically at that point in time when the train has started to move and it’s time to jump on or miss it,” Gyetvay said.

At 06:45 AM ET (10.45 GMT) the S&P 500 futures contract was down 3.4 points or 0.1%, the Dow futures contract was down 71 points, or 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 contract was down 6.4 points, or 0.1%.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has set its IPO bookbuilding range at $15-$17. The midpoint is over 20% below the $21.54 level at which it last raised funds. The range is a sign of caution among investors who witnessed a rocky first week for fellow tech-unicorn  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT). Lyft, however, is set to open Monday at its highest level since debut day.
The biggest eye-catcher in premarket trade is Boeing (NYSE:BA), which has fallen 4.4% in response to news that it will cut production of its 737 MAX, amid negative news flow on software issues after two fatal crashes. It’s the first time the company has cut production of the 737 since the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) is set to open at a one-month low, down 6.6% after a downgrade from JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 1.5% on news that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) would pay it an undisclosed sum for carbon dioxide credits under an EU scheme that aims to cap average CO2 emissions at 95 grams a kilometer. The income will be a welcome boost for Tesla, which was coy about its cash position last week when it reported a sharp drop in first-quarter deliveries.
Elsewhere, crude oil prices hit a new five-month high as the forces of warlord Khalifa Haftar overran more of Libya, threatening to curtail exports from a key oil terminal. The news has underpinned oil and gas stocks in Europe. The benchmark U.S. crude oil futures contract was at $63.39 a barrel, up some 0.5% from late Friday's levels.

Switzerland's biggest bank gave no reason for the departure, which it said in a statement was by mutual consent.
It declined to comment on a report in German newspaper Handelsblatt, which said the 54-year-old Rodermann was leaving after a turf war with Christine Novakovic, the Zurich-based head of wealth management for UBS's Europe, Middle East and Africa region. 
Rodermann joined what was then UBS Deutschland AG as management board head in 2015 and has been in charge since, restructuring the Frankfurt-based business and expanding its wealth management arm.
In 2016 he helped found UBS Europe SE which, as the main center for Europe, oversees branches in 11 countries. He will remain head of UBS Europe SE and country head for Germany and Austria until a successor is named, the bank said.
Handelsblatt, citing unidentified ""insiders"", said Rodermann had chafed over the fact that UBS Europe had regulatory responsibility for the branches it oversaw, but Novakovic ran their operations. 

Rodermann's exit leaves Novakovic on the inside track to run UBS Europe in addition to her current post, the paper said.

GE told the European Commission that it was not developing any other turbine apart from its 6 megawatt turbine when it sought EU approval to buy LM Wind. The EU found that this was not true after a third party provided details.
GE subsequently withdrew its request and resubmitted it a month later with more data on future projects. The deal was cleared in March 2017. 
Four months later, the EU competition enforcer opened an investigation into GE's first notification and the misleading data provided. Monday's sanction follows that probe.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 06:17AM ET</span>",Jaguar Land Rover begins Brexit-linked UK plant shutdowns,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) shuts its UK plants on Monday for five days over Brexit, adding to other shutdowns to leave at least half the country's car production off-line in what could be a pivotal week for Britain's divorce from the EU. 
The move by Britain's biggest carmaker, to prepare for any disruption resulting from Brexit, was taken a few months ago at a time when the departure date - since extended to April 12 - was March 29. 
Automotive firms face a number of possible risks under a disorderly Brexit, including delays to the supply of ports and finished models, new customs bureaucracy, the need to recertify models and an up to 10 percent tariff on finished vehicles.
Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to obtain a longer extension have also ruined contingency plans for some of them.
Shutdowns are generally organized far in advance so employee holidays can be scheduled and suppliers can adjust volumes, making them hard to move.
With Britain's political leaders still deadlocked over Brexit and some EU states questioning a further departure delay, culture minister Jeremy Wright said May would continue talks with the opposition Labor Party to try to find a compromise solution.
BMW's UK Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) plants are also shuttered this week, as is Peugeot's Vauxhall factory, which brought forward summer shutdowns to April. 
Together JLR, Mini, Rolls-Royce and Peugeot's Vauxhall brand, which is branded as Opel on the continent, built over 750,000 of Britain's 1.52 million cars last year. 
Honda has also scheduled six ""non-production days"" in April but has declined to say on which dates they will take place.
Britain's once buoyant car sector has since 2017 posted sharp falls in sales, output and investment. 
JLR has already had to cut output last year as it faces declining sales, partly as customers shun diesel vehicles. 
Overwhelmingly foreign-owned, the Britain-based car industry has become increasingly frustrated as a stable and attractive investment environment becomes mired in a deep political crises, risking free and frictionless trade. 
At least 25 percent of Britain's automotive engine capacity is also closed as BMW's central English Hams Hall factory continues a four-week shutdown while JLR's Wolverhampton site stops production for the week as part of Brexit preparations. 

Honda engine production will also stop on six days this month.

Judge Robert Jay told the jury at Southwark Crown Court on Monday he was required to discharge them. 
Former chief executive John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation when Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from investors in 2008, allowing the British bank to avoid a state bailout.

World stocks paused on Monday after a strong recent run, as potential flashpoints including a crucial Brexit summit and central bank meetings loomed, and investors began to look ahead to an earnings season that may be disappointing.
Signs of further stimulus from China helped Asian shares touch seven-month highs, but investors' enthusiasm was fleeting.
MSCI's world equity index was flat and European stocks slipped 0.2 percent as weak data from Germany and investor caution ahead of a string of political and monetary policy events held the market back.
In a document published on the central government's website late on Sunday, Beijing said it would step up a policy of targeted cuts to banks' required reserve ratios to encourage financing for small and medium-sized businesses.
German exports and imports both fell more than expected in February, data showed on Monday, in the latest sign that Europe's largest economy will likely have meager growth in the first quarter amid increased headwinds from abroad.
Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eased 0.2 percent, indicating a weaker start on Wall Street. 
Globally, stock markets have had a stellar first quarter. The MSCI All-Country World index had its best quarter in more than eight years.
""Today’s very minor move down has to be seen in light of recent developments,"" said Britta Weidenbach, head of European equities at DWS. 
""We're back at the levels where the correction started last year. So now the question certainly is, what's next?""
The European Central Bank will update the market on Wednesday, the same day as a crucial European Union Summit on Brexit, while China and the EU will hold a summit on trade on Tuesday.
""European institutions will be under the spotlight in the coming days as they attempt to display proactivity in trade negotiations, on Brexit and in monetary policy,"" wrote economists at Swiss private bank Landolt & Cie in a note to clients. 
Bond markets were being squeezed by investors' search for yield after benchmark German Bunds fell into negative territory.
Greece's 10-year government bond yields were within a shade of their lowest level in over 13 years as a cocktail of positive headlines boosted sentiment towards the country and zero percent Bund yields push investors to riskier investments.
German bund yields traded at 1 basis point, just holding in positive territory.
REALITY CHECK
The upcoming earnings season, which kicks off at the end of this week with U.S. banks reporting, is likely to be a reality check for markets.
Analysts have already slashed their earnings expectations for this year, which are now stabilising around 4.2 percent growth for world stocks.
""Q1 will definitely not be a good quarter for corporates, and it might well be that the market turns back to fundamentals whereas a lot of hope on China/U.S. trade deals and developments on the interest rate front had driven markets up year-to-date,"" said DWS' Weidenbach.
Currency markets were also distinctly risk-averse.
The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 97.269 against a basket of currencies. The euro inched up 0.1 percent, but hovered near a one-month low at $1.1229 ahead of the ECB meeting later this week.
Sterling inched up 0.2 percent to $1.3057 as a crucial week for Britain's negotiations to exit the European Union loomed. Prime Minister Theresa May must come up with a new plan to secure a delay from EU leaders at a summit on Wednesday as a deadline of this Friday draws ever closer.
Commodities markets were the exception, rallying strongly.
London copper prices rose as much as 1 percent on Monday, snapping two days of declines, on expectations of more stimulus measures in top metals consumer China and optimism over Sino-U.S. trade talks. [MET/L]
Oil prices rose to their highest levels since Nov. 2018, driven by OPEC's ongoing supply cuts, U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, and fighting in Libya.
U.S. crude was last up 39 cents at $63.45 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 42 cents to $70.76.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Engie-led consortium seals $8.6 billion purchase of Petrobras pipeline unit,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - A consortium led by French utility Engie has won a bid for Petrobras' TAG pipeline arm with an $8.6 billion offer, in a deal that boosts Engie's presence in the fast-growing Brazilian market and helps Petrobras cut debts.
Engie said on Monday its successful offer for a 90 percent stake in TAG was made alongside Canada's state-owned financial and investment firm Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, with more than $310 billion under management.
Petrobras will keep the remaining 10 percent.
Engie said buying TAG, which accounts for 47 percent of Brazil's entire gas infrastructure and achieved core earnings of $1.14 billion in 2018, would provide a steady stream of profits.
It will add to Engie's presence in Brazil, where its unit owns assets including hydroelectric plants, thermoelectric facilities and renewable energy sources.
""Our acquisition of TAG is a significant milestone for Engie in Brazil, a key market for the group where we have been present for 23 years,"" said Engie Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher.
Under Kocher, Engie has been focusing investments on energy services, renewable energy and infrastructure, while selling out of coal-related assets.
""It is a good diversification for Engie,"" said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, whose firm owns Engie shares. ""Also, Engie will benefit from growth expectations in Brazil."" 
Engie said the acquisition of TAG would result in its net debt increasing by around 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion). The consortium secured around $6 billion in financing to help fund the acquisition from 10 banks, three local and seven international. It did not name the lenders. 
Engie shares edged up 0.6 percent in early trading on hopes the positive elements of the TAG deal would override any concerns over the rise in Engie's debts.
""TAG will allow Engie to accelerate its development in the gas sector in Brazil, where Engie is already present in terms of the country's electricity sector,"" said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Gregoire Laverne, who said Engie was a stock his firm was considering buying.
The TAG divestment represents a victory for Petrobras' leadership and its Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing to unload assets in a bid to cut debt and refocus on exploration and production.

In September 2016, Petrobras sold a larger gas network pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for $5.2 billion to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, which beat out a bid by Engie.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>","With one final vote, Nissan shareholders dump Ghosn, seek clarity on company's future","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co shareholders ousted Carlos Ghosn as a director on Monday, severing his last tie with the Japanese automaker he rescued from near-bankruptcy two decades ago and from which he is now accused of siphoning funds.
Days after Ghosn's latest arrest in Tokyo, shareholders gathered for an extraordinary meeting, expressing bafflement and disquiet about growing allegations of financial misconduct laid out before them - while seeking more clarity on how Nissan plans to recover from the scandal.
Meeting shareholders for the first time since Ghosn's initial arrest in November, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and Jean-Dominique Senard, the chairman of its alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), said they needed to focus on collaboration and improving governance at the Japanese company. But they offered few concrete details about the way forward.
""I can't comprehend how this could have happened, despite having auditors,"" said Setsuko Shibata, a retired homemaker who said her family had held Nissan shares for decades. ""I can't say I feel better about the situation after today's explanation.""
Ghosn has denied all the allegations against him and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
Proceedings were at times interrupted by some hecklers on the floor of the meeting, which was attended by a near record-high 4,100 shareholders.
The shareholders voted to remove both Ghosn and co-accused Greg Kelly from Nissan's board of directors. Kelly has also denied the charges against him.
They also voted in Senard as a director, a move that was widely seen as an attempt to assuage concern about the future of the Nissan-Renault automaking alliance engineered by Ghosn.
ALLEGATIONS
Prosecutors last week took the highly unusual step of re-arresting Ghosn - who had been out on $9 million bail - returning him to the Tokyo detention center where he had previously spent more than 100 days.
Under the latest allegations, he is suspected of trying to enrich himself to the tune of $5 million at the automaker's expense.
Ghosn's lawyers called the arrest an attempt to muzzle him. He was due to speak at a news conference this week, but instead a video statement from him will be shown on Tuesday at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ), the FCCJ said on its website. 
Ghosn has been charged with under-reporting his Nissan salary for a decade, and of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books. However, the new allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show he used company funds for his own purposes. 
SHAREHOLDERS BAFFLED
Both Saikawa and Senard talked about the need to focus more on unity and respect among executives and workers, although neither offered details on the outlook for their complex capital structure, in which smaller Renault owns a bigger share of Nissan.
""I will constantly suggest the best possible evolutions in the framework of the alliance,"" Senard said after voters approved his appointment to Nissan's board. ""We want to secure the right future for Nissan,"" he said, without elaborating.
The fall of one of the world's most-feted executives appeared to have left some Nissan shareholders nonplussed.
""I was hoping to hear more details about the path forward. I wanted to know what sort of role a Japanese company can play in an international alliance like this,"" said a shareholder who declined to be identified for personal privacy issues.
""The situation seems to go deeper than it looks based on the information,"" said 68-year-old shareholder Roberto Montoya. ""I'm very suspicious of the situation, and most people are.""
Saikawa said Nissan may claim damages against Ghosn and that he did not want to pay severance to the former chair. He also said he would work to stabilize the company before standing down as chief executive.

""This is not an issue we can fix overnight,"" Saikawa told shareholders. ""We need to fulfill the task (of improving governance) and prepare the company for our next steps, and then pass the leadership baton.""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) has agreed to buy between 30 and 40 percent of Spanish energy company Cepsa from Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala, valuing the stake at as much as $4.8 billion.
The transaction marks the successful end of a quest by Mubadala for a new partner in Cepsa after it pulled the Spanish group's stock market flotation last year, citing uncertainty in international capital markets. 
Mubadala said on Monday the deal gave Cepsa a total enterprise value of $12 billion.
Reuters had reported in March that Carlyle, with $216 billion of assets under management as of December, was ahead of other contenders to buy a 30 percent stake in Spain's Cepsa for up to 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion).
Mubadala said the deal is expected to complete by the end of 2019, pending regulatory approval, and the final stakes of both parties will be confirmed at that time.
""We now look forward to working in partnership with Carlyle, which has a significant track record and energy sector capabilities, and with Cepsa’s management to further enhance and grow the business,"" said Musabbeh al Kaabi, Mubadala's chief executive, Petroleum & Petrochemicals. 
Mubadala, with assets of $225 billion including a stake in Carlyle, will remain the majority shareholder of Cepsa. 
Madrid-headquartered Cepsa is Europe's largest privately-owned oil and gas company. It reported a 15 percent fall in annual adjusted net profit to 754 million euros last year.
Rothschild was sole financial advisor to Mubadala while HSBC and J.P. Morgan advised Carlyle.

Equity for the Cepsa investment will come from Carlyle International Energy Partners I and II, Carlyle Partners VII, and Carlyle Europe Partners V and co-investors.

Debenhams, once Britain's biggest department store, has been fighting for its future after its sales plunged, prompting Ashley to buy almost 30 percent of the company before he sought to take full control of the group with either a takeover or an underwritten rights issue.
On Monday Sports Direct said it would underwrite a 150 million pound ($196 million) rights issue at Debenhams in exchange for the CEO role for Ashley and the agreement of lenders to write off 148 million pounds of debt.
The two companies have been at loggerheads for months, compounded by Ashley's move in January to force Chief Executive Sergio Bucher off the board, and the chairman out of the company, at its annual meeting.
If it cannot agree a rescue deal its lenders will take control of the company later on Monday. Despite that looming deadline Debenhams does not trust the billionaire Ashley to stump up the cash and the two sides have clashed over what should happen next. 
Sports Direct said over the weekend that Debenhams and its advisors had undertaken a ""sustained program of falsehoods and denials"" and called on its board members Terry Duddy and David Adams to take a lie detector test. 
The company said that Ashley had taken his own lie detector test, after the two companies clashed about events in a meeting, and said: ""Mike Ashley's score for example was so significantly high as to be considered rare in comparison to others"". 
Sports Direct said it was also considering its options after it made a 61 million pound offer for Debenhams at the end of March. The group has until April 22 to either make a firm offer or walk away. 

A spokesman for Debenhams declined to comment. Were the company to fall into the hands of its lenders its stores should continue operating as normal while its lenders try to find a solution for the group.

The BJP, which is seeking a retain power in elections starting April 11, released its manifesto in New Delhi on Monday, reiterating its pledge double farmer’s income by 2022, improve the GDP share from the manufacturing sector and double exports. It will also scrap Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which grants special concessions to the disputed state of Kashmir.
India’s 263 million farmers are a key voting bloc in the world’s largest democracy. The main opposition Congress Party has promised to write off farm loans through out the country. To match it, BJP committed to invest 25 trillion rupees ($359 billion) in rural development and said farmers will receive 6,000 rupees in income support.
""The essence of the manifesto is to deplete poverty to single digits in next five years and then eventually eliminate it,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. ""This manifesto has been prepared with a strong nationalist vision.""
It also promised to take its flagship programs -- providing toilets, electricity connections, houses, cooking gas, crop insurance and loans for small businesses -- to more beneficiaries by allocating additional resources.
BJP, which is leading in opinion polls, is offering giveaways to stave off a challenge from Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi. Congress has promised in its manifesto to rid India of poverty by 2030 by providing income support to the poor, waiving farm loans and creating jobs.
‘New India’
""With this document we are committed to moving toward a new India,"" said Rajnath Singh, Home Minister and head of BJP’s election manifesto committee. ""We will work on improving India’s ranking in ease of doing business,"" Singh said. ""We will try to double exports.""
The BJP is banking on the support of around 220 million Indians who have benefited directly from the government’s flagship programs, as well as a 750 billion rupees ($10.8 billion) income support program for small farmers and lower taxes for middle-class.
Modi has been criticized by the opposition for not fulfilling his promise of creating 10 million jobs each year -- a pledge that helped him win over India’s youth in the 2014 election. The ruling party denies this charge.
The boost to infrastructure will also ""lead to creation of a large number of jobs and livelihood opportunities,"" the manifesto reads, noting the government would target ""untapped employment-generation of potential of sectors such as defense and pharmaceuticals.""

Investing.com -- Call it the ghost of Dieselgate.
Shares in Germany’s big three carmakers are all starting the week under pressure from a preliminary ruling on Friday from the European Union Commission that they conspired to delay cleaner, more efficient diesel technology due to other commercial considerations.
BMW (DE:BMWG) was the worst hit after announcing it will take a charge of up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) against its first-quarter earnings to provision against a possible antitrust fine. It was down 0.5% as of 04:15 AM ET (08:00 GMT).  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz autos, was down 0.2% while paradoxically, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), whose name is tied most closely to the diesel scandal, actually eked out a gain of 0.5%.
Meanwhile, the mirror image of the diesel scandal is on view in Milan.  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is leading the FTSE MIB 30 after announcing at the weekend that it will join an emissions ‘pool’ set up by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to ensure that its vehicle fleet meets EU standards on average carbon dioxide emissions. Under the arrangement, Fiat Chrysler will pay Tesla for carbon credits generated by sales of its emission-free vehicles.
The EU’s scheme is designed to reward innovators in clean energy while giving some flexibility to conventional automakers. Fiat Chrysler, which depends increasingly on its sales of Jeep SUVs for its profits, has more trouble than most in meeting the EU’s emissions goals and the deal with Tesla represents a big loosening of what could have been a painful constraint on it.
Elsewhere, oil and gas companies are generally higher as crude oil prices push to new highs for 2019 on the back of an interview with Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih, who told Bloomberg that global inventories are still too high. Crude prices are also being supported by a rise in violence in Libya, which now threatens to engulf one of the country’s biggest oil export terminals. As such, Italian major ENI (NYSE:E) and the U.K.’s  BP  (LON:BP) – both of which have operations in Libya – are both down on the day.
The broader market is slipping after a soft start to the week in Asia. At 04:15 AM ET (0810 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.78 points, or 0.2% at 387.46. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.3% at the start of a defining week for Brexit, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.4%.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>","EU sugar rises as regional market tightens, world prices languish","By Maytaal Angel
LONDON (Reuters) - Spot sugar prices in the European Union are recovering from last year's record lows as world prices languish, prompting a pick-up in imports to one of the few global regions where output is slumping.
The EU sugar market is restructuring, with Europe's biggest sugar refiner Suedzucker planning to shut five plants next season in a bid to combat overproduction, which soared in 2017/18 after the EU scrapped output and export quotas.
Spot EU white sugar prices were at 422 euros ($474) a tonne in late March, according to price provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts, while global white sugar prices on ICE (NYSE:ICE) are currently at around $330 a tonne, not far off the 2018 decade low of $307.50.
(Graphic: EU versus global white sugar prices - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WKQfre) 
The rise in spot EU prices is not captured in official European Commission data, which shows average prices at end-January at 312 euros a tonne based on invoices paid by buyers who booked their purchases at the start of the season.
""Commission price data is lagged. At sugar conferences at the moment people talk of low European prices, but in the real world prices have firmed up quite a bit and should continue to do so,"" said John Stansfield, a sugar analyst at Group Sopex.
The rise in prices follows a poor EU harvest that has left output for the 2018/19 season at around 18 million tonnes, down some 3 million tonnes from 2017/18. The 2019/20 EU harvest is also seen at around 18 million tonnes following reduced beet plantings.
EU sugar stocks meanwhile slumped to 12.7 million tonnes at the end of January from 15.2 million a year earlier, European Commission data shows.
(Graphic: EU sugar stocks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CUZYDQ) 
""The EU market is gradually turning into a balanced situation, which is encouraging. Nobody is making money at these prices,"" said Julian Price, consultant at julianprice.com and former trader at ED&F Man. 
Suedzucker, which plans to reduce output by 700,000 tonnes per year starting next season, expects to make another operating loss in its sugar segment of 200-300 million euros in 2019/20. France's Tereos, the world's second-largest sugar maker, expects a full-year loss for 2018/19.
Agritel analyst Francois Thaury said the EU spot price rise was for now hurting regional sugar makers, many of which sold forward expecting a bumper crop and have been left scrambling for spot supplies to fill sales obligations.
They should eventually benefit, he said, but noted that EU sugar imports were also rising, meaning prices were capped and could come off the boil.
Sugar imports into the EU were at 163,000 tonnes in January, around double the year-earlier level, European Commission data shows. Although the imports are capped by a tariff regime, allocated tariff-free flows can still work to cool the market.
(Graphic: EU sugar imports - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WOOs4D) 
For the non-EU market, reduced output in a key consuming region such as Europe comes as welcome relief to exporters scrambling for new markets.
Analysts expect the global sugar market to record a deficit of 1.9 million tonnes in 2019/20, but following years of surplus, stockpiles are plentiful, keeping prices stubbornly range-bound near decade lows.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 02:15AM ET</span>",Sweet seats and candy canes: Inside Fiat Chrysler's Toledo turnaround,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
TOLEDO, Ohio (Reuters) - Lots of workplaces have a hot seat. At the Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio, there is a ""sweet seat.""
In the production line where Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicles are made at the rate of about one a minute, a panel must be screwed into the bottom of the vehicle. It used to be back-breaking work for two union members to carry the panel and screw it on as the vehicle moved down the line. 
Occasionally, they would miss screws.
Now two workers sit comfortably on adjacent chairs that follow the vehicle. Lasers point out where the screws go, reducing errors. 
What is remarkable about the so-called ""sweet seat"" at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Toledo plant is that like many other innovations here, it originated with United Auto Workers union members on the factory floor. 
Production workers here create proposals to simplify tasks that are ""too heavy or too hard,"" said millwright Greg Harman, who is on a team of 10 UAW workers that implements those ideas. A handful of automakers have adopted aspects of a similar system, pioneered by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. 
The uncommon level of union collaboration with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) management in Toledo offers a road map for union negotiations this summer with Detroit's Big 3: FCA, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. 
According to officials at the automakers, their key focus in this year's contract talks will be on productivity and profitability in the face of an anticipated downturn in vehicle sales and non-unionized competition from the likes of Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG.
That clashes with union demands to maintain healthcare benefits and boost job security, and comes on the heels of GM's warning that it could shutter a car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, along with three other UAW-represented plants. GM'S move drew harsh criticism from President Donald Trump, and prompted the UAW's new president to bulk up the strike fund - serving notice the union is not afraid of a fight over jobs.
At a time when national UAW membership fell 8 percent in 2018 after rising for nine consecutive years, and has failed to organize a single U.S. assembly plant owned by a European or Asian automaker, FCA's Toledo plant has more than tripled its workforce to 5,700 workers since 2009. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4S0wa
The biggest reason: Americans' love with the Wrangler and other high-margin SUVs.
The Wrangler became so hot that FCA started running the plant virtually round the clock. So UAW Local 12, which represents workers at the Toledo plant, pushed for a flexible system under which workers could choose to work between four and seven days per week - a first for any FCA plant. 
Temporary workers fill in the gaps, and Local 12 sought more protections for those workers, including providing a clear path to full-time employment status.
""Our members went way, way, way beyond the call of duty to provide what the company's needs were,"" said Mark Epley, the plant's union chairman. ""It's a competitive market out there and we know that any plant can be taken away at any time.""
Thanks largely to its success at FCA, UAW Local 12 has hit a 40-year high in membership through organizing workers at many other companies in the area, including a Dana Inc plant where workers make Wrangler axles.
SANTA ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE 
Success at Toledo took years to build. A decade ago, when the former Chrysler Corp was going through its government-funded bankruptcy, Toledo had a reputation as the automaker's worst-run plant. 
As Italian automaker Fiat S.p.A took control of the Chrysler, then-Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne turned to Fiat executive Mauro Pino with a challenge: which legacy U.S. Chrysler plant should they use as a proving ground for what Fiat called ""World Class Manufacturing,"" a version of Toyota's lean production strategy but adapted to the Italian automaker's culture?
Pino chose Toledo with the idea of turning the worst performing plant into the best. He had two years to prove he could turn the plant around, he told Reuters in an interview outside Cleveland, where he now runs an  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Corp aircraft parts plant.
Pino found a workforce of around 1,700 people, demoralized by Chrysler's bankruptcy. The plant produced just over 140,000 vehicles in 2009. 
He began working to win the workers' trust. He dressed as Santa Claus before Christmas 2010 and handed out candy canes to workers on the line, greeting each by name, workers at the plant recall. 
Pino also pushed for more productivity but did so by asking workers how they would redesign their own cumbersome jobs.
    ""Usually you need to convince people to change, but when they saw what we were doing they started coming to us,"" he said. 
""The new system gave everyone a voice,"" said Cheryl Reash, a 36-year worker at the plant. 
Tracy Seymour, also at the plant nearly 36 years, said the team of 10 millwrights - a team started by Pino - came up with a system for parts kits that eliminated the need for vast amounts of inventory on the line. That made it possible for workers to build 10 different engine types without having to bend over, lift heavy objects or walk off the line in search of parts.
""I wouldn't run without their equipment,"" Seymour said. ""It would be impossible.""
RUNNING HOT
Over time, workers and managers at Toledo worked to unplug bottlenecks up and down the assembly line. 
""Why we succeed and exceed is that union and management came together,"" Seymour said.
Soaring customer demand for sport utility vehicles also helped the Toledo plant. As workers cranked out around 500,000 Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee SUVs annually from 2014 to 2016, the plant's two production lines began running at well over 100 percent capacity, according to data from AutoForecast Solutions. This level of capacity utilization is rare in the industry.
Still, Fiat Chrysler could not keep up with demand in both the United States and in the 105 countries where the Toledo-made Wrangler is sold.
To ease the crunch, the company proposed moving the Cherokee to another factory so Toledo could make more Wranglers. In return, Local 12 was promised another new product. Baumhower said the local accepted the move based on that promise.
The plant is now ramping up production of the Gladiator pickup truck, which shares many parts with the Wrangler and is getting glowing reviews in the automotive media.
But while FCA's Toledo success shows what can happen when a Detroit automaker and its union work together, it also shows how a strong local can also punch back. In February 2018, for instance, Local 12 publicly protested an FCA plan to replace 88 UAW-represented truck drivers with contractors, forcing the company to back down.

""We're good at getting along if you want to get along,"" said Bruce Baumhower, who has been president of Local 12 for 26 years. ""And we can fight all day if you want to pick a fight.""

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 01:47AM ET</span>","Midwest floods hammer U.S. ethanol industry, push some gasoline prices toward five-year high","By Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The March floods that punished the U.S. Midwest have roiled the ethanol industry, hammering prices and trapping barrels in the country's interior while the U.S. coasts suffer from shortages of the biofuel.
The historic March floods have dealt a series of blows to large swaths of an ethanol industry that was already struggling with high inventories and sluggish domestic demand growth. And the ethanol shortages are one factor pushing gasoline prices in Los Angeles and Southern (NYSE:SO) California to the highest in the nation and they could top $4 a gallon for the first time since 2014, according to tracking firm GasBuddy.
Benchmark price for ethanol used in most supply contracts initially jumped on news of the floods but has been hobbled by rising waters around the Chicago hub that have halted barges and sales. That stands in contrast to prices on the coasts, which rose dramatically - drawing in heavy imports from Brazil, the main U.S. ethanol competitor. 
The floods inflicted billions of dollars in damage to crops and homes in the U.S. Midwest, and knocked out roughly 13 percent of ethanol capacity. 
U.S. ethanol is made from corn and required by the government to be blended into the nation's fuel supply to reduce emissions. 
While some ethanol plants were flooded, the primary effect of the rising waters was to shut rail lines that serve as the main arteries for corn and ethanol deliveries. 
Ethanol prices on the coasts spiked due to shortages, but Midwest producers have been unable to take advantage because of washed-out rail lines, market sources told Reuters. 
""Unfortunately for anyone who was impacted by logistics issues it was a double whammy. You couldn't capture the rally,"" said one trader. 
At Chicago's Argo terminal, the nation's main ethanol pricing hub, the cash price for ethanol fell for an eighth straight session last week to $1.29 a gallon, the longest downward skid since April of last year, according to Oil Price Information Service, which does daily assessments. 
Initially, fears of widespread plant outages boosted that benchmark, but plants proved more resilient than expected, continuing to produce despite logistical challenges. 
U.S. ethanol inventories were at 24 million barrels for the week ended March 29, just off a record hit a week earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
Chicago's price acts as the benchmark for millions of barrels bought and sold via longer-term supply contracts each day. While that price faltered, ethanol prices at the coast have surged, helping plants owned by Pacific Ethanol Inc and White Energy in California and Texas to take advantage of higher prices. 
Ethanol delivered into Los Angeles typically trades at 20 cents a gallon higher than Chicago, but that premium rose to as high as 50 cents a gallon, traders said. The price in New York Harbor was at roughly double normal levels, traders said.
The tight ethanol supplies, along with refinery outages, boosted retail gasoline prices and led to some gas station shutdowns in the West as blenders there lacked the ethanol needed to blend with gasoline to make fuel that meets government regulations. 
Gas prices in Arizona averaged $2.88 per gallon on Sunday, 17 percent higher than last month, according to the American Automobile Association. Prices were even steeper in California at $3.78 a gallon, well above the national average of $2.74 a gallon.
""Ultimately, Los Angeles could get close to seeing that average at $4 a gallon,"" Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at tracking firm GasBuddy, said, adding that much of that increase will come because of refinery outages in the state. 
At least one county in California has already surpassed $4 a gallon. The highest recorded average price for the state was $4.67 a gallon, in October 2012, according to AAA. 

The high coastal prices attracted barrels from the biggest U.S. competitor: Brazil. Overall ethanol imports to the United States totaled 558,279 barrels in March, the most seasonally since 2013, according to Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data. Most of the imports during the month came from Brazil, according to the tracking data.

1342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",Debt-Laden Jet Airways Lenders Plan to Sell Up to 75% Stake,"(Bloomberg) -- Jet Airways India Ltd.’s lenders invited initial bids to buy as much as 75 percent of the debt-laden carrier, starting a process that will determine the future of India’s oldest surviving private airline.
Potential buyers must submit their interest by April 10, State Bank of India Ltd., the lead creditor, said in a document Monday. A strategic bidder should have a net worth of at least 10 billion rupees ($144 million) in the preceding financial year, or at least three years of experience in the airline business.
The airline is credited with successfully breaking the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd. and was once India’s second-biggest carrier, but its fleet has dwindled to 26 planes from 124 as recently as January. Accumulated losses in nine of the past 11 years have caused Jet Airways to delay payments to banks, lessors and employees, while its founder Naresh Goyal was forced to cede control of the carrier.
Jet Airways, part-owned by Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC, needs 85 billion rupees to get back on its feet after a fare war by budget airlines wiped out profits and it racked up debt of more than $1 billion.
The fate of Jet Airways is crucial to the legacy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he faces an election that begins April 11 after holding power for the last five years. While he remains the favorite in the polls, his party has faced setbacks of late and he has been criticized for not living up to a key election promise to create 10 million new jobs a year. A collapse of Jet Airways, with 23,000 employees, could further dent his credentials.
Consortiums submitting bids should have no more than three members, with each holding a share of no less than 15 percent, according to Monday’s document.
After qualified bidders are selected, they will be provided access to the company’s data and the bid document.
Lenders led by State Bank of India said last week that “other options” may be considered if efforts for the stake sale “don’t produce the desired result,” without elaborating on what the options could entail.
The bank group had agreed to take a 50.1 percent stake at an effective cost of 1 rupee through the issuance of 114 million new shares in an attempt to bail out the carrier. It was a maneuver that was allowed under a framework outlined by the Reserve Bank of India last year for companies with a negative net worth as a temporary measure. However, a surprise ruling by India’s top court last week squashed that framework and raised questions once again about the airline’s future.
It’s unclear what happened to as much as 15 billion rupees of immediate funding that banks said last month they would provide the carrier. Earlier, the Indian government was said to be looking into options to save jobs at Jet Airways, including by asking other airlines such as low-cost operator SpiceJet Ltd. to consider taking over some aircraft, according to people familiar with the matter."
1343,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>",Jet Airways lenders lay out terms for airline bidding process,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Prospective bidders of struggling Jet Airways Ltd need to settle the airline's existing debt obligations as part of any deal to take over the airline, Jet's consortium of lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), said in a statement.
Jet's lenders last month agreed to bail out the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a temporary majority stake in the company - while they look for a new investor - and providing a fresh loan of $218 million.

In a notice on its website, SBI Capital Markets, a unit of SBI, said prospective bidders were required to submit expressions of interest for Jet by 6 pm India time on April 10.

Shares of the family-controlled airline rose as much as 8 percent and Hanjin Kal, the holding company for parent Hanjin Group, jumped 20 percent on news of the death, reflecting hopes South Korea's biggest carrier would be run differently under new management or a younger generation of the Cho family, analysts said.

Cho holds a 17.8 percent stake in Hanjin Kal that controls the airline conglomerate, and his son and two daughters each owns about 2 percent of the holding firm.
A South Korean activist fund recently boosted its stake in Hanjin Kal to 13.5 percent and vowed to take a role in management, blaming poor governance from Cho and his family.
Korean Air has been plagued by a series of scandals involving founding family members in recent years, culminating in the indictment of Cho in 2018 on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. Cho denied the charges against him.
The troubles began after Cho's eldest daughter, Heather Cho, made headlines in 2014 when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class and ordered the Korean Air plane to return to its gate at a New York airport.
The ""nut rage"" incident severely tarnished the carrier's image and generated derisive international headlines for months. Subsequent scandals involving Cho's daughters only deepened concerns around the family's leadership.
Shareholders forced Cho off the board in a landmark vote on March 27, making him the first founding family member of any South Korean corporate giant to be ousted in such a manner.
The vote added fresh momentum to growing shareholder activism in Asia's fourth-biggest economy, long dominated by corporate giants accused of ignoring minority investors.
LUNG DISEASE 
Cho, whose father acquired and privatized Korean Air 50 years ago and built it to become one of Asia's top airlines, was named chairman and chief executive in 1999. 
He died from a chronic ailment in a Los Angeles hospital early on Monday Korean time, the airline said without providing further details. 
A company official said Cho had surgery for lung disease a while ago and his condition had worsened over the past two years. 
Even so, his condition was not publicly known and his death came as a surprise to analysts. Only last year he had carried the torch for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

Cho's only son, board member and Korean Air President Cho Won-tae, is widely seen as his likely successor.

1346,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 07, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Set for Mega Debt Deal Pitched by JPMorgan's Dimon,"(Bloomberg) -- In a bond sale closely watched by investors globally, Saudi Aramco and its bankers are preparing to kick off what could be at least a $10 billion offering this week. Early indications suggest investors are already crowding in.
A message circulated among investors on Friday said interest in the most highly anticipated sale of the year already totaled more than $26 billion, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The state-owned oil giant and bankers spent the last week drumming up support for its debut offering at presentations in cities ranging from New York and Chicago to Singapore and Tokyo.
The success of the sale is hugely important for banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., that are working on the company’s behalf. They are eager to run an initial public offering by Aramco -- the world’s most profitable company -- if and when it comes, which would bring lucrative fees for the selected banks. In a rare appearance that underlines the bond sale’s significance, JPMorgan’s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon spoke at a lunch in New York Thursday to market the deal, according to one of the people.
Price Talk
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and NCB Capital Co. are also managing the bond sale, according to a prospectus seen by Bloomberg News. The initial price talk on the bond may be announced on Monday, with pricing as early as Tuesday, the people said. Representatives of the company declined to comment on the sale process.
“It will be definitely a jumbo deal with at least four tranches,” said Sergey Dergachev senior portfolio manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt. “Demand should be huge.” He speculated that demand could even surpass the record $53 billion in bids that Qatar received for its $12 billion bond sale last year.
Aramco is turning to the dollar bond market as the company is starting to raise cash ahead of the purchase of a $69 billion majority stake in domestic petrochemical giant Sabic. The bond sale represents an alternate way for Saudi Arabia to raise money and diversify from oil after an IPO of Aramco was postponed last year. Saudi Arabia has valued Aramco at a whopping $2 trillion, though not all investors are convinced it’s worth that much.
Torn Investors
The bond sale will extend the already record start for issuers from the Gulf Cooperation Council -- exceeding $30 billion so far this year. It caps four consecutive years of bond sales from the Kingdom, most recently pricing $7.5 billion in international bonds in January, only months since the brutal killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
While demand for the bonds is likely to be high, investors remain torn on whether that interest will allow Aramco to pay yields lower than what its owner does, the Saudi Arabia government. On the one hand, Aramco is immensely profitable and produces endless cash flow. In addition, investors who manage high-grade corporate debt are showing interest in buying the Aramco bonds. All of that could bring the borrowing cost lower than that of the government, according to Nikolay Menteshashvili, an analyst with Insight Investment in London.
But others see it differently. They say Aramco is inextricably linked to the Saudi government, which is subject to a variety of risks including low oil prices. That’s why Jim Barrineau, head of emerging-market debt at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc, said he wouldn’t be interested in buying Aramco’s bonds at a rate lower than the government’s.
“For an emerging market investor, it’s just the level relative to the sovereign that matters,"" Barrineau said.

It is unclear how many jobs will be lost or when the reductions will begin, the person said, requesting anonymity because the move isn’t public. The changes come less than six weeks after the mining giant announced a major shake-up of its senior management, with the promotion of three women to key positions on its executive leadership board and the appointment of a chief transformation officer.
Earlier Saturday, The Australian newspaper reported that the mining giant would target more than 700 white-collar jobs which would be cut as soon as next week.
The newspaper said cuts to BHP’s finance team were flagged at a company meeting last week by Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven. BHP’s technology team also faces a reduction of as much as 30 percent of its 2000-strong team spread across Australia and Singapore, the newspaper added.
A spokesperson for BHP declined to comment on The Australian report, but said the process of simplifying the business and support facilities has been underway for about a year. “This work began about 12 months ago and is across functions including finance, human resources, technology and external affairs,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Pain-care specialist agrees to testify against Purdue, other drug makers - court documents","By Lisa Girion and Maria Caspani
(Reuters) - A physician ally of Purdue Pharma LP whose views helped drive the explosive growth in the use of addictive pain relievers for common aches and pains in the United States has agreed to testify against the OxyContin maker and other drug companies, newly disclosed court records show.
Dr. Russell Portenoy, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was an early advocate for the use of opioids for chronic pain, a position he shared in medical journal articles, with regulators, at physician conferences and in other forums. He also was named as a defendant in some of the lawsuits filed by cities, counties and states seeking to hold opioid makers - including Endo and  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc - and their distributors liable for the cost of the U.S. opioid epidemic.
But Portenoy began talking to plaintiffs' lawyers as early as January 2018 and later struck a deal with the plaintiffs to serve as a cooperating witness, the records show. In exchange for his dismissal from the suits, Portenoy provided the plaintiffs with documentation of opioid makers' payments to him over the years, as well as a 36-page declaration that lays out what he would say on the witness stand.
Portenoy's previously confidential cooperation agreement and declaration were made public Friday as a part of a discovery ruling by David Cohen, a special master in the federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, where hundreds of the opioid lawsuits have been consolidated. In an email, Cohen said it was possible the records should have been filed under seal out of public view. 
Their disclosure offers a glimpse into the largely secretive evidence gathering phase of the litigation. Purdue executives have said the privately-held company is considering bankruptcy in the face of its potential liability. The company avoided having to stand as a defendant in a trial scheduled for May in Oklahoma by agreeing to pay the state $270 million.
Portenoy could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Purdue spokesman Bob Josephson declined to comment on Portenoy's declaration and new role in the litigation. 
Other companies, including Endo and Mallinckrodt, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Portenoy, who has held leadership positions at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Mount Sinai Beth Israel, was among the first physicians to espouse opioids as an option for the treatment of chronic pain, a condition that afflicts tens of millions of Americans, in medical journal articles published in the 1980s and 1990s. Later, he shared his views with physicians at conferences and in training videos sponsored by opioid makers, he said in the declaration.
Previously, physicians had been trained to reserve opioids for cancer and end-of-life pain. Opioids are chemically similar to heroin and the risk of addiction was viewed as too great for their widespread use.
In his declaration, Portenoy said he never altered his positions because of opioid makers' payments for research, speeches, consulting and other work. But, he said, the companies paid only for work that supported their interests and cited it selectively ""to promote opioids by referencing the positive statements that I made repeatedly without providing the background, analysis of the literature, and cautions that accompanied these positive statements.""
These ""unbalanced communications"" encouraged the prescribing of opioids to patients unsuited for them and by physicians who lacked the skills to manage addiction, abuse and overdose, Portenoy said. All of this, he concluded, ""contributed to the rising incidence of drug addiction and overdoses.""
Opioids are involved in about 50,000 deaths a year in the United States. In an effort to staunch the toll, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016 recommended against opioids as a first-line treatment for chronic pain.
In a tentative decision issued on Friday, special master Cohen ruled that Portenoy may serve as a witness for the plaintiffs - just not in the first trial scheduled to take place in federal court in Cleveland later this year. Cohen was responding to a complaint from the defendant companies that they had inadequate notice of Portenoy's new role.

Josephson said Purdue believed the special master's ruling was appropriate. He did not elaborate.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>",How flawed software and excess speed doomed an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX,"By Tim Hepher, Eric M. Johnson and Jamie Freed
PARIS/SEATTLE/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Minutes after take-off, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation.
A key sensor had been wrecked, possibly by hitting a foreign object, according to four aviation experts and two U.S. officials who were briefed on the flight data.
As soon as the pilots retracted the flaps and slats, according to flight data, the sensor began to feed faulty information into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), designed to prevent stalls.
Flying at full take-off power, according to the flight data, the crew then struggled with nose-down commands from MCAS, the four experts said. The high speed and the jet's forward-leaning posture made it nearly impossible to use the controls to pull the nose up.
Moments later, the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co jet hit the ground, killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight.
A complicated picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from the sparse commentary of a preliminary report and a new data plot showing how crew and technology interacted.
Ethiopia's transport minister said on Thursday that the pilots followed all correct procedures in trying to keep the plane in the air.
""The preliminary report confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that the crew followed the right procedures,"" Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday. ""Under the circumstances, with a number of simultaneous warnings in the cockpit, the crew have performed professionally.""
The airline's youngest-ever but highly-experienced captain, a 29-year-old with a lengthy 8,122 hours flying time, and his 25-year-old co-pilot, with 361 hours, left the engines at full take-off power. 
That would be an unusual step in a regular flight, according to four experts and five current and former pilots interviewed by Reuters, most of whom were not authorized to speak publicly.
""You would never, ever have full power for the whole flight,"" said Hart Langer, a veteran former senior vice president for flight operations at United Airlines.
The reason the pilots continued at full take-off power was not clear from the report. But it is not part of a usual procedure for dealing with the loss of key information such as the sensor data, the four experts said.
The Ethiopian Airlines statement suggested the crew left the throttles at takeoff power because they intended to continue to climb and were hampered by the nose-down commands of MCAS.
By the end, the aircraft was traveling at 500 knots (575 mph, 926 kph), far beyond Boeing's operating limits.
The Ethiopian Airlines statement said ""no excess speed was noted at the initial phases of the flight.""
The aircraft's speed and its nose-down angle when MCAS switched on for the last time may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive, the four experts said after studying the data. 
The Ethiopian Airlines crash, and another in Indonesia five months earlier, have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis as its top-selling jetliner is grounded worldwide, and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa's most successful companies.
All 737 MAX aircraft have been grounded and Boeing is working on an MCAS software fix and extra training that it says will prevent a repeat of such accidents.
Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday that both accidents were caused by a chain of events, ""with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function."" 
BIRD STRIKE 
Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take-off. 
A sudden spike in black box data was consistent with a bird or other debris hitting the plane as it was taking off, shearing away a vital airflow sensor, said the four experts and two U.S. officials.
Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday called that scenario ""completely speculative"".
Ethiopian investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said a preliminary report released by Ethiopian investigators did not contain any indications of this. 
Boeing said it would not comment on ongoing investigations.
As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the damaged 'angle of attack' sensor, which measures how the wing is cutting through the air, may have set off a volatile chain of events.
In both cases, the faulty sensor tricked the plane's computer into thinking the aircraft was about to stall, or lose lift. The anti-stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft's ""trim"" system, normally used to maintain level flight.
The first time the MCAS software kicked in, flight data shows the Ethiopian Airlines pilots reacted quickly by flicking switches under their thumbs - they had recognized the movements as the same type flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air crash. 
But data shows they were not able to fully counteract the computer's movements. At that point, they were a mere 3,000 feet above the airport, so low that a new warning - a computerized voice saying ""don't sink"" - sounded in the cabin.
When MCAS triggered again, the jetliner's trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level, flight data shows, while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a ""stick shaker."" 
    This time, the pilots countered MCAS more effectively, the experts said after studying the data. But when they turned off the system - as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of the Lion Air disaster - the nose was still pointed downward, leaving the jetliner vulnerable.
The combination of their speed and a nose-down attitude meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column, the four experts and one of the pilots said, and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible. 
'PULL UP, PULL UP'
The captain called out ""pull up"" three times, according to the cockpit voice recorder. The co-pilot reported problems to air traffic control.
In the meantime, the aircraft's speed remained abnormally high, the five pilots and four aviation experts said. 
The sensor problems and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too. In such cases, pilots are trained to turn off automatic engine settings and control thrust manually, according to a Boeing checklist, the pilots told Reuters. 
Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power.
Still, several experienced pilots said there was an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots' attention.
""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment,"" Muilenburg said Thursday. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk."" 
Among the distractions was a ""clacker"" warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast
As the nose gradually fell, the captain asked the co-pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the center console to help the plane recover from the dive, according to the voice recorder. 
But it was too hard to move the wheel. Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together. The captain, according to the report, said it was not enough. 
MCAS RE-ACTIVATES
Data shows the MCAS-related systems were switched back on. That would also reactivate the electric trim system, making it easier to force the reluctant nose higher, the experts said.
Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the FAA after Lion Air. The report did not address that. The airline did not comment.
The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes. But the data readout shows they flicked those switches only briefly.
With its power restored, a final MCAS command kicked in, eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at 500 knots, far beyond the plane's safe operating speed, defined by Boeing as 340 knots.
As the 737 MAX plunged, G-forces turned negative, pulling occupants out of their seats.

Just six minutes after take off, the plane crashed into a field.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Copper producers gather; electric cars seen driving demand growth,"By Zandi Shabalala and Ernest Scheyder
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global copper producers are converging in Chile this week as tightening supply buoys prices, even as the industry grapples with declining ore quality, project delays and worries the U.S-China trade war may hit long-term demand.
Despite these challenges, the industry is planning for substantial growth in the next decade thanks to an expected boom in production of electric vehicles, which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. Automakers are vowing to produce all-electric fleets.
With all that in mind, hundreds of investors, executives, analysts and regulators are gathering in Santiago, the Chilean capital, for the annual World Copper Conference.
""From a numbers perspective we have a deficit in copper, and it's expected to be a tighter market in 2019 relative to last year,"" said Eleni Joannides, a copper market analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.        
(For a graphic on 'LME cash copper price' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Vr2Qzw)
Relatively upbeat commodity prices since January have lifted producers such as Freeport-McMoRan Inc,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc, BHP and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc out of the doldrums and presented them with a new problem: the hunt for high-quality assets at a time of geo-political uncertainty.
LME cash copper is expected to average $6,397 a tonne this year, a Reuters poll of 30 analysts shows, slightly lower than $6,437 on Friday.
""I think we're heading into a bull market for copper,"" said Jefferies mining analyst Christopher LaFemina.
A lack of new supply and steady demand this year for the metal, widely used in power and construction, should keep the 25-million-tonne market in a slight deficit and support prices, analysts said.
The industry is moving to bring new supply online, but it will take time. Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, cut its 2019 output forecast at Indonesia's Grasberg mines by more than half as it transitions to underground operations, a costly process that will take years.
But Freeport, BHP, Nevada Copper Corp and other miners are spending more than $1.1 billion to develop fresh copper projects in the United States, a country once seen as a laggard in the global mining industry.
Panama, not historically associated with a large mining industry, is also seeing investment dollars. First Quantum Minerals Ltd plans to spend $327 million to expand a copper mine, with the goal of increasing production by 375,000 tonnes annually within five years.
(For a graphic on 'Exchange stocks for copper' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2VmZbmd)
Tightening supply this year was Freeport, due in part to the Grasberg mine plan, while miner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) halved its 2019 output from its Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in Democratic Republic of Congo to 100,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile, global visible inventory in the form of combined stocks held by the London Metal Exchange, Comex and the Shanghai Futures Exchange have nearly halved from a year ago to around 500,000 tonnes, data from the exchanges show. 
(For a graphic on 'Mining companies vs. Copper price' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Vs3xJ8)
    
Analysts said this has helped boost sentiment in copper and some other metals, which had been held down by the U.S-China trade dispute and hiccups in economic growth of top consumer China where stimulus has been promised.    
Copper is one of the metals that will benefit the most from an expected boom in the use of electrical vehicles, but significant demand for the low-emission automobiles is expected to only ramp up in the middle of 2020's.
Roskill expects sales of electric vehicles powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries to rise to 17 million units, or 20 percent of the total, in 2025, and 32 million, or 37 percent, by 2030 compared with 3 percent, or 2.1 million, last year.
Still, some copper executives are concerned that aluminum may try to supplant copper's role in electronic equipment in the near future. Aluminum is a cheaper alternative to conduct electricity, although less efficient.
A large portion of the weeklong conference is devoted to research presentations from industry scientists studying new applications for the red metal, part of a plan to go on the offense against aluminum.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Wife of ex-Nissan boss Ghosn appeals to French government for help,"TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - The wife of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has left Japan and flown to Paris to appeal to the French government to do more to help him.
Japanese prosecutors arrested Ghosn for a fourth time on Thursday on suspicion he had tried to enrich himself at the automaker's expense, in another dramatic twist that his lawyers said was an attempt to muzzle him.
""I think the French government should do more for him. I don't think he's had enough support and he's calling for assistance. As a French citizen, it should be a right,"" Carole Ghosn told the Financial Times in an interview before boarding a flight out of Japan late on Friday.
Carlos Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, has denied charges against him and also called on the French government for help.
France, which holds a 15 percent stake in Nissan's alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), said it was monitoring the situation.
""We fully exercise consular protection. The French ambassador is in regular contact,"" an official from French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Sunday.
""The wife of Carlos Ghosn has been received by the (Elysee) Secretary General during his (Ghosn) previous incarceration,"" the official added.
""A DIFFERENT PERSON""
Carole Ghosn said her husband's previous 108-day imprisonment had left him ""a different person"" and that normal life under bail conditions had been impossible.
Tokyo prosecutors, Ghosn's lawyer and his spokesperson were not immediately available for comment. 
Public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday that prosecutors suspected Ghosn siphoned off payments through a company where his wife is an executive to purchase a yacht and a boat.
The prosecutors asked her to meet them for voluntary questioning as an unsworn witness, but the request was turned down, which prompted them to ask judges to question her on their behalf, the broadcaster said.
Such a request gives judges the power to question on a mandatory basis witnesses who refuse to testify, according to NHK. 
Ghosn's lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said on Thursday prosecutors confiscated Ghosn's mobile phone, documents, notebooks and diaries, along with his wife's passport and mobile phone.
The FT said prosecutors had confiscated his wife's Lebanese passport in a dawn raid on their apartment in central Tokyo on Thursday morning, but did not discover her U.S. passport.
""I'm all alone here. It's traumatising what happened,” she was quoted as saying while awaiting her flight.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors will be able to hold Ghosn for up to 22 days without charging him. The fresh arrest opens up the possibility that he will be interrogated again without his lawyer present, as is the norm in Japan.
The additional charge would likely prolong Ghosn's trial, which is expected to begin later this year, his lawyer has said, adding that loss of access to Ghosn's trial-related documents could put his client at a disadvantage in fighting his case.
Ghosn faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses on to Nissan's books during the financial crisis.
Released on $9 million bail on March 6, the executive says he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
The scandal has rocked the global auto industry and shone a harsh light on Japan's judicial system.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Samba Financial Group, Saudi Arabia's third-largest bank by assets, expects Saudi banks to see double-digit asset growth by early 2020, supported by government plans to diversify its oil-based economy, its chief executive told Reuters. 
Riyadh plans to increase state spending to an all-time high of 1.11 trillion riyals ($295 billion) this year, from 1.03 trillion in 2018, in an effort to spur economic growth that has been hurt by relatively low oil prices.
Exemplifying the investment spree is the multi-billion dollar Qiddiya entertainment resort near Riyadh, whose construction was begun in April last year and which promises more than 300 recreational and educational facilities.
""The government announced a number of transformational projects in entertainment, tourism, housing, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). All these initiatives will add multi-billion dollars to Samba and the banking industry,"" Rania Nashar said in an interview.
""We believe that credit uptake will be moving up sharply and we could see double-digit asset growth, if not by the end of this year then by early 2020,"" she added.
Nashar, who in 2017 became the first female CEO of a listed Saudi commercial bank, expects loan growth to pick up in the third quarter. 
Lending activity to the private sector, a sign of banks' confidence in the economy, had weakened over the past few years as the oil price slump slowed down the kingdom's economic growth and cut demand for loans.
Yet lending grew 2.8 percent in 2018, mostly driven by demand for mortgages under government plans to increase home ownership. Total asset growth reached 2.5 percent during the same period.
Samba, which reported a 10 percent rise in 2018 net profit and which ranks behind National Commercial Bank (NCB) and al Rajhi among Saudi banks by total assets, will increase consumer lending to tap opportunities in mortgage and SME finance, Nashar said. 
She also said the bank is looking into opportunities to issue bonds, without giving details. 
Regarding consolidation in the Saudi banking sector, Nashar said Samba is not actively evaluating any proposals to merge with other banks. 
She did not expect any significant impact on Samba's growth from recent mergers, involving NCB and Riyad Bank, and Saudi British Bank and Al Awwal. 
""It is possible that Samba may initially lose its ranking among the top three banks,"" she added. ""But we can gain from the increased business from customers of these merged entities who choose to diversify to other banks.""

The step will let the Italian carmaker offset carbon dioxide emissions from its cars against Tesla's, by bringing down its average figure to a permissible level, the FT said. 
The report did not mention further financial details of the specific amount that Fiat Chrysler has agreed to pay Tesla.
The Italian carmaker formed an open pool with Tesla on Feb. 25, the report added, citing a declaration with the European Commission. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Fiat Chrysler did not directly address the amount that it would pay but added it would ""optimize the options for compliance that the regulations offer.""

NHK said prosecutors suspect that Ghosn siphoned off part of the payments through a company where his wife, Carole, is an executive to purchase a yacht and a boat.
The prosecutors asked her to meet them for voluntary questioning as an unsworn witness, but the request was turned down, which prompted them to ask judges to question her on their behalf before they open the first hearing on the allegations, the broadcaster said.
Such a request gives judges the power to question on a mandatory basis witnesses who refuse to testify, according to NHK.

The owner of the sportswear firm is also considering a 60 million pounds takeover bid for Debenhams this weekend, the Sunday Times said in a separate report.
A formal offer is being put together by him and would come with conditions, the Sunday Times said, citing an unnamed source.
Debenhams secured 200 million pounds in new funds last week but warned that shareholders still face being wiped out unless it secures financial support from Sports Direct, which holds a near 30 percent stake.
Debenhams said Sports Direct needed to either make a firm offer for the group, underwrite a rights issue of new stock, or provide debt funding if it wanted to prevent Debenhams falling into the hands of its lenders. 
In a letter to the Debenhams board dated April 5, Sports Direct said it would be willing to underwrite the group with 150 million pounds in cash if Ashley was named as CEO, the FT said.
Sports Direct was not immediately available for comment and Debenhams declined to comment.

Last year Sports Direct bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration and it has been trying to wrest control of Debenhams for months to further beef up its presence in the sector.

1363,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 06, 2019 11:06AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. ‘No Free Lunch’ Has Different Meaning For Some U.S. Gas Drillers
There’s no such thing as a free lunch. That’s the maxim the world pretty much operates by.
Yet, the experiences of natural gas drillers at Texas’ Waha hub may make that sound like a cruel joke.
Next-day natural gas prices at Waha plunged to record negative levels this week. And some drillers were not only getting no money for the commodity, but also paying those with spare pipeline capacity to take the unwanted gas.
That’s akin to giving away your bread and paying people to eat it. It’s not something OPEC is ever expected to do with its oil, even if that unlikely reaches zero value at some point.
Pipeline constraints in the Permian basin in West Texas were to blame for the phenomenon. The Permian is the nation’s largest oil field, but it also produces large volumes of gas and the region lacks pipelines to move it. That has squeezed gas prices there for some time.
Weak demand and recent equipment problems on a key pipeline in New Mexico have exacerbated the problem, Reuters reported.
Spot prices at the Waha hub fell to minus $3.38 per million British thermal units for Wednesday from minus 2 cents for Tuesday. That beat the prior all-time next-day low of minus $1.99 for March 29.
On the broader front, futures of gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which set month-ahead prices, have also been weak lately as the advent of spring weather tempers heating demand.
The United States experienced one of its heaviest gas consumption periods ever in the winter as heating demand spiked from record low temperatures caused by a polar vortex. Gas futures reached more than 4-1/2-year highs of nearly $5 at the height of the cold weather in November. They are now well below $3.
2. As Oil Prices Flirt With Highs, Energy Stocks Slide
When oil prices rack up gains, energy stocks tend to join in on the fun. But energy stocks lagged the swashbuckling moves higher in oil prices this week, leaving many scrambling for answers.
Oil prices rose nearly 5%, outpacing gains in the S&P 500 energy sector, which served up an increase of about 2.25%.
Some in the investment community outlined three factors for the disconnect between energy stocks and oil prices: valuation, valuation, valuation.
Energy stocks have gone up too fast too soon. This prompted investors to remain on the sidelines or head for the exits. The energy sector trades at 18x 2019 earnings, above 16.3x for the S&P 500.
There appears little hope, however, that energy companies will be able to jack up earnings and justify their valuations as the bulk of companies in the sector have seen double-digit declines in first-quarter earnings expectations.
Among the 11 sectors, the energy sector has recorded the largest decrease in expected earnings growth since the start of first quarter to -18.4%, FactSet said last week. Despite the decline in expected earnings, the energy sector ""has witnessed the third-largest increase in price of all eleven sectors since December 31 at 15.6%,"" the report said.
The lower expectations on earnings growth has been driven by lower average oil prices in the first quarter of the year compared with a the same period a year ago.
""Despite an increase in price during the quarter, the average price of oil in Q1 2019 ($54.81) to date is 13% lower than the average price of oil in Q1 2018 ($62.89),"" FactSet said.
3. Travel Spending Expectations Fall
The Dow Jones Transportation index is down slightly year to date, slightly below the Dow Industrials. But those long transports may have pause, given Morgan Stanley’s note this week.
The investment bank said in note on airline stocks that companies are lowering their budgets for corporate travel this year after surveying managers again “to obtain an update given U.S. Government shutdown effects, uncertainty regarding Brexit and slowing global macro trends.”
On a budget-weighted basis, corporate travel expenditure is expected to grow 2% in 2019, down from 3.7% growth expectations from a survey in November.
Of airline respondents surveyed, 59% expect an increase in budget spending, which is down from 66% in November.
“In this update we focus primarily on volume-based changes in travel spend, with airline managers now expecting net booking volume increase of (about) 1.5% in 2019,” Morgan Stanley said. “Compared to our November survey where 75% of respondents expected an increase in airline bookings for 2019, now only 45% of respondents expect an increase.”"
1364,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2019 10:54AM ET</span>",SAP cloud business head quits after 27 years in latest top departure,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Software company SAP said the head of its cloud business group had quit, the latest in a string of top departures as Europe's most valuable technology company reshapes its operations.
Robert Enslin, who joined SAP in 1992 and had served on its board since 2014, had been tipped by some as a potential successor to Chief Executive Bill McDermott but has departed to take an unspecified opportunity elsewhere.
During his two-year tenure as head of the cloud business group, Enslin helped build out SAP's cloud portfolio, including its $8 billion deal last year to buy Qualtrics, which specialises in tracking online sentiment.
SAP did not say if he was getting any sort of payoff.
Enslin's exit follows other high-profile departures, including Bjoern Goerke, chief technology officer and head of SAP's cloud platform business, and Bernd Leukert, the board executive who ran global service and support.
Programming gurus Rich Heilman and Thomas Jung - both highly respected among SAP developer specialists - said last month they had been let go by SAP, but have now found new roles and are staying, a company spokesman said.
The departures underscore McDermott's long-stated ambition to transform SAP into a digital platform business, but the exit of long-serving and well-regarded staff with extensive know-how risks alienating core customers.
SAP said in January around 4,400 people would leave under a restructuring. Arch-rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has also announced layoffs and some of its top talent has defected to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
SAP shares have risen steadily in recent weeks from a nine-month low of 83.95 euros set on Jan.3. They closed at 102.5 euros on Friday, down 1.1 pct on the day. 
SAP said board member Jennifer Morgan, who joined the company in 2004 and most recently co-led SAP's global customer operations, would succeed Enslin as president of the cloud business group with imminent effect.
Adaire Fox-Martin will take sole responsibility for global customer operations as president.
In a Tweet, Enslin said: ""Though my tenure with #SAP has come to an end, my personal belief and public advocacy for SAP’s innovation and vision to help the world run better never will. Thank you ... dear colleagues for 27 spectacular years.""

SAP will report its results for the first quarter as planned on April 24.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2019 05:28AM ET</span>",Boeing cuts 737 MAX output in wake of two deadly crashes,"By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson
CHICAGO/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Friday it plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes, signaling it does not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon.
Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard.
Production will be cut to 42 airplanes per month from 52 starting mid-April, the company said in a statement, without giving an end-date.
U.S. and airline officials said they now believe the plane could be grounded for at least two months, but an even longer grounding is a serious possibility.
The crash in Ethiopia and the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia last October that killed all 189 people on board have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis.
Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday said the company now knows that a chain of events caused both disasters, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two.
Boeing said it would not reduce jobs at the new production rate and will work to minimize the financial impact. 
The company's board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes, Muilenburg said. The group will ""recommend improvements to our policies and procedures"" for its 737 MAX and other airplane programs. 
Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents.
Shares in  Boeing Co  fell around two percent after the market closed on Friday. While the number of 737 MAX planes grounded is just over 370, nearly 5,000 more are on order. 
Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said.
Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. Boeing had been planning to speed up production in June to 57 a month.
Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory.
Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems Holdings said it will continue to make 52 737 MAX shipsets - the complete set of parts for each aircraft - per month, storing extras at its facilities. Its shares fell 3.5 percent.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month. He added that the Ethiopian Airlines 302 preliminary report ""was very thorough and well done.""
Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart was named by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to head an international team to review the safety of the 737 MAX.
He told reporters on Friday he thought the review, which will start on Monday, could take about three months. It is still not clear what countries will take part.
He said investigators are going to be focused far more on the interaction between software and pilots than mechanical issues in future.

""This is territory we are going to see more of,"" Hart said.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of a business forum held in Seoul on Thursday by the South Korean government and China's Guangdong province, it said. 
Hyundai and Tencent did not offer any immediate comments on the report.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2019 02:31AM ET</span>",Big banks to report first quarter results with lowered expectations,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will focus on falling profits, a more dovish Federal Reserve and lower interest rates as major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016.
On Friday, April 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co will post results to begin the earnings season in earnest.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Tuesday.
In the wake of the Federal Reserve's cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data.
(For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, https://tmsnrt.rs/2HOVt1D)
""The Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they're saying about the economy,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""Flat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It's not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.""
The central bank's change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.
Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond's yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.
""That's why the estimates are going down,"" Carlson added. ""(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there's an underlying concern about loan growth.""
In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.
Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings ""recession"" that ended in 2016. 
The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates. 
In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter. 
""Within financials, the industry that's been hit hardest is capital markets,"" said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. ""Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines"" in first-quarter earnings estimates.
But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.
Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note ""to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings."" But he called the impact from the Fed's decision ""a minor one,"" and wrote that aside from these impacts, ""bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.""
Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500's 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.

In today's late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period. 

""Psychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,"" Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. ""Banks are up there.""

The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A, or PDVSA , and also on two companies and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March. 
""Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil, providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat,"" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a statement.
""Cuba continues to profit from, and prop up, the illegitimate Maduro regime through oil-for-repression schemes as they attempt to keep Maduro in power."" 
The latest round of U.S. sanctions, announced earlier by Vice President Mike Pence in a speech in Houston, aim to further undermine Maduro's government after the United States and most Western nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president of Venezuela.

Guaido invoked the Venezuelan constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A consortium led by France's Engie SA submitted the highest offer for a major gas pipeline unit owned by Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-run oil firm said on Friday, as the company's biggest divestment draws to a close.
In a filing, Petrobras, as the company is known, said the Engie consortium, which includes Canada's Caisse de Dépôt e Placement du Québec, presented an $8.6 billion bid for 90 percent of the TAG gas pipeline unit in northern and northeastern Brazil.
That topped offers by two competing consortia, led by Itausa Investimentos Itau SA and EIG Global Energy Partners with Mubadala Investment Co, respectively.
Two sources with knowledge of the matter said the difference between the bids was very small. The second highest bid, delivered by EIG Global Energy Partners and Mubadala Investment Company, was less than 1 percent below Engie's bid, they said. 
Engie subsidiaries in different countries account for 75 percent of the winning consortium and the Canadian pension fund the other 25 percent, one of the sources added, asking for anonymity to discuss undisclosed details.
Around 60 percent of the bid was financed by Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Banco Bradesco SA and Banco do Brasil SA .
The EIG-Mubadala group was financed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The third group, led by Brazilian holding Itausa Investimentos Itau SA, was also financed also by local banks.  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA was Petrobras adviser on the deal.
The price tag includes the payment by the Engie group of $800 million in debts to Brazilian state development bank BNDES. At an exchange rate of 3.85 reais to $1, Petrobras said, the deal values all of TAG at 35.1 billion reais.
The divestment represents a victory for current Petrobras leadership and Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing to aggressively unload assets in a bid to cut debt and refocus on exploration and production.
The sale process began in October 2017 but was interrupted last year by a Supreme Court injunction. 
In September 2016, Petrobras sold a larger gas network pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for $5.2 billion to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, which beat out a bid by Engie.
Petrobras will continue to distribute natural gas through the TAG system under the terms of long-term contracts, the company said in the statement.

Bloomberg reported on the TAG sale earlier on Friday.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 05:32PM ET</span>",U.S. judge rules against Expedia in United Airlines fare listings lawsuit,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday rejected  Expedia  Inc's request for an injunction that would have required United Airlines to continue providing fare data for flights after Sept. 30, when the companies' contract ends.
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said Expedia had shown a ""likelihood of success"" on the merits of its breach of contract claim, but did not show a preliminary injunction was needed to avoid irreparable harm or serve the public interest.
An injunction would have required United, part of Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc, to provide Expedia with fare and schedule information for all its publicly available flights, including those after Sept. 30.
""We welcome the ruling from the judge in favor of United which will minimize the risk of disrupting our customers’ travel plans and ensure we can effectively serve customers who need to make changes to their itineraries purchased through Expedia,"" United said in an emailed statement.
Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The dispute came as some carriers try to reduce distribution costs by encouraging travelers to book directly rather than through online travel agencies such as Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co has long relied on direct bookings, and JetBlue Airways Corp in October 2017 pulled its fares from several online agencies.
Expedia accused United of trying to force a renegotiation of their 2011 contract by threatening to withhold fares for flights after Sept. 30, leaving it unable to book or change tickets.
United countered that limiting fare listings would benefit travelers flying later, because the companies' ""coming divorce"" would leave Expedia unable to serve them.
In his decision, Castel found no language in the contract between Expedia and United suggesting that United would withhold fare information in the final months, and no evidence that Expedia would be unable to service customers through Sept. 30.
But he also found no proof that maintaining the ""contractual status quo"" would irreparably harm Expedia, even if the dispute led to customer confusion and hurt its reputation.
Castel also said the public interest did not weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction.
""There is no serious issue as to the ability of members of the public to fly on their airline of their choosing,"" he wrote. ""Meaningful and prominent disclosure will mitigate any harm to the public.""

The case is Expedia Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE) v United Airlines Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-01066.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15%, the S&P 500 gained 0.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.59%. It was the third straight gain for the Dow and fourth-straight for the S&P 500.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 182,000, topping expectations for a 175,000 gain, while average hourly earnings, an important number to gauge inflation, slowed to 0.1% from 0.4% year over year in March.
The mixed jobs report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will stick with its wait-and-see approach on whether to boost interest rates, lifting sentiment on risk assets.
President Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve to take more drastic measures and cut rates.
“I think they should drop rates,” Trump told reporters. “I think they really slowed us down. There’s no inflation.”
The Fed's base federal funds rate is 2.25% to 2.5%.
Sentiment on trade, meanwhile, remained positive with the U.S. and China meeting next week by video conference in a bid to reach a detente on trade, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday.
The U.S. has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) slipped lower in aftermarket hours as the aircraft maker said it would cut its 737 Max production by almost a fifth, beginning in mid-April. This comes as the company continues efforts to finalize a software update for its anti-stall software on the 737 Max following two deadly crashes in recent months. The shares were off 1.8% after hours, following a 1% decline in regular trading. The shares are down more than 13% since peaking at $446.01 on March 1.
The dour update from Boeing arrived after UBS cut their price target on the aircraft maker's stock to $500 from $525, citing concerns about a potential drop in earnings estimates.
""We expect the next few weeks could be a bit more choppy than the last few weeks as the company will report earnings on April 24th and potentially need to make risk-mitigating production decisions (which would drive negative revisions).

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",S&P posts seven-day winning streak as jobs data allay economic fears,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, boosted by better-than-expected job growth in March, which eased concerns of an economic slowdown that have periodically roiled financial markets over the past year.
With Friday's gains, the benchmark S&P 500 has closed higher for seven trading days in a row, its longest winning streak since October 2017.
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs in March, topping the 180,000 new jobs forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Data for February was revised upward to a gain of 33,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 20,000, the smallest gain since September 2017.
The data provided reassurance two weeks after the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes briefly inverted, in what is commonly viewed as a sign of an oncoming recession.
""The yield curve inversion freaked people out, got them thinking about a recession,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management in New York. ""Data like today's takes that off the table.""
However, wage increases slowed in March, leaving the data broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve's decision to suspend its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy.
A dovish Fed along with hopes for a U.S.-China trade agreement have lifted the S&P 500 to its highest level since Oct. 9, putting the index only 1.3% below its record closing high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 40.36 points, or 0.15%, to 26,424.99, the S&P 500 gained 13.35 points, or 0.46%, to 2,892.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 46.91 points, or 0.59%, to 7,938.69.
Stocks across the world also got a lift from President Donald Trump's comments on Thursday that Beijing and Washington were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks. Trump later said he would not predict that a deal will be reached.
Next week, corporate earnings will come into greater focus with major U.S. banks scheduled to report quarterly results. Analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to fall year-over-year for the first time since 2016.
On Friday, energy stocks jumped 1.7%, the biggest percentage gain among S&P 500 sectors, as oil prices firmed after the release of the U.S. jobs data and on expectations that conflict in Libya could tighten supply.
Technology stocks rose 0.4%, rebounding from Thursday's decline as shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose.
Dow Inc shares helped cap gains on the Dow Industrials. The shares dropped 4.1% as J.P. Morgan started coverage of the company, which was spun off from DowDuPont Inc, with an ""underweight"" rating.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares dipped 1.0% after UBS cut its price target and said the preliminary report following last month's fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash pointed to MCAS anti-stall software as a contributor to the crash. The software has also been implicated in the fatal crash in October of a Lion Air 737 MAX jet in Indonesia.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 75 new highs and 23 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.24 billion shares, compared to the 7.33 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 03:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank open to U.S. revamp in merger talks - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it was open to further restructuring of its U.S. investment bank after Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) executives sought clarity on its plans during merger talks, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
The future of the bank's U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year. Speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks last month.
Among the options floated by the bank during the talks were a further scaling back of its U.S. equities business, including prime brokerage services for hedge funds, and reductions at its corporate finance business, the sources said.
Commerzbank wanted reassurances Deutsche Bank was prepared to make deeper cuts at its loss-making U.S. business as a condition of proceeding with the merger talks, the sources said.
The two banks have been in discussions on the potential deal over the past three weeks and a decision on whether to intensify or terminate the discussions is expected as early as this weekend, the sources said. It is unclear how many of the bank's 10,000 strong U.S. employees would be affected by any new cuts. Last year, the bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, including a significant number in New York. In a research note published on Friday, analysts at KBW said Deutsche Bank could cut up to 15 percent of its investment banking staff globally, equivalent to around 2,500 jobs, to achieve cost savings required to make the deal work. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment.
David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he thinks the majority of the cuts would be outside Germany.
""If you want to reduce the pain for the staff in Germany, you have to cut more in New York and, maybe, London also. Deutsche Bank does not have a competitive advantage in investment banking in the United States,"" he said.

Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Christian Sewing, said in a memo to staff last month the bank aimed to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business. Commerzbank's chief executive, Martin Zielke, believes a strong and focused investment bank would be a good addition to the lender, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The German government, which has pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion, wants the combined business to retain an investment bank capable of supporting German companies doing business around the world, the sources said. A tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would give the combined bank a dominant position in its domestic market and improve its cost of funding. However, some analysts believe the deal fails to address Deutsche Bank's biggest problem, its underperforming and capital-intensive U.S. investment bank. Commerzbank has limited investment banking operations so there are few opportunities to generate cost savings in that part of the bank, leaving Deutsche Bank still striving to turn around a business that has weighed on its earnings. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) made big cuts. Deutsche Bank's U.S. business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading. However, the business, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct, has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals.

The bonds have handed investors a 21 percent loss since late February when the Dallas-based company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and said it’s looking at alternatives that may include a sale. That’s by far the worst performance among 61 food and beverage issuers tracked by Bloomberg globally. On average, the group gained 0.9 percent. The company’s shares have done even worse in the same span, plunging 46 percent.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“There’s a secular movement away from fluid milk and toward plant-based alternatives, and the crushing debt load has weighed heavily” on Dean. “They haven’t done a good job diversifying away from that category.”
--Kenneth Shea, BI food & beverage analyst, in an interview
The company didn’t provide a comment when asked about the selloff.
Dean hired Evercore Group LLC to undertake the strategic review, which has no set timetable, including consideration of standalone initiatives, selling assets or forming a joint venture. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). has said it would be unlikely to find a buyer.
The company had already begun consolidating manufacturing and distribution, but has struggled with its turnaround plans, Chief Executive Officer Ralph Scozzafava said in November. Per capita, Americans are drinking 40 percent less milk than they did in 1975.
Dean is the worst-performing stock among North America packaged food producers tracked by Bloomberg in the past year, losing 72 percent. The stock began trading below its book value in November while the peer group fetches an average of 3.1 times book.
The company’s notes due 2023 hit a record low 59.25 cents on the dollar this week, pushing up the yield to 23 percent. That puts it among the 100 most distressed dollar issuers tracked by Bloomberg.
Dean has also faced growing competition from retailers offering private-label products, with some even selling milk at a loss to lure consumers to their stores, Shea said. “If you have a branded product, how do you compete against that?”

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>","Gol, LATAM bids for Avianca Brasil assets may hit antitrust snag","By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A new plan by cash-strapped carrier Avianca Brasil to sell its most coveted airport slots to Brazil's two largest airlines will draw intense antitrust scrutiny, which may delay or derail a pressing cash injection.
Antitrust regulator CADE said on Friday that it could block the plan, which Avianca Brasil hopes could raise some $210 million later this month. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in December.
Under the plan, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and LATAM Airlines Group would buy Avianca Brasil's airport rights, known as slots, in three high-traffic terminals in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Gol and LATAM already control over two-thirds of the slots in each of those three airports.
Representatives for LATAM, Avianca Brasil and Gol did not respond to requests for comment. 
Avianca Brasil's plan would raise much-needed funds but is high-risk, lawyers said, and could leave it hanging without quick cash. Creditors will vote later on Friday whether to approve the plan which would allow Gol and LATAM to bid on the assets.
Avianca Brasil would not receive any funds until CADE greenlights the operation, said antitrust lawyer Tatiana Lins Cruz in an interview on Thursday. She said CADE could take up to eight months to analyze a case in which buyers already control more than 20 percent of a given market.
Meanwhile, the airline would have to continue operations with its own money. But Avianca Brasil has been so cash-strapped that it fell behind its payroll in March.
A person familiar with LATAM's thinking said the airlines hoped CADE would approve the deals because they only involve a modest increase in their presence at Brazil's busiest airports.
AZUL SIDELINED
The new plan is a setback for rival Azul SA, which ranks as Brazil's third largest airline and has a small presence in those three airports. In Sao Paulo's domestic Congonhas airport, Gol and LATAM already control a combined 92 percent of the slots, whereas Azul has just 3 percent.
Azul had struck a preliminary deal with Avianca Brasil to take over the slots for $105 million and had already provided some $8 million so the carrier could meet its March payroll. 
But that deal was off once Gol and LATAM came in. 
CADE appeared to take a more positive view of an Azul takeover on Friday. 
""A scenario where Azul becomes the buyer represents a lower antitrust concern than in a scenario with LATAM or Gol,"" the regulator said in its report.
The plan could also draw scrutiny from Brazil's civil aviation regulator, because airport slots are not meant to be bought and sold. Azul was planning to buy Avianca Brasil's assets as a single airline, but the new plan would create seven different companies, each holding little more than slots. 

""In our view, it is not clear whether the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) will approve this new structure,"" wrote analysts at Brazil bank Bradesco BBI in a note to clients.

Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) has been riding high on flavored malt beverage and cider innovations launched last year, both of which ensured frothy sales were on tap. But with competition set to crank up a notch, Goldman Sachs suggests it's time to ditch the beer goggles on Boston Beer and downgraded its shares to a sell rating. The shares fell 7.7% by 1:35 p.m. ET. Friday and are off nearly 18% since March 11. 
""While SAM has seen its overall sales growth accelerate on the back of its FMB and cider innovations in 2018, we downgrade SAM to Sell and see headwinds in 2019 as competition intensiﬁes and the company is unlikely to repeat its innovation success again this year,"" Goldman Sachs said.
While Boston Beer is seemingly heading down a wobbly path, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) appears to be on a solid footing and could see its sales pick up pace if its flavored malt beverage innovations prove a hit, the bank said. Fourth-quarter earnings, released Thursday, easily beat estimates.
""We favor STZ within our Alcoholic Beverage coverage as its core beer portfolio remains on a solid footing, and there is potential upside to sales if its FMB innovations (i.e. Corona Refresca) proves to be more successful,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added. 
But not everyone agrees. Deutsche Bank downgraded Constellation Brands to hold from buy on worries that the stock has little room for upside. The shares were off 0.3% on Friday but are up more than 18% this year.
""We raise our target price to $194 (largely on account of the earlier wine transaction, as well as a lower go-forward tax rate), but are downgrading the stock to Hold as we see current valuation now more fully pricing in our base case fundamentals,"" Deutsche bank said."
1383,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: United States sets sights on China in new electric vehicle push,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - U.S. government officials plan to meet with executives from automakers and lithium miners in early May as part of a first-of-its-kind effort to launch a national electric vehicle supply chain strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
While Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other electric-focused automakers and battery manufacturers are expanding in the United States and investing billions in the new technology, they are reliant on mineral imports without a major push to develop more domestic mines and processing facilities.

China already dominates the electric vehicle supply chain. It produces nearly two-thirds of the world's lithium-ion batteries - compared to 5 percent for the United States - and controls most of the world's lithium processing facilities, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, which tracks prices for lithium and other commodities and is organizing the Washington, D.C., event.
U.S. imports of lithium have nearly doubled since 2014 due in part to rising demand from Tesla, SK Innovation Co and others building battery plants in the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 
""We need to find ways to more efficiently develop our nation's domestic critical mineral supply because these resources are vital to both our national security and our economy,"" North Dakota Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement to Reuters when asked about the meeting. 
Hoeven and Senator Lisa Murkowski, chair of the Senate's energy committee, have been invited to attend the meeting. Officials from the U.S. Department of State, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey plan to attend, according to two of the sources.
As part of the effort, Murkowski is expected to introduce standalone legislation aimed at streamlining the permitting process for lithium and other mines, bolstering state and federal studies of domestic supplies of critical minerals and encouraging mineral recycling, among other topics, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Some of those efforts were part of broader energy legislation in prior Congresses that failed, and Murkowski hopes that similar legislation will draw broader attention to the topic, according to the source. 
Five companies, including Lithium Americas Corp, are developing U.S. lithium projects that plan to use new technologies to extract the metal from clays, bromine and even oilfield waste, processes not common elsewhere and considered game-changing by some analysts. But not all of them have secured financing. 
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CXdGWN
If all five come online by 2022 as planned, the country would produce at least 77,900 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent each year, making the country one of the world's largest lithium producers. Lithium development projects have historically faced numerous obstacles, so that production number is far from guaranteed.
""Creating a domestic electric vehicle supply chain is the perfect blueprint to make America great again,"" said Jesse Edmondson, chief executive officer of U.S. Critical Minerals, a start-up firm buying lithium mineral rights in the U.S. Southeast.
Representatives from Tesla, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plan to attend the Washington meeting and discuss with federal officials potential policy changes that could encourage development of a domestic supply chain to mine, process and supply lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite for battery manufacturers and automakers, according to the sources.
Tesla and GM did not respond to requests for comment.
A Ford spokesperson said that the company regularly engages with stakeholders on various supply chain topics. 
Albemarle Corp and Livent Corp, two U.S.-based companies that mine lithium in South America, also plan to attend, as do executives from the handful of lithium mines under development in the United States, according to the sources.
""We are looking forward to participating in a forum with policy makers and industry participants who are focused on ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the development of the electric vehicle industry,"" said Paul Graves, CEO of Livent, which has said it is eyeing expansion opportunities.
Albemarle, which operates the only existing lithium mine in the United States, declined to comment.
The one-day meeting will be divided into morning workshops focused on financing and permitting obstacles, with one-on-one afternoon meetings between regulators and industry executives, according to the sources. 
""We're trying to make sure policymakers have an understanding of this complex situation,"" said James Calaway, chairman of ioneer Ltd, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada that also hold a large concentration of boron, used in a plethora of consumer goods. 
In Arkansas, Standard Lithium Ltd is developing a pilot project to extract lithium from the bromine waste of a  Lanxess  AG (DE:LXSG) chemical facility.
""We have an opportunity to take a huge step forward in lithium production, and we want to support that,"" Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas, told Reuters. 
Hutchinson and some other U.S. officials want U.S. lithium projects to stand alone without financial support from the government, a potential impediment as financiers often look for even tacit government support before investing in new, unproven technologies.

""There's a real opportunity in the electric vehicle supply chain if the United States wakes up,"" said Jonathan Evans, president of Lithium Americas, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada expected to open by 2022.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>","Deutsche, Commerzbank favor merger over holding company structure: sources","By Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) favor a straightforward merger over more complex ways to structure a deal, three people close to the matter said.
In their base case scenario, a transaction would be organized as a share offer from Deutsche Bank for Commerzbank, they said. That structure is preferred to the creation of a new holding company, which is viewed as too difficult to execute.
""The holding structure is dead,"" one of the people said, referring to setting up a holding company that would buy Deutsche and Commerzbank in return for shares of the new bank.
Sources said last year that Deutsche Bank was examining creating a holding company structure amid speculation at the time that it could merge with Commerzbank.
Last month the two banks confirmed they were in talks about a merger. A preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward is expected within days.
The people cautioned that no decision has yet been taken on a potential deal structure and there is still no certainty that a deal will be struck at all. 
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
Regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland tend to favor the bank holding company structure, in part because it can help with the winding down of a troubled bank. 
There has been a push since the financial crash to make banks easier to break up, lowering the risk that the problems of a troubled investment bank, for instance, could affect ordinary savers.
About 90 percent of U.S. banks, including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), operate as holding companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
But converting to a holding company structure can be costly.
In Deutsche and Commerzbank's case, defining the relative value of the two banks for a holding structure would be more complicated than simply negotiating a price for a simple takeover, the sources said.
As part of a deal, Deutsche Bank will be asked by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds to plug capital holes resulting from asset revaluations and expected restructuring costs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this week.
Issues around regulatory capital - and how to make use of the fact that Commerzbank trades well below book level, which can be used to boost such capital - are a talking point between the two banks. 
Other issues focus on synergies, job cuts as well as legal and tax issues, people familiar with the matter have said.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Big banks to report first quarter results with lowered expectations,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will focus on falling profits, a more dovish Federal Reserve and lower interest rates as major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016.
On Friday, April 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co will post results to begin the earnings season in earnest.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Tuesday.
In the wake of the Federal Reserve's cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data.
(For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HOVt1D)
""The Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they're saying about the economy,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""Flat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It's not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.""
The central bank's change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.
Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond's yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.
""That's why the estimates are going down,"" Carlson added. ""(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there's an underlying concern about loan growth.""
In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.
Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings ""recession"" that ended in 2016. 
The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates. 
In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter. 
""Within financials, the industry that's been hit hardest is capital markets,"" said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. ""Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines"" in first-quarter earnings estimates.
But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.
Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note ""to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings."" But he called the impact from the Fed's decision ""a minor one,"" and wrote that aside from these impacts, ""bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.""
Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500's 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.
For a graphic on U.S. banks beat/miss track record, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Vmv2DP 
In today's late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period. 

""Psychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,"" Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. ""Banks are up there.""

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 12:18PM ET</span>","EU, Rome agree draft deal to soften bail-in rules on Italy banks: source","By Francesco Guarascio
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The Italian government and the European Commission have reached a provisional agreement to reimburse some investors who bought shares in failed banks, an Italian official said, in an unprecedented move that would soften EU rules on bank rescues.
The bail-in rules devised after the last decade's financial crisis were designed to make any given bank and its creditors - instead of taxpayers - financially responsible if it went bust, with shareholders first in line to pay up.
Since the regulations came into force in 2016, shareholders have been all but wiped out in all bank collapses, including Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and two smaller north-eastern banks that Italian authorities intervened to save in 2017.
Losses have also been inflicted on bondholders in some cases, while depositors have always been spared.
But under the new provisional deal between Brussels and Rome, bondholders and shareholders of failed Italian banks could claim their money back, the official from the Italian finance ministry said.
""The Commission is in constructive contact with Italy on the proposed measures,"" the EU commissioner for financial services Valdis Dombrovskis said, declining to comment further.
Under the agreement, shareholders with annual incomes below 35,000 euros ($39,280) and assets worth less than 100,000 euros would be automatically compensated for their losses in past bank rescues, the official said.
The deal would notably benefit Italian savers forced to buy bank shares in exchange for mortgages in what appears to have been fraudulent transactions, but its critics say it is unlikely that all those entitled to claim compensation under the wealth criterion were victims of swindling.
In a March ruling that has been interpreted as a softening of the bail-in rules, EU judges overturned a decision the European Commission took in 2014 to block the rescue of Tercas, a small Italian bank, with money from the country's depositor fund. 
While Brussels could appeal that ruling, the deal with Italy would further weaken the legal framework.
The agreement would need to be approved by the two parties in Italy's euroskeptic government, which is campaigning for EU elections in May. 
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants even softer terms to compensate those who were allegedly missold bank shares and bonds, an Italian official said. It and the co-ruling far-right League pressed for generous compensation for bank creditors before last year's national elections in Italy.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 12:18PM ET</span>",Lyft's shares rise after Citron advises against shorting stock,"(Reuters) - Shares of ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) rose as much as 4 percent on Friday, setting the stock for its best day since its market debut last week, after short-seller Citron Research advised investors to hold on to the stock.
The number of active Lyft riders has surged fivefold to 18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, from the first quarter of 2016, and those numbers are set to rise further, Citron said, listing several other reasons to not be short on Lyft.
As of Thursday, Lyft's short interest was $937 million, with 13.38 million shares shorted, which makes up about 41.2 percent of its float, according to data from S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm.
Citron, which has held a stake in Lyft for the last two years, said it has increased its position in the company in the open market.
Describing ride-sharing as a ""megatrend"", and not just a fad, Citron said Lyft has good prospects, especially since millennials are foregoing car ownership for ride-sharing.
""This is not a trendy video game or a GoPro camera... this is a way of life that is saving people time and ensuring safety,"" the note said.
""The entire rideshare market in the U.S. only accounts for 1 percent of miles traveled today…. we have only just begun,"" Citron said.
But brokerage Seaport Global, which started coverage on Lyft with a ""sell"" rating on Tuesday, said it was skeptical that consumers will give up car ownership in favor of relying on ride-hailing services.
Daiwa Capital Markets also initiated coverage on the company on Thursday, with an 'outperform' rating and a price target of $80. 
The rating reflects strong revenue growth potential ahead for the company, the brokerage said, but added it expects losses to increase through 2020, and then reach break even by the end of 2022.
Lyft's shares fell below their IPO price of $72 on their second day of trading, erasing all debut gains, after market research companies cited lack of a clear path to profitability. 
The company did not mention when it would turn profitable. It reported a loss of $911 million in 2018, wider than its $688 million loss in 2017, despite revenue doubling in 2018 to $2.16 billion.

Daiwa added autonomous robotaxis, currently under development at tech and auto companies, are among the biggest threats to the company.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cboe has decided to offer trading in all shares in London and Amsterdam following a row between regulators over where shares can be traded if Britain leaves the EU on April 12 without securing a delay or a transition deal with Brussels.
Europe's biggest cross-border share trading platform said if there is no deal, trading in British and Swiss securities will continue on its British platform, but trading in European Economic Area instruments - mainly euro denominated stocks - will cease and shift to Amsterdam.
""In the event that this happens it is Cboe's intention to re-introduce trading in European Economic Area instruments on its UK venue during 2019,"" Cboe said on Friday.
Cboe said that if there is a long delay to Brexit or that a deal is negotiated, it would not start up in Amsterdam until it is able to offer trading in all securities on both its British and Dutch venues, which is likely to be later in 2019.
This marks a shift at Cboe, which accounts for nearly a fifth of pan-European share trading.
Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said in January the exchange would only trade EEA stocks in Amsterdam, with British and Swiss shares limited to London. 
This would avoid splitting liquidity in euro, Swiss or UK shares between two centers which could damage prices, he said.
The bloc's markets watchdog ESMA surprised exchanges last month by saying that if there is a no-deal Brexit, more than 6,200 shares, including 14 British stocks, could only be traded on a platform inside the bloc.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority was angered by what one exchange official described as a ""land grab"" by an EU keen to build up its capital market.
Exchange officials are now waiting to see if the FCA will hit back and rule that under a no-deal Brexit, UK and some European shares could only be traded in Britain.
Cboe's revised Brexit strategy means that its customers across Europe have a venue to trade all shares.
The London Stock Exchange's pan-European trading platform Turquoise has set up a hub in Amsterdam, while rival Aquis Exchange chose Paris. 
""Up until now, we all believed we would be trading euro shares in Europe and UK and Swiss shares in the UK,"" Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange said.
""Ever since the ESMA share trading obligation (STO) and a potential STO from the FCA, which people think is highly likely to happen, then you are going to have to split liquidity,"" Haynes said.
""This is extremely bad news for end investor, but politically, people want to fight for territory here.""

The groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Netherlands, handed over a court summons to Shell at its headquarters in The Hague, demanding it stop extracting oil and gas and cut its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
""Shell spends billions on oil and gas exploration each year, with current plans to invest just 5 percent of its budget in sustainable energy and 95 percent in exploiting fossil fuels,"" the groups said. 
They said Shell's plans were ""incompatible with the goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming"" under the goals set out in the Paris Agreement to combat climate change.
Shell on Friday said the case should not be brought to court as it supports the goals of the 2015 pact and has promised to cut its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050.
""We also feel action against climate change is needed right now"", the company said in a statement. 
""We have invested billions of dollars in a range of CO2-light technologies, such as biofuels, hydrogen and wind energy and we want to continue to grow these activities."" 
Activists say this commitment does not go far enough to ensure climate goals can be reached on a global scale.
""With their current strategy, they will keep the world dependent on fossil fuels in the next 40 years,"" Greenpeace campaigner Eefje de Kroon said. 
The groups said more than 17,000 Dutch citizens signed up to support their case against Shell.
The company has about six weeks to reply to the court summons, after which a judge will decide on further proceedings.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) said on Friday that more than half of its branch network will be modernized over the next three years to respond to changing consumer behavior.
The second largest U.S. bank by assets will renovate 2,500 retail financial services centers with more interactive technology and a layout that accommodates longer visits for customers who have more complex needs. 
""We have been very encouraged by the initial results of our center redesigns and expansions,"" Aron Levine, head of Consumer Banking & Investments for Bank of America told Reuters. ""This work has enabled us to have more in-depth conversations with our clients about their financial plans and priorities."" 
The announcement accelerates plans put in place last year to redesign 1,500 centers. Bank of America also said it planned to upgrade its network of 16,000 ATMs to allow customers to pay credit card bills and withdraw cash with their phones, and install an additional 2,700 machines.
By 2021, Bank of America's branch and ATM network will cover more than 90 percent of the U.S. population, said David Tyrie, head of consumer advanced solutions and digital banking.
The percentage of customers who prefer to make their transactions in brick and mortar banks fell to 26 percent from 38 percent in 2016, according to a study published this year by consulting firm McKinsey. However, the firm found that banks that closed a significant number of branches must rely more heavily on advertising to win market share. 
For many years banks have been paring back their branch networks due to dwindling foot traffic as more and more people opt to handle routine transactions online. But over the past year some banks have announced plans to expand again.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said on Friday that it will expand its retail banking presence in two new markets, Cleveland and Lexington, Kentucky, next year as part of a previously announced pledge to add 500 branches. 
The expansion is expected to add up to 5,500 jobs in local markets, the bank said Friday.
Last year, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, started adding bank branches in new cities for the first time in nearly a decade. The bank, which has roughly 5,000 branches nationwide, said it would open locations in new cities and markets such as Boston, Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. 
By 2022, 93 percent of the U.S. population will be in JPMorgan’s “Chase footprint,” Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in his 2019 annual letter to shareholders. 

Bank of America has about 4,300 branches, according to its most recent filing, down more than 1,000 from its peak.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. security concerns about 5G mobile networks built by Chinese telecoms giant Huawei appear to be driven by politics and trade rather than any evidence, the head of the U.N. internet and telecoms agency said on Friday.
Houlin Zhao, secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), told reporters in Geneva that security of 5G networks was in everybody's interest but so far he had not seen anything to substantiate claims about Huawei. 
""Those preoccupations with Huawei’s equipment, up to now there is no proof so far,"" Zhao said. 
The United States has urged its allies to ban Huawei from building 5G networks, saying it could be used for espionage. Huawei has rubbished the allegations, saying Washington had a ""loser's attitude"". 
""I would encourage Huawei to be given equal opportunities to bid for business, and during the operational process, if you find anything wrong, then you can charge them and accuse them,"" the Chinese-born Zhao said. ""But if we don’t have anything then to put them on the blacklist – I think this is not fair.""
Zhao was speaking on the day South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) won the race to commercially launch 5G services, saying 5G-enabled smartphone Galaxy S10 would allow games to be played with minimal delay, potentially changing the landscape of the gaming industry.
Zhao said it was in the interest of telecoms companies to ensure that they were using secure hardware, because otherwise they could face a challenge by national authorities or a public backlash against using their services. 
""So it’s their first concern, their first target, to make sure that the systems they use in the market will provide service satisfaction to them."" 
The ITU will hold a meeting in October to finalize standards for the 5G spectrum, but concerns about Huawei will not slow down that process, Zhao said. 
The ITU also has a study group of national experts looking into security. 
""Up to now we don’t have any proposal from anybody on 5G security concerns there,"" Zhao said.

The study group includes an official from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as well as an official from Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp (HK:0763).

A stronger-than-expected gain in nonfarm payrolls helped lift sentiment as the economy appears to have shaken off the winter blues.
Still, average hourly earnings grew at a slower rate than anticipated, which supports the Federal Reserve’s extension of its pause on interest rate hikes.

Activist funds are increasingly active in Europe, buying up stakes in companies they feel are underperforming and pushing for changes in strategy to extract more value for shareholders. 
The practice has been common in the U.S. for many years but slower to take off in Europe as big stakes held by founding families or even the state proved a deterrent.
In France, New York hedge fund Elliott Management is currently piling pressure on drinks giant  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), CIAM is tussling with reinsurer Scor, Amber Capital has acquired a stake in Lagardere and Searchlight Capital Partners said earlier this week it was investing in aeronautics company Latecoere. 
""I am thinking about new national instruments that would make it possible to better resist activist funds,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters in Bucharest, where he was attending an EU finance ministers meeting.
The plan would make it possible for the state to invest in companies it deemed to be of national interest, he said, declining to give further details other than saying the proposals would be ready in the coming months.
""It's a subject I follow very closely because an activist fund that destroys value does not conform with the new capitalism I want to build,"" he added.
Le Maire has championed an overhaul of French corporate law encouraging long-term investment and employee profit-sharing schemes. Parliament is due to vote on the legislation next week.
Le Maire said there was a place for investment funds which helped improve a company's performance, but activist funds that destroyed longer-term value by trying to boost short-term profitability ""should be fought"".
Elliott's campaign to improve profit margins and corporate governance at Pernod has fueled concerns that no company is immune.
Not only does the group's founding family hold a large stake, it is generally considered to be well managed already.
Last month, France's Bpifrance pubic investment bank said it had 2 billion euros available to fend off potential activist attacks on French firms if needed.
Through the bank, the French government last week increased its stake in car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), which has previously been targeted by activist investors. 

Valeo also currently counts among its shareholders Chicago-based activist Harris Associates, which after Bpifrance's move said it supported management.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Tokyo court approved on Friday a request by prosecutors to detain Carlos Ghosn for 10 days for further questioning, rejecting an appeal by the ousted Nissan boss' lawyer to free him as he fights charges against financial misconduct.
The Tokyo District Court said it had approved the request by prosecutors to detain Ghosn until April 14. The decision was widely expected after prosecutors arrested Ghosn for the fourth time at his Tokyo apartment on Thursday.
Prosecutors re-arrested Ghosn on suspicion the former Nissan Motor and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) boss had tried to enrich himself to the tune of $5 million at Nissan's expense.
In a statement on Thursday, Ghosn said he was innocent of the ""groundless charges and accusations"" against him. The once-feted executive, who has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, also called the latest arrest an attempt to silence him.
The Ghosn scandal has rocked the global auto industry and strained ties between Nissan and its global alliance partner Renault.
It has also shone a harsh light on Japan's judicial system.
Thursday's arrest came 30 days after Ghosn was released on $9 million bail from a Tokyo detention center. Legal experts have characterized the move as rare for someone already released on bail.

Under Japanese law, prosecutors can seek an extension of another 10 days of detention before they must either bring formal charges against suspects or let them go.

The draft proposal was put out for comment by the finance ministry until July 12.
""The additional requirements for funds ... amounts to some 24 billion Swiss francs for the two big banks,"" the draft proposal said, noting UBS and Credit Suisse would gradually have to issue this amount of additional bail-in bonds at the holding level. 
""As a result, the refinancing costs for both big banks will increase by a maximum of 170 million francs a year,"" it added, although it called this a conservative estimate that could shrink toward zero as markets reward with lower risk premiums banks' greater capacity to absorb losses.
UBS and Credit Suisse had no immediate comment on the plan, which still has to be finalised and approved by parliament. 
The proposal comes amid international efforts to ensure banks have enough capital to withstand losses amid market turbulence without state aid.
UBS and Credit Suisse have operated under so-called ""gone concern"" rules since 2016, with scaled-down requirements for other big lenders PostFinance, Raiffeisen and ZKB since this year. 
The draft released on Friday also suggests tightening capital requirements for loans that finance investments in Swiss residential property amid concerns that the sector is overheating given ultra-low Swiss interest rates.
But it suggests the government forego changes should banks come up with a self-regulation approach that wins approval from the FINMA watchdog.

The demand for disclosure has been sent by the Church of England Pensions Board and the Swedish Council on Ethics following meetings in March and on April 1. The investors will meet again in May.
They are asking companies to disclose on their websites within 45 days answers to 20 questions, covering issues such as the height of dams, their volume, engineering records and safety checks.
If they cannot provide the requested information, they have to state what action they are taking to address the situation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators on Friday charged BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) with colluding to block the rollout of emissions cleaning technology in a move that could lead to hefty fines. 
In the latest emissions scandal to hit the auto industry, the European Commission said it had sent so-called statements of objections to the companies setting out the charges, nearly two years after carrying out dawn raids at their premises.
It said the collusion occurred between 2006 to 2014 and took place during the carmakers' technical meetings.
""Daimler, VW and BMW may have broken EU competition rules. As a result, European consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The EU focus is on selective catalytic reduction systems to reduce harmful nitrogen oxides emissions of diesel passenger cars through the injection of urea, which is also called AdBlue, in the exhaust gas stream.
It is also concerned about potential collusion on ""Otto"" particle filters to reduce harmful particle emissions from exhaust gases of petrol passenger cars.
Daimler, which alerted the collusion to the regulator, reiterated it did not expect to be fined as a result of its information. BMW and Volkswagen could not immediately be reached for comment. 

EU fines could go as high as 10 percent of a company's global turnover.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Mergers in Europe's fragmented banking sector are necessary to make the sector more resilient as the euro zone seeks to protect itself from future crises, France's finance minister told Reuters in an interview.
Bruno Le Maire, who joined President Emmanuel Macron's centrist government in 2017 despite coming from the ranks of France's conservative Republicans party, said banking sector consolidation was needed alongside a single regulatory supervisor and more integrated capital markets.
""I consider that today European banks are still too fragmented and we need banking consolidation,"" Le Maire said in Bucharest, where he was attending a meeting of EU finance ministers. 
Speaking with Reuters over dinner at an upmarket restaurant in the Romanian capital, Le Maire declined comment on specific deals. The biggest operation underway currently is a possible tie-up between German lenders  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Despite persistent speculation, sometimes involving French banks, there have been few cross-border bank mergers in recent years in Europe, even though the European Central Bank has repeatedly urged consolidation, which it believes would ensure that credit flows to where it is needed most.
Le Maire, who has attended some of France's most prestigious schools and held numerous senior posts in government, said the euro zone needed to finalize in coming months plans for a backstop for banks saddled with bad loans, and better integrate capital markets notably by agreeing to harmonize insolvency laws - a sensitive issue for some countries.
""If euro zone member states are not capable of taking certain steps forward in the coming months, we risk weakening the euro and seeing new fractures emerge in the euro zone,"" Le Maire said.
Policymakers like IMF chief Christine Lagarde have warned that the euro zone's financial sector remains dangerously exposed to shocks if it does not quickly complete reforms designed to keep risks contained.
Le Maire also wants the euro zone to quickly thrash out plans for a shared budget aimed at encouraging convergence among the euro zone's economies. In particular, details on its governance and how it sits in relation to the broader EU budget remain to be hammered out. 
ECONOMIC DIVERGENCE
""The euro zone will not survive growing economic divergences between member states. We have to equip ourselves with the instruments to reduce the divergences,"" he said. 
France, along with Germany, has championed the idea of a euro zone budget, but has had to scale down its ambitions in the face of resistance from the Dutch. 
The Netherlands has rejected the idea that the budget has a capacity to help member states facing economic shocks, fearing this would mean transfers from richer to poorer countries.
With EU parliament elections due in May, the staunchly pro-Europe minister weighed into the debate about the future of the Union this week with a book warning that Europe must guarantee it does not fall behind China and the United States on technological progress, or risks being dominated by them.
Le Maire, who alongside Germany's economy minister in February released an industrial policy manifesto calling for increased investment in technology research, revised antitrust and state aid rules and stronger defenses against foreign takeovers, said EU state aid rules needed to be more flexible.
He said approval of aid for projects had to come much more quickly, otherwise companies would look beyond Europe to meet their needs. ""Speed is of the essence ... There are companies that need technology and they are going to get it where they find it.""
The minister has also called for an overhaul of antitrust rules after the European Commission blocked the planned merger of the rail businesses of Siemens and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), seeing such tie-ups as necessary to build European champions.

""What do we want tomorrow for our telecommunications, our trains, our banks or our cars? I want that in all these fields we keep our European (industrial) capacities, which has to happen through consolidation.""

1417,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",‘Baby Bonds’ Could Help the U.S. Wealth Gap,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- Wealth inequality—and specifically the yawning racial wealth gap (the median black family has about one-tenth the net worth of a white household)—is a thorny challenge for U.S. policymakers. One solution increasingly discussed by progressive politicians but seen as lacking popular support would be for the government to pay reparations to black Americans for the wealth lost during generations of slavery and discrimination. Duke University professor William “Sandy” Darity and his onetime student Darrick Hamilton, currently serving as director of Ohio State University’s Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, have proposed an interim step dubbed “baby bonds.” The bonds, averaging $25,000 but rising to as much as $60,000 for the poorest children, would be federally managed to increase by a guaranteed annual rate of 2 percent. The cost of up to $100 billion would be less than 3 percent of the U.S. budget. As they explain to Bloomberg News’s Matthew Boesler, the bonds would seek to minimize the wealth disparity between the richest and the poorest, regardless of race.
Matthew Boesler: What are baby bonds, and how would they work?
Sandy Darity: The language “baby bonds” is kind of a cute touch that was inspired for us by the late [Columbia University professor] Manning Marable. But really what we’re talking about is a trust account—a federally funded trust account—for each young person that they could access when they reach young adulthood.
Darrick Hamilton: It basically is about setting up an account at birth, seeded with an endowment, based on the wealth position one is born into. That can be used when you become a young adult toward some asset-enhancing endeavor, like a debt-free education, or as capital to purchase a home or start a business. The source of inequality is, especially at the median, determined by the fact that some Americans have access to some seed capital to put into an asset that will passively appreciate over their life. And I think the key word is passive. It has very little to do with something behavioral. They have some capital with which they can take part in the financial markets.
MB: How does race play into this?
SD: Well, it doesn’t necessarily have to play into this at all. You could have a policy that’s race-neutral, or universal, but it might be race-conscious in the sense that it could disproportionately benefit a group that’s more significantly deprived of the resource. It might go some way toward mitigating the racial wealth gap, but it’s not going to close the racial wealth gap.
DH: Usually, when we talk about the racial wealth gap, it’s examining the median position of a group. Now, it is the case that wealth is so unevenly distributed in America that, at the mean, we would definitely need something specific and even more dramatic than baby bonds if we were to close the racial wealth gap at the mean.
SD: And that’s where I think a program of reparations comes into play, that if your target is the overall wealth gap between blacks and whites, then you need a reparations program. The baby bonds program would not be sufficient.
MB: The Federal Reserve and other institutions have been publishing more and more data on racial disparities in economic outcomes. Is this feeding into the conversation?
DH: It’s a combination of the quality of data and the specificity of certain types of data: Simply having a data point like $8 in net worth in Boston for the typical black household [vs. $247,500 for the median white household there, according to a 2015 report from Duke, the New School, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston] can reverberate in many settings, including the halls of Congress. So, when Elizabeth Warren cites that statistic, I’d say that that is an indicator of success.
MB: Where did the idea for the baby bonds proposal come from?
DH: I focused exclusively on middle-income blacks and found that poverty in the family was a drain on their ability to acquire wealth relative to white families. We both went to elite environments but were in networks of poverty. Our peers were receiving support from their families, whereas we’d have conversations around all of the checks we’d have to write, the issues in our families. The resources were going the other way. So rather than receiving support, we were offering support. It led to the work that Sandy and I have been doing around the role of one’s birth position in the ability to generate assets, which is a big source of economic security. If we really want to address racial wealth gaps, it really is tied to the family position into which an individual is born.
SD: Racial wealth inequality is actually far more pronounced than general inequality, but general inequality in wealth is atrocious as well in the U.S. What’s the figure? A tenth of a percent of the persons in the overall wealth distribution own 40 percent of the nation’s wealth? I think that’s absolutely outrageous. So in a way you could argue that the baby bonds proposal is a dramatic change from the status quo, but it’s not going to dramatically overturn the wealth distribution. What it will do is create a different floor for the resources every young person has.
MB: How would it be paid for?
SD: I am somewhat of an enthusiast for the MMT [Modern Monetary Theory] perspective. From that standpoint, the real barrier to expanded government spending isn’t tax revenue [because the U.S. government can print more money]. It’s the inflation risk. A carefully designed program would take into account the potential dimensions of inflation risk, and I think that risk is lower to the degree that the focus is on asset-building as opposed to designing the funds so they’re utilized for immediate expenditure.
As the MMTers see it, the companion argument is that the expenditures could ultimately generate the taxes to support the activity. So they do the flip: Instead of pay-as-you-go, you go, and you pay.
MB: How has the African American community been affected by economic policy relative to the white community in America over the last 50 years?
SD: On virtually any indicator of relative position, there really has not been any significant change, particularly if it’s an economic indicator. And over that 50-year period, I think our best estimates of the wealth gap indicate that it actually has worsened.
MB: Baby bonds are a debt instrument. Do you connect the idea of baby bonds to the idea that it’s literally and figuratively an obligation of society to a specific group of people based on what came before?
DH: Given that America is not ready for race-specific policies politically, what can we do about the racial wealth gap? Like Sandy, I’m an advocate of reparations, and I think that it will happen. But there’s actually stuff you can do that is race-neutral but will have disparate racial impact. And I would say that it is very much couched in a lot of the policies that came about from the New Deal, as well as post-World War II, including assistance in homeownership, etc. We need to be race-conscious in a way that’s the opposite of what those policies were. They were exclusionary toward blacks.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Major UK financial firms make little progress on gender pay gap,"By Carolyn Cohn and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Major financial services firms in Britain have made very little progress in narrowing the gap between male and female pay and more than a third have gone backwards, a Reuters analysis of gender pay data shows.
Financial firms have on average reduced pay disparities by just over half a percentage point in the last year, the analysis of 89 of the biggest companies showed, highlighting the lack of progress in the sector with the worst average pay gap in Britain.
The poor figures come despite finance companies publicizing a raft of initiatives to close the gap, from hiring more women in senior roles to mandating mixed gender shortlists and promoting flexible working.
Pay disparities in Britain have come under the spotlight since the government forced businesses to submit gender pay gap figures annually from last year.
The data shows the difference between average hourly male and female pay, and tends to reflect the smaller number of women at senior levels, where financial services firms have a poor record. 
Reuters surveyed 89 major banks, asset managers, hedge funds, insurers and other financial services firms in Britain, including all the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 financial services firms that had reported gender pay data by Thursday.
On average, the firms showed a narrowing in the mean gender pay gap of just 0.6 percentage points compared with a year earlier, the survey showed. 
For a graphic on UK financial sector gender pay gap, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2I3vy6C 
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2HYgZkH. 
Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the former chief executive of Virgin Money (LON:VM), who runs the government-backed Women in Finance charter, criticized finance firms for not doing enough.
""Businesses need to realize that they will not succeed unless they embrace diversity as a key driver of results and growth,"" she said. 
""They need to focus on it, measure it, set targets and hold senior executives accountable for making progress - year in year out.""
Virgin Money - which was bought by rival CYBG last year - had itself faced criticism for reporting a wide gender pay gap of 32.5 percent for 2017. The bank narrowed the gap to 29.7 percent last year.
Only three firms had a gender pay gap below last year's mean national average. 
Fifteen of the 48 major British, U.S. and other international banks surveyed reported a widening in the gender pay gap of their UK employees, and 32 of all the firms did so.
Firms with more than 250 employees in Britain had until April 5 to submit gender pay data, the second year of this government requirement.
The overall mean hourly gender pay gap based on employers who reported in 2018 was 14.3 percent, according to government data, but that widened to 30 percent for the financial sector according to an Investment Association (IA) study published this week. 
In addition to a ""motherhood penalty"" and behavioral biases, the IA said that in financial services, there were ""limitations in real meritocracy"". 
HSBC had the biggest gender pay gap of the companies surveyed, at 61 percent, a widening of two percentage points from a year ago.
""We are committed to improving our gender balance and recognize that this will require sustained focus over the long-term,"" the bank said in a statement. 
It added it was taking a number of specific steps, including an ""aspirational target"" for 30 percent of senior leadership roles to be filled by women by 2020. On this measure, it said it had progressed from 22 percent in 2012 to 28.2 percent at the end of 2018.
Within some of the companies looked at, individual operating units performed particularly badly.
Across all the firms surveyed,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, the asset management arm of custody bank State Street, showed a year-on-year widening in the pay gap of 13.9 percentage points. The overall bank, though, saw a 0.1 percentage point reduction.
""While we have made significant on-going efforts to improve, we recognize that there is much more work to be done,"" a spokeswoman for State Street said.
FTSE 100 asset manager  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) was most successful in narrowing its pay gap, more than halving it to 13.7 percent from 28.8 percent, which the firm attributed to hiring more women in its third to sixth tiers of seniority although it noted its median gap rose.

Consumer credit firm Provident Financial's home credit division had the smallest gender pay gap, at 4.9 percent.

(Reuters) - European shares were flat on Friday as investors waited for concrete progress in trade talks between China and the United States ahead of a closely-watched U.S. jobs report.
The pan-region STOXX 600 index was little changed at 0915 GMT, set for its best weekly rise in three weeks.
Bourses in the region were mixed with Britain's FTSE 100 edging higher while Germany's tariff-sensitive DAX dipped.
German industrial output rose in February, some good news for Europe's largest economy while other data showed France's trade deficit narrowed in the same period.
All eyes will now be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for March due later in the day, which is expected to show a recovery from February's 17-month low.
""It is the most important day when we speak of the economic data when investors get to see the health of the U.S. labor market. This particular number has the capacity to set the trading tone for the rest of the month,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London, wrote in a note.
Earlier in the week upbeat factory data from China and Europe led equities to rally, somewhat mollifying investor concerns over global growth that have dominated world markets since late-last year.
Hopes that the U.S.-China talks would yield a trade truce have been a major driver for European stocks this week with auto stocks leading the rally.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a deal with China could be announced within four weeks.
""It is becoming increasingly more concrete and clear that both sides want to secure a deal, hence the optimism is advancing that the outcome of a signed trade deal is moving toward a matter of 'when' and not 'if',"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM.
More complications arose for a possible merger of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for the deal, a source told Reuters.
The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe's third-largest bank out of Germany's top two lenders, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis.
Commerzbank shares rose nearly 2 percent while those of Deutsche bank dipped.
 Hammerson  Plc (LON:HMSO) slipped and weighed down the midcap FTSE 250 after Stifel downgraded shares of the British shopping center operator and Jefferies trimmed its price target.
Zurich Insurance Group AG shares came under pressure as it traded ex-dividend.
Swiss producer and supplier of polymers and chemicals Ems Chemie climbed 4 percent after it beat a first-quarter net sales target.
SES shares jumped after the company's successful launch of medium earth orbit satellites.
 Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) owner GVC Holdings Plc shares rose after the company posted 8 percent growth in quarterly net gaming revenue.
British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, but said she still hopes to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections.

Britain is now due to leave the EU in a week, but May has been forced to seek more time after Britain's divided parliament failed to approve a withdrawal agreement.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>",Biotech crops still a sticking point in U.S.-China trade deal: sources,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's lengthy approval process for genetically modified crops remains a sticking point in talks to end the trade war between China and the United States, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks.
Beijing has taken years to approve new strains of GM crops, which U.S. companies and farmers have complained stalls trade by restricting the sales of new products from companies such as DowDuPont Inc,  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), and  Syngenta  AG (OTC:SYENF). 
The issue is one of a host of U.S. complaints that the administration of President Donald Trump is demanding China address if it wants to end trade disputes that have cost both countries billions of dollars and slowed the global economy.
Trump on Thursday said the two sides were getting very close to a deal that could be announced in about four weeks, though there were still differences to be bridged.
GM crops and the approval process are still a ""big issue"" in the discussions, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, the bulk of which are genetically modified. If it does not approve new strains, then farmers in the United States cannot plant them because China may reject shipments that include them.
Seed companies cannot fully commercialize sales of new strains without those approvals. The two sides had appeared to make some progress on the issue in January, when China approved a handful of GMO crops for import. They were the first in about 18 months. The move did not address the core U.S. concerns over delays to the process.
A spokeswoman from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, who is leading the Washington team in the discussions, did not respond immediately to request for confirmation or comment.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions on Friday, which was a public holiday in China.
It is unclear what differences on the issue remain. The United States wants China to accelerate its approval process and make it more similar to Washington's.
Beijing allows imports of GMO soybeans and corn for use in animal feed, even though it does not permit planting of them.
China bought about 60 percent of U.S. soy exports, worth about $12 billion, before the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and could reject shipments of unapproved varieties.
Beijing promised to speed up its review of applications during previous trade talks with the United States in 2017. In the past, Beijing has held back approvals of imported GMO products amid concerns about anti-GMO sentiment in China.
The trade deal, should it be agreed, is expected to include a six-year time frame for purchases of more than $1 trillion in U.S. goods, including commodity products.

(Reuters) - Indian equities attracted the biggest foreign money in seven years in March and grabbed a major chunk of inflows into Asia on optimism about the upcoming general election, while most others in the region had a lackluster show due to lingering global slowdown worries and weaker exports.
Overseas investors bought $4.96 billion worth of Asian shares in March, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesian and Vietnam showed.
Indian stock markets received $4.89 billion, the biggest since February 2012, on expectations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come back to power in the over-a-month-long polls that commence next week.
On the back of solid flows, the BSE and NSE indexes gained about 7.7 percent last month, the highest among emerging markets.
""Most recent opinion polls have swayed in favor of the ruling coalition compared to three months ago, which had predicted a tighter contest,"" ANZ said in a report.
""This has helped revive sentiment towards Indian asset prices as a close contest is not considered the best outcome by markets.""
South Korean markets witnessed inflows of $262 million, while Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Philippines all had received about $100 million or less.
However, foreigners sold $512 million worth of Thai equities due to political uncertainty after a general election.
Delays in final results from Thailand's first polls in five years have added to uncertainties facing the slowing economy, raising the risk of political gridlock that could disrupt government spending and keep foreign investors away.
Overall, foreigners purchased $15.87 billion worth of stocks in the seven markets in the first quarter, the biggest in two years, data showed.
However, some analysts said fund flows would be difficult to sustain as the regional economy is pressured due to slowing global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.
Factory activity in China slightly recovered in March, but activity in Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines grew only at a modest pace. South Korea's factory activity contracted for a fifth straight month in March.
""Market participants are likely to shift their attention to slowing economic growth now that the U.S. yield curve has inverted – a development that is stoking recession fears,"" said Joanne Goh, equity strategist at DBS Bank. 
She said political and economic stress in some of the emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Brazil could flow through into Asia and affect asset prices.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lessors to India's Jet Airways Ltd are planning to ask the country's aviation regulator to de-register many more planes leased to the airline, three sources told Reuters, signaling that a planned bailout of the troubled carrier is failing to assuage their concerns.
About six of Jet's lessors are likely to apply to India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to de-register up to 15 of the grounded planes, over the next 10 days, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the situation.
Once a plane is de-registered, the lessors are free to take them out of the country and lease them to other airlines.
While some lessors have already taken a few planes out of India after a mutual agreement with Jet, sources have told Reuters, the latest series of applications to the DGCA would be on a non-consensual basis.
Jet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jet, India's oldest private carrier now controlled by its lenders, has had to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, many due to non-payment to lessors, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations.
Avolon, one of the world's biggest aircraft lessors, on Thursday applied to the DGCA to take two of its planes placed with Jet outside of India, making it the first to pull planes out on a non-consensual basis.
About 100 of Jet's 119 mainly Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co planes are leased by companies such as Avolon, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) and Aercap Holdings. It was not immediately clear which of the lessors were planning to apply for de-registration in the coming days.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Swedbank chairman quits over money laundering scandal,"By Johannes Hellstrom and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedbank Chairman Lars Idermark has quit only a week after the lender's chief executive was ousted over her handling of a money laundering scandal, saying the controversy threatened to distract from his role as head of forestry group Sodra.
The bank, Sweden's biggest mortgage lender, had fired its CEO Birgitte Bonnesen last week only an hour before a heated annual shareholder meeting marked by disgruntled investors rounding on her handling of the money laundering allegations.
Allegations against Swedbank, largely reported by Swedish TV, have linked it to a scandal at Danske Bank, which faces potential lawsuits, fines and sanctions after admitting last year that 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious payments had flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
""Following recent strong debate about Swedbank and questions about the bank’s control of suspicious money laundering in the Baltics, I have concluded that the media attention is not compatible with my CEO role at Sodra,"" Idermark said in a statement on Friday. 
""Therefore, I have decided that the best alternative is to leave the position as chair of Swedbank with immediate effect.""
In connection with last week's meeting, where many investors were vocal in their criticism of the bank's management, third-largest shareholder Alecta had warned it could demand further dismissals if the board did not take immediate action to restore confidence in the bank.
""It's a welcomed and expected decision, but it's shouldn't have taken so long; it would have been better if he resigned before the AGM,"" Swedish Shareholders' Association chief Joacim Olsson told Reuters.
Olsson called on the bank to put all cards on the table, including internal investigations into its dealings in the Baltics.
Alecta on Friday said that the Swedbank nomination committee should continue to strengthen the board. 
""They need to be thorough, but it shouldn't take too long,"" an Alecta spokesman said. 
Both Bonnesen and Idermark had been under fire for the bank's communications and how they have handled the allegations, which have sparked a four-way investigation by regulatory authorities in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Swedbank shares, meanwhile, have lost about a third of their value.
The shares were unchanged at 146.50 Swedish crowns by 0805 GMT on Friday, having recovered from a seven-year low of 127.2 crowns set on March 29 when the departure of its CEO was announced.
The committee in charge of the bank's executive appointments said it would intensify work on strengthening the board, including finding a new chairman. The board said it would call a special shareholder meeting to confirm any appointment.

1427,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>","StockBeat - Europe at Eight-Month Highs as Brexit, Trade Clouds Lift","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are on course to end the week at their highest levels in eight months, supported by the still-elusive prospect of a trade deal between China and the U.S., and by confidence that a disruptive Brexit can still be avoided.
But trading is thin and there are few big moves to report, with most participants content to sit and wait for the U.S. employment report at 08.30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
After the first hour of trading in Europe, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.1% at 388.26, while the FTSE 100 was up 0.2% and Germany’s Dax was effectively unchanged.
The Dax had traded over 12,000 for the first time since October on Thursday, pulled upwards by hopes that the two big external risks to its export-sensitive economy would soon clear. However, better-than-expected industrial production data for February, published earlier Friday, have been unable to push it any higher.
The 0.8% rise in monthly output was overwhelmingly due to construction, which offers some evidence for the argument that domestic demand is strong enough to ride out the current rough patch for the export sector. However, the German economy has rarely been able to grow strongly in the past without a big contribution from its manufacturers, and their output slid another 0.2% last month.
“German data continues to puzzle,” Oxford Economics analyst Oliver Rakau said via Twitter. “Yesterday, horrendous factory orders indicated that tumbling external demand could push industry into recession. But today’s industrial production numbers support our view that the economy is in for a very solid Q1.”



In London, stocks continue to be in a holding pattern after Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for a further short extension of the deadline for the U.K. to leave the European Union to June 30, while she and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn continue talks on finding a cross-party alternative to her three-times defeated Withdrawal Agreement.
It's not clear whether the EU will accept the latest proposal, given that it has insisted that the U.K. take part in European parliamentary elections in May if it is still a member of the union. May said the country would prepare to take part in the elections, while reserving the right to cancel them if parliament can approve an alternative course in the meantime."

1429,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 01:50AM ET</span>",Rate Cut Dismantles Last of India Ex-Central Bank Chief's Legacy,"(Bloomberg) -- The Reserve Bank of India’s interest rate cut on Thursday wasn’t only a reversal of hikes under its previous Governor Urjit Patel. It also marked the unwinding of almost all of what he had put in place during his 27-month stint.
In the four months since Patel quit abruptly in December, his policies from interest rate hikes to rules on loan defaults have been overturned.
New Governor Shaktikanta Das delivered a second consecutive rate cut in the same week that a top court in India struck down tough bankruptcy rules adopted under Patel. Under that RBI directive issued on Feb. 12, 2018, the central bank mandated a timeline for recasting bad loans or moving them to bankruptcy court, a move challenged by power generation companies, shipyards and sugar mills.
Patel, who wanted to clean up a banking system saddled with the worst non-performing loan ratios among the world’s major economies, had repeatedly clashed with the government about relaxing lending rules for some weak state-run banks. Das, a former bureaucrat who was named central bank chief a day after Patel quit, eased those curbs in recent months to support credit and economic growth.
Das has taken a more conciliatory approach to policy making than his predecessor, meeting with bankers to hear their concerns about liquidity constraints in the economy, and pledging to consult with all stakeholders, including the government.
“Unsurprisingly, the RBI has stepped up its efforts to stimulate the credit growth of public sector banks under Governor Das, an ex-civil servant,” said Priyanka Kishore, head of India and Southeast Asia economics at Oxford Economics Ltd. in Singapore. “Pushing back full resolution of stressed bank balance sheets is only likely to prolong India’s investment malaise.”
Das has also allowed lenders to restructure loans to small and medium-sized businesses that are in default and appointed a panel to consider a government request to transfer more of the central bank’s excess capital to the state. That would help the government plug a widening budget deficit, allowing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fund programs aimed at rural workers, a key voting bloc."
1430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 05, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>",A Bad Bank's Surprise Success Sparks Scramble for Juicy Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors who were bold or lucky enough to buy a little-known, opaque and illiquid vestige of one of Europe’s most dramatic bank failures may make a killing.
Their good fortune is another odd twist in the wild history of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, the Austrian lender that nearly collapsed under bad loans piled up in a state-sponsored buying spree in the former Yugoslavia. While the bank’s rescue, breakup and liquidation cost German and Austrian taxpayers billions of euros, ended political careers and put bankers in jail, its newfound success in offloading assets is reaping rich returns for investors.
Distressed debt specialists, looking at robust gains in the last year in an instrument -- a kind of warrant -- linked to the ability of Hypo Alpe and its bad-bank successor Heta Asset Resolution AG to dispose of assets, are hankering for more of it. Returns are poised to extend gains, according to six people involved in such trades who asked not to be identified because the deals are private.
“I bought them in March and then some in June at very low levels,” Najib Nakad, a portfolio manager at wealth manager Hof Hoorneman Bankiers NV in the picturesque Dutch town of Gouda, said of his purchases in 2018. “My only regret is that I didn’t find enough.”
The Esoteric CAPP
The story of this instrument goes back to Hypo Alpe’s 2016 debt restructuring. Under the deal, Austria and the Carinthia province, Hypo Alpe’s original owner, bought 11 billion euros ($12.4 billion) of debt from senior creditors at 90 percent of face value.
The bondholders were also awarded rights to a warrant, a so-called Contingent Additional Purchase Price, or CAPP, which would come into play once the bad bank’s asset sales raised enough to reimburse the Austrian government and covered the bank’s wind-down expenses.
With CAPP, any money left over would go to the former senior creditors, which have included Pacific Investment Management Co.,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), Bybrook Capital LLP, Dexia Kommunalbank Deutschland GmbH, Cyrus Capital Partners and Knighthead Capital Management.
Few expected the CAPP to be worth anything at the time of the deal. The track record of Hypo Alpe and its bad-bank successor Heta Asset Resolution AG in selling assets -- everything from seized 5-series BMWs to the run-down Sarajevo Holiday Inn -- made it seem unlikely it could ever generate the required 79 cents for every euro of debt for the CAPP to kick in. After all, Austrian regulator FMA had predicted as little as 46 cents in 2016.
Yet over the course of 2017, hedge funds and bankers who had followed the story for years noticed that the economic recovery in Croatia eased the sale of Heta’s bad debt and seized assets. They started to put feelers out to senior bondholders.
Seeking Sellers
“Once things started to improve, and started to become more clear, I reached out to a broker to see if there was anyone willing to sell,” said Nakad.
A broker at a major investment bank who started to propose transactions in late 2017 said one of the first movers paid about 260,000 euros for CAPPs linked to around 100 million euros of face value of debt. As the deals remained few and far between, prices advanced to 1 percent -- or 1 million euros for 100 million euros of nominal value -- around April 2018, when Heta itself first indicated that the CAPPs could be in the money.
The first-moving buyer passed the CAPPs on for a little less than 2 million euros a few months later -- nearly eight times his initial investment, according to the broker. But that stunning return -- although a small absolute amount, to be sure -- is far from the end of the story. Some brokers say the payout may eventually hit 10 percent, or around 1.2 billion euros, the level at which it’s capped.
So far, the CAPPs are on track to pay at least 6.5 percent of the nominal, based on a calculation by the FMA, the Austrian regulator overseeing Heta’s wind-down. Heta itself said in December that it will reach at least 6.9 percent.
The people following the market say they saw CAPPs change hands at more than 7 percent earlier this year and they are currently being bid for at 7.1 percent to 7.25 percent.
Timing Question
The biggest uncertainty at this point is the timing of the actual payout, because that won’t happen before Heta and all its units are fully liquidated. The process of liquidation may start 2023 and still take several years after that.
Cutting short the uncertainty is one of the reasons why any creditor is selling the CAPPs at all.
Meanwhile, the hedge funds’ profits could reignite a postmortem political debate of the Heta wind-down in Austria. The CAPP effectively distributes to bondholders the contribution to the debt deal by Carinthia -- a de facto penalty for the excessive use of guarantees by which the region’s late nationalist leader Joerg Haider allowed Hypo Alpe’s breakneck expansion. Haider’s former Freedom Party has attacked that distribution as an unnecessary giveaway.
For now, though, investors are looking to ride the wave.
The risk-reward “is extremely attractive in bad-bank residuals as we have seen in the past decade,” said Nakad."

Boeing's top-selling aircraft has been grounded worldwide since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines disaster, which killed 157 people, and came just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189.
The grounding of the model has had a limited impact on the fares and performances of airlines in most markets due to seasonally low demand in the first quarter, Fitch said in its report.
It added that there is limited flexibility for airlines to switch to alternatives from Airbus or Boeing.
The Indian aviation market, however, has seen a sharp rise in air fares in the recent months due to tight supply, partly worsened by the suspension of the 737 MAX, Fitch said.

A preliminary report in the Ethiopian crash on Thursday showed that the doomed 737 MAX jet hit excessive speed and was forced downwards by a wrongly-triggered automation system as pilots wrestled to regain control.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics sees lowest quarterly profit in more than two years,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd said on Friday it was heading for its lowest quarterly profit in more than two years as a glut in memory chips, slowing panel sales and rising competition in smartphones hit margins.
The South Korean tech giant said first-quarter operating profit likely slid 60 percent from a year earlier, missing market expectations and putting it on track for its weakest quarterly profit since late 2016.
Shares in Samsung rose briefly before paring gains to trade flat following the guidance, as many investors are already looking ahead to an earnings recovery on the back an improvement in chip prices in the second half of the year.
Samsung supplies memory chips and screens for its own smartphones and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and server chips for cloud companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Its semiconductor business is the main profit driver. 
""In the second half, memory chip prices will have a soft landing, so falls will slow, and the release of new iPhones later seems like a good sign for Samsung's display and memory chips,"" said Kim Yang-jae, an analyst at KTB Investment and Securities.
The world's biggest maker of smartphones and memory chips said in a filing January-March profit was likely 6.2 trillion won ($5.5 billion), missing the 6.8 trillion won estimate from analysts according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Revenue likely fell 14 percent from a year earlier to 52 trillion won. The firm will disclose detailed earnings in late April.
Samsung shares were flat as of 0120 GMT, while the broader market up 0.2 percent.
The firm earlier had warned the quarter could be disappointing due to falls in memory prices, and slowing demand for display panels used in Apple's iPhones.
Samsung's premium Galaxy smartphones meanwhile are struggling to be profitable due to rising costs of innovation, competition from Chinese rivals and the reluctance of consumers to upgrade, analysts have said.
HIT BOTTOM
Samsung's share price has leapt more than 25 percent since sinking to a two-year low in early January as some investors bet on a recovery in chip demand.
SK Hynix Inc, Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung - which dominate the global market for dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers, smartphones and servers - recently have issued upbeat assessments of the prospects for a recovery in chip prices.
Hopes were buoyed further when data showed the manufacturing sector in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March.
Samsung is betting a new line-up of smartphones including a foldable handset and a 5G-enabled model will help boost its market share in China, which crashed with the advent of cheaper Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
But its latest phones are expensive to make, weighing on profitability even as its sells faster than its predecessor, analysts say.

""New smartphones coming out in the second half won't necessarily help its smartphone business, but will be a plus for Samsung's chip side as those phones require high density chip adoptions,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at BNK Securities.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",Jeff Bezos keeps Amazon voting power in divorce settlement,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will retain voting control of his entire $143 billion stake in the company under a divorce settlement with his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, who will own 25 percent of those shares, the couple said on Thursday, removing uncertainty over control of the online retailer.
The world's richest couple had announced their impending divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January, causing some to worry that Jeff Bezos could wind up with less Amazon voting power or that he or MacKenzie would liquidate large positions.
(Graphic: Amazon filing with U.S. SEC - https:// “It takes the issue off the table, with less turbulence than you might have expected,” said an investor, whose company owns several million dollars worth of Amazon shares but who asked for anonymity because of a firm policy.  MacKenzie Bezos will wind up with a stake in Amazon that is worth roughly $36 billion. Her shares represent a 4 percent stake in Amazon, according to a regulatory filing by the company. The Amazon shares will make her the world's third-richest woman while Jeff Bezos will remain the world's richest person, according to Forbes. The couple, who tweeted separately on Thursday, disclosed that under their settlement MacKenzie will give up her interests in the Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos bought in 2013 and which has been a frequent target of criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, and the rocket company Blue Origin he founded in 2000.  ""Grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff,"" MacKenzie Bezos said in her tweet outlining the agreement, the first and only post from an account created this month. The two did not provide any further financial details about the settlement. ""INFLUENCE WOULD BE THE SAME"" Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, said in the filing that 4 percent of its outstanding shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos' name after court approval of the divorce, which is expected to occur in about 90 days. The petition for divorce was filed in Washington state, a person familiar with the matter said. Jeff Bezos, whom Amazon listed in its most recent proxy statement as its single largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake, will keep sole voting authority over the shares unless MacKenzie donates them to a nonprofit or sells them in the open market. Amazon shares closed down 0.1 percent at $1,818.86.  Jeff Bezos, 55, is seen as essential to Amazon's meteoric growth and stock price rise since he founded the company as an online bookseller in 1994. He has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon. ""When I think about Amazon, and the influence Bezos has on Amazon, I would argue his influence would be the same if he had 51 percent shares outstanding or 1 percent. I think his influence is dictated by his vision for Amazon,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said. MacKenzie Bezos' stake in Amazon is worth more than the market values of nearly 70 percent of the components of the S&P 500. The settlement suggests that Amazon will be spared the kind of boardroom battle that has plagued other companies whose owners are dealing with family rifts, even though the divorce had jolted the once-private Bezos couple into the public spotlight. Jeff Bezos re-tweeted MacKenzie's statement and added in a separate post that he was grateful ""for her support and for her kindness in this process."" Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, said the settlement should put investors at ease. “They’ve done a lot of work behind the scenes to make their breakup as amicable as it seems,” she said. Still, Sadler added, ""Without knowing what cash she received, I have no idea how favorable it was to him or not."" The day the couple announced their separation on Twitter, the National Enquirer promised to reveal an affair by Jeff Bezos that it claimed had ended their marriage, contrary to the couple's statement that they were on a ""long period of loving exploration and trial separation."" 
The U.S. tabloid then published alleged photos and intimate text messages between Bezos and his new partner, former television news anchor Lauren Sanchez.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes a bill exposing OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits, three sources familiar with Saudi energy policy said.
They said the option had been discussed internally by senior Saudi energy officials in recent months. Two of the sources said the plan had been discussed with OPEC members and one source briefed on Saudi oil policy said Riyadh had also communicated the threat to senior U.S. energy officials.
The chances of the U.S. bill known as NOPEC coming into force are slim and Saudi Arabia would be unlikely to follow through, but the fact Riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom's annoyance about potential U.S. legal challenges to OPEC.
In the unlikely event Riyadh were to ditch the dollar, it would undermine the its status as the world's main reserve currency, reduce Washington's clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation states.
""The Saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said.
""The Saudis say: let the Americans pass NOPEC and it would be the U.S. economy that would fall apart,"" another source said.
Saudi Arabia's energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A U.S. state department official said: ""as a general matter, we don't comment on pending legislation."" 
The U.S. Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said that NOPEC could lead to unintended consequences.
DOLLAR HEGEMONY
NOPEC, or the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, was first introduced in 2000 and aims to remove sovereign immunity from U.S. antitrust law, paving the way for OPEC states to be sued for curbing output in a bid to raise oil prices.
While the bill has never made it into law despite numerous attempts, the legislation has gained momentum since U.S. President Donald Trump came to office. Trump said he backed NOPEC in a book published in 2011 before he was elected, though he not has not voiced support for NOPEC as president.
Trump has instead stressed the importance of U.S-Saudi relations, including sales of U.S. military equipment, even after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.
A move by Saudi Arabia to ditch the dollar would resonate well with big non-OPEC oil producers such as Russia as well as major consumers China and the European Union, which have been calling for moves to diversify global trade away from the dollar to dilute U.S. influence over the world economy.
Russia, which is subject to U.S. sanctions, has tried to sell oil in euros and China's yuan but the proportion of its sales in those currencies is not significant.
Venezuela and Iran, which are also under U.S. sanctions, sell most of their oil in other currencies but they have done little to challenge the dollar's hegemony in the oil market.
However, if a long-standing U.S. ally such as Saudi Arabia joined the club of non-dollar oil sellers it would be a far more significant move likely to gain traction within the industry.
WHAT IF?
Saudi Arabia controls a 10th of global oil production, roughly on par with its main rivals - the United States and Russia. Its oil firm Saudi Aramco holds the crown of the world's biggest oil exporter with sales of $356 billion last year. 
Depending on prices, oil is estimated to represent 2 percent to 3 percent of global gross domestic product. At the current price of $70 per barrel, the annual value of global oil output is $2.5 trillion. 
Not all of those oil volumes are traded in the U.S. currency but at least 60 percent is traded via tankers and international pipelines with the majority of those deals done in dollars.
Trading in derivatives such as oil futures and options is mainly dollar denominated. The top two global energy exchanges, ICE (NYSE:ICE) and CME, traded a billion lots of oil derivatives in 2018 with a nominal value of about $5 trillion.
Just the prospect of NOPEC has already had implications for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Qatar, one of the core Gulf OPEC members, quit the group in December because of the risk NOPEC could harm its U.S. expansion plans.
Two sources said that despite raising the dollar threat, Saudi Arabia did not believe it would need to follow through.
""I don't think the NOPEC bill will pass but the Saudis have 'what if' scenarios,"" one of the sources said.
ASSET SALES
In the event of such a drastic Saudi move, the impact would take some time to play out given the industry's decades-old practices built around the U.S. dollar - from lending to exchange clearing.
Other potential threats raised in Saudi discussions about retaliation against NOPEC included liquidating the kingdom's holdings in the United States, the sources said.
The kingdom has nearly $1 trillion invested in the United States and holds some $160 billion in U.S. Treasuries.
If it did carry out its threat, Riyadh would also have to ditch the Saudi riyal's peg to the dollar, which has been exchanged at a fixed rate since 1986, the sources said.
The United States, the world's largest oil consumer, relied heavily on Saudi and OPEC supplies for decades - while supporting Riyadh militarily against its arch-foe Iran.
But soaring shale oil production at home has made Washington less dependant on OPEC, allowing it to be more forceful in the way it deals with Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern nations.

Over the past year, Trump has regularly called on OPEC to pump more oil to lower global oil prices, and linked his demands to political support for Riyadh - something previous U.S. administrations have refrained from doing, at least publicly.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 07:51PM ET</span>","Elon Musk safe for now as U.S. judge urges Tesla CEO, SEC to end tweet dispute","By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk's job as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's chief executive appeared safe on Thursday as a federal judge in Manhattan urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter.
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan gave both sides two weeks to work out their differences, and said she could rule on whether Musk violated his recent fraud settlement with the regulator if they failed.
""Take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out,"" the judge said.
The hearing appeared to lift an overhang over Tesla, as the SEC stopped well short of recommending Musk's removal as chief executive or even from the electric car company's board.
Instead, the regulator suggested that greater oversight of Musk's communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides, was punishment enough, at least for now.
""What this is to the SEC is strike two, and if there is another transgression they might seek a director and officer bar,"" said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a former SEC lawyer. ""They are just trying to send a message: be more careful.""
Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet, where the SEC said he improperly posted material information about Tesla's vehicle production outlook without first seeking approval from its lawyers.
The SEC said pre-approval was a core element of the October 2018 settlement, which resolved a lawsuit over a tweet last Aug. 7 where Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
That settlement called for Musk to step down as Tesla's chairman, and levied $20 million civil fines each on Musk and the Palo Alto, California-based company.
Musk declined to discuss the hearing as he left the courthouse, surrounded by a horde of reporters, photographers and television cameras, but said ""I feel very loved here.""
In a statement provided later by Tesla, Musk said: ""I have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I’m pleased with her decision today. The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.""
TESLA ALSO FAULTED
Tesla's share price tumbled 8.2% on Thursday, after the company on Wednesday night reported lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries, but recouped some early losses once Musk's job no longer appeared imperiled.
The company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.
""Elon Musk was very well composed in the court today, which means he's taking it seriously,"" Craig Irwin, a Roth Capital Partners analyst who attended the hearing, said in an interview. He called Nathan's order ""a good outcome for Tesla investors."" Irwin rates Tesla ""neutral.""
The battle concerned a tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" meaning 500,000 vehicles.
Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be ""probably around"" 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000. 
The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.
Musk's lawyers countered that the earlier tweet contained nothing new, and that the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla.
RESPECT FOR JUSTICE SYSTEM
At the hearing, SEC lawyer Cheryl Crumpton said a contempt finding could require Musk to file regular reports about how Tesla lawyers are overseeing his tweets. 
Noting that Musk had called his $20 million fine ""worth it,"" Crumpton said the threat of higher potential fines might also be needed to show that further violations would be ""not worth it.""
Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Crumpton also faulted what she called Tesla's ""troubling"" conduct. ""Tesla still appears to be unwilling to exercise any meaningful control over the conduct of its CEO,"" she said.
Tesla was not accused of contempt.
Musk's lawyer, John Hueston, countered that the ""ambiguity"" of the settlement made ""the hard penalty of contempt"" unfair.
The ""funding secured"" tweet had sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent. Musk's privatization plan was at best in an early stage, however, and financing was not in place.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said he does not favor draconian penalties that could harm investors, saying when Musk settled that ""the skills and support of certain individuals may be important to the future success of a company.""
Musk remains an outspoken critic of the SEC.
Since the case began, he has dubbed the regulator the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission,"" recalling his attacks on investors who sell Tesla stock short.
And in the early morning of Feb. 26, after the SEC filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight.""
As he prepared to enter the courthouse, Musk told reporters: ""I have a great respect for the justice system.""

Asked whether he also respected the SEC, Musk laughed, before turning to go inside.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:58PM ET</span>",U.S. test nuclear reactor may run 40 percent over cost: government document,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The flagship of the Trump administration's advanced nuclear power research program could cost about 40 percent more than a government official estimated earlier this year, a U.S. Department of Energy document shows.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry has tried to breathe life into the country's nuclear power industry, which is suffering in the face of competition from plants burning cheap natural gas as well as falling costs for wind and solar power.
Perry announced the versatile test reactor, or VTR, in late February, saying it was a ""key step to implementing President (Donald) Trump's direction to revitalize and expand the U.S. nuclear industry,"" and critical for national security. 
The VTR would let U.S. companies conduct advanced technology and fuels tests without having to go to competitors in Russia and China, Perry said. Meant to be built by late 2025, it would be the first new nuclear test reactor built by the Energy Department, or DOE, in many decades.
Perry did not put a price on the reactor, which would be led by the department's Idaho National Laboratory. But an internal DOE document dated Jan. 22, obtained by public policy group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) through a freedom of information request, puts the estimated cost for construction and starting the VTR at $3.9 billion to $6 billion. The document, seen by Reuters on Thursday, had not been reported previously.
The high end of that range is about 40 percent more than an estimate by Kemal Pasamehmetoglu, the head of the Idaho National Laboratory's VTR program, who was quoted in the Morning Consult news outlet in February saying it would cost up to $3.5 billion in today's dollars. The calculation of the jump in the cost is affected by the Energy Department's estimate which included cost escalations of up to 3.8 percent annually. 
The UCS estimated that VTR's cost for the next seven years would be about $550 million to $850 million annually, compared to the $740 million appropriated in the fiscal year 2019 budget for the department's entire advanced nuclear technology development, which contained just $65 million for VTR. 
If successful, the VTR is meant to lead to a new wave of so-called fast reactors, reviving nuclear power companies. Fast reactors breed their own fuel, unlike today's fleet of light water reactors. They also have a safety benefit of allowing a plant to operate under low pressure conditions. 
But critics worry that the fuel cycle of fast reactors will likely depend on the reprocessing or recycling of plutonium or uranium, both of which can be used as fissile materials for nuclear weapons. 
""Fast reactors are less safe, less secure, and more proliferation-prone than light-water reactors,"" said Ed Lyman, a senior scientist at UCS. ""The DOE should not be asking taxpayers to spend billions on this dangerous reactor."" 
Lyman also said cheaper approaches for testing to support fast reactor development could be done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the DOE-sponsored research and development center in Tennessee.
The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

VTR has already led to business for nuclear companies. In November, the Idaho lab said it had contracted GE Hitachi Nuclear, a venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and Hitachi Ltd, to support the conceptual design and safety activities for an unspecified amount.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:46PM ET</span>",Ethiopia inquiry shows Boeing MAX hurtling uncontrolled to disaster,"By Jason Neely
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian Airlines' doomed 737 MAX jet hit excessive speed and was forced downwards by a wrongly-triggered automation system as pilots wrestled to regain control, a preliminary report into the crash that has shaken the aviation world showed on Thursday.
Three times the captain, Yared Getachew, cried ""pull up"", before the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co plane plunged into a field six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew, said the report by Ethiopian investigators. 
The March 10 disaster, and parallels with another 737 MAX crash in Indonesia last October in which 189 people died, has led to the worldwide grounding of Boeing's flagship model. 
It has also brought uncomfortable scrutiny over new software, pilot training and regulatory rigor. 
The report leaves unanswered questions, aviation experts said, over whether crew followed guidance not to restore power to a troublesome anti-stall system following sensor damage, possibly caused by a bird strike. The plane was also left at unusually high thrust throughout the flight, data suggested.
While the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority's Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau had a remit to investigate rather than blame, it implicitly pointed the finger at Boeing by defending the pilots, recommending the U.S. company fix its control systems, and saying regulators must be certain before allowing the MAX back in the air.
""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft,"" Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference.
""Since repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed ... it is recommended that the aircraft control system shall be reviewed by the manufacturer.""
Boeing, the world's biggest planemaker and one of the United States' most important exporters with a $500 billion order book for the MAX, says a new software fix for its MCAS anti-stall system will enable pilots to always override if necessary. 
Responding to the preliminary report, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment.""
""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it,"" Muilenburg said in a statement.
FRAGMENTS IN A CRATER
According to the preliminary report, an alarm indicating excess speed was heard on the cockpit voice reporter as the jet reached 500 knots (575 miles per hour) - well above operational limits.
The plane had faulty ""angle of attack"" sensor readings, its nose was pushed down automatically, and the crew lost control despite following recommended instructions, it said. 
""Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground,"" the report said, indicating the strength of the impact on an arid field in an agricultural zone. No bodies were recovered, only charred fragments among the debris in a crater.
A final report by Ethiopian authorities aided by air-safety experts from the United States and Europe is due to be published within a year.
Boeing has seen billions wiped off its market value since the crash, but its shares rose 2.9 percent on Thursday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the report of flight control problems, which Boeing was already trying to fix, meant a ""worst case scenario"" of a new cause was probably off the table. 
The software update ""along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents, will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS-related accident from ever happening again,"" Muilenburg's statement said.
Families of the victims, regulators and travellers around the world have been waiting to find out to what extent Boeing technology or the pilots' actions played a role.
The preliminary report into the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia suggested pilots also lost control after grappling with the MCAS software, a new automated anti-stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose based on faulty sensor data.
""Whatever the issues were, they better be 110 percent sure about their resolution, otherwise the 157 lives lost would have been for nothing if something like this happens again,"" said one woman, who lost her father in the Ethiopian crash, asking not to be identified. ""This is a lesson to not take shortcuts in order to try and save bucks.""
'PROFITS OVER SAFETY'?
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulator, under fire for its certification of the MAX, cautioned the inquiry was not over. ""As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,"" it said.
Boeing may press to know more about how crew members responded to problems triggered by the faulty data. The New York Times quoted the Ethiopian government's Dagmawit as saying pilots turned MCAS off and on, which is not the step recommended in procedures telling crew to leave it off once disabled. 
With bereaved families angry and confused, relatives of an American woman killed in the Ethiopian crash, Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a U.S. victim in Chicago. The complaint named Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, the manufacturer of the angle of attack sensor, as defendants.
Stumo is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader, who called for a boycott of the 737 MAX on Thursday.
Pilots around the world were watching closely.
""If the preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities is accurate, the pilots quickly identified the malfunction and applied the manufacturer's checklist,"" said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots. 
""Following this checklist did not appear to allow the pilots to regain control of the aircraft.""
But a former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigator questioned the aircraft's speed, which according to data in the report was left on a higher than usual setting. Aviation experts say the sensor fault should have required the crew to take manual control of the power since it would disrupt accurate speed readings in the cockpit.
""The report does not address information about unreliable airspeed procedures which should be considered,"" said Greg Feith, a former NTSB air safety investigator.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",Motel 6 pays $12 million for sharing guest lists with U.S. immigration: Washington AG,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Motel 6 agreed to pay $12 million to settle a lawsuit in which Washington state's attorney general said the chain routinely provided guest lists to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents.
Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who announced the settlement on Thursday, said the money will go to roughly 80,000 people who stayed at seven of the chain's Washington locations from 2015 and 2017.
He said their privacy rights were violated because Motel 6 gave their personal information to ICE without their knowledge, and at least nine Washington residents were detained.
As part of the settlement, Motel 6 also agreed it will not hand over guest information nationwide absent a warrant or other legal order, and will improve employee training, Ferguson said.
Motel 6 said in a statement it was pleased to settle, and that ""the safety and security of our guests, which includes protecting guest information, is our top priority.""
The settlement came five months after Motel 6 agreed to a $7.6 million settlement of similar claims in a proposed class-action lawsuit in Arizona. That accord has yet to receive court approval, court records show.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration a central focus of his presidency.

Motel 6 is controlled by the private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, which bought the brand in 2012.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Women running the money? Rarely at hedge funds,"By Maiya Keidan and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Generous salary and juicy bonus? Check. Client meetings at private members' club? Check. Swanky Mayfair office? Check. Company maternity scheme? Maybe, we’ll get back to you.
In the competition for talent, the hedge fund industry still has an edge over many other areas of finance, except, it would seem, when it comes to employing women.
Women are in the minority across the financial industry when it comes to top jobs. A Reuters analysis of regulatory filings shows the proportion is especially low among British hedge funds, most of which are private and not bound by disclosure rules.
Just seven women were hired or promoted last year as investment executives at 20 of Britain’s top private hedge funds, the lowest level in at least a decade, the analysis found. They took on 82 men in that period.
Of all the places to work in hedge funds, the investment team is the most coveted. Portfolio managers or traders decide where to invest client money and are traditionally the highest-paid members of staff. Such roles are a launch pad for star managers to set up their own firms in the future, establishing the next generation of hedge funds.
In Britain, these roles are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under a category known as the 'CF 30' function, which also comprises senior marketing jobs.
A Reuters analysis of CF 30 filings for 76 financial firms showed hedge funds registered women at a fraction of the rate of other finance companies. 
(For a graphic on British hedge funds lag on diversity of key staff, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2UNZpml)
For an interactive version of the graphic showing registration rates across financial firms in Britain, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2HA0lb3.
Hedge funds say they struggle to find women to work as portfolio managers and point out that women are better represented in other areas, including compliance and legal counsel. These are middle-office or back-office positions, rarely involved in investment calls.
People who work for or in financial services say more female candidates would emerge for trading positions if hedge funds cast the net wider for potential candidates, and offered better maternity packages and mentorships.
""Hedge funds will all say they don't get female applicants but are they even looking for them? Do they care? The data suggests no they don't,"" said Yasmine Chinwala of think tank New Financial.
Unlike the rest of the financial sector, where large, listed companies are now required to disclose pay gaps between men and women, and are under public pressure to have more women in senior roles, hedge funds can mostly operate below the radar.
Usually privately-owned and run by their founders, they are not the target of government drives to improve female representation in finance.
""Public scrutiny, and more specifically, mandated government-backed scrutiny … delivers results,"" said Chinwala. ""These sectors have shown they are not going to make significant changes themselves without a big, concerted, external push.""
INVESTING BY NUMBERS
Three of the 20 top British hedge funds covered in the Reuters analysis commented about their record of hiring women. 
""We have women represented across all functional areas of the firm as well as in senior management positions which are not covered by CF 30 registrations, which represents a small proportion of our staff,"" a spokeswoman for Marshall Wace said.
The firm has registered three women in the CF 30 category since 2009 compared with 40 men over the same period.
""Algebris continues to invest in women's careers, developing talent and creating the next generation of female leaders in finance,"" said a spokesman for the firm, which registered nine women and 24 men as a CF 30 since 2009.
Emso Asset Management said 35 percent of its employees were women and said it paid employees for the first 26 weeks of their 52 week maternity leave. It has registered nine women and 30 men as a CF 30 since 2009. 
""Our diversity in employee base reflects the diversity of markets within which we make investments,"" Chief Operating Officer Rory McGregor said in an emailed statement.
Emso was the only one of the 20 hedge funds to comment publicly on its maternity pay.
Paid leave after becoming a parent can vary widely between firms. One portfolio manager told Reuters she had to argue her case to get paid while on maternity leave. She declined to be named for fear of damaging her career.
Valerie Kosenko, at recruitment consultant Mondrian Alpha, said maternity pay was an important consideration for a lot of women looking to work in the hedge fund industry. 
""I don't think hedge funds gave a lot of thought to it at all. It's something that hedge funds can definitely improve."" 
The 10 largest U.S. hedge funds with a UK office - including Citadel and Millennium Management - registered slightly more women than their British counterparts, at nearly 13 percent, in 2018, according to the Reuters analysis. 
A spokesman for Millennium declined to comment. Citadel did not respond to requests for comment.
CF 30 is an imperfect measure of diversity because firms can have a different interpretation of the FCA guidelines as to who should be registered.
Some firms register investor relations staff as CF 30. Women tend to be well-represented in such jobs, meaning that the CF 30 category may exaggerate the actual number of women hired or promoted to be traders.
In the decade covered by the Reuters analysis, the ratio of women employed under the CF 30 designation by 20 of the top private British hedge funds never went above 23 percent and averaged 16 percent.
WHY TRY?
There are no comparable figures on hedge funds' portfolio manager hires in the United States, but data on U.S. firms founded in the last few years show the industry remains dominated by men. Women-led firms managed only about 3 percent of the assets in new funds launched between 2013 and 2017, according to figures from Hedge Fund Intelligence.
Jane Buchan, who spent nearly 20 years allocating money as chief executive of PAAMCO, one of the world's biggest investors in hedge funds, says female money managers have to work harder to get investors to trust them.
“Women need to outperform significantly in order to have the same asset levels as men who perform worse,"" said Buchan, who now runs her own fund, Martlet Asset Management.
""With this sort of outcome, which can be shown in academic studies and what many women perceive from their own interactions with investors, why try?""
Man Group, one of the few listed hedge funds, is the only UK hedge fund firm to sign up to the British government's Women in Finance Charter, which sets targets to increase female representation in the upper echelons of the City.
The London-headquartered firm is targeting 25 percent female representation in senior management roles by the end of 2020 from 22 percent last year and has introduced a number of measures to improve gender diversity, including a returners program for women who left the industry.
It offers 18 weeks paid leave globally for new parents, male or female.
Man Group registered five women as a CF 30 last year, but that represented a re-categorization to comply with European rules rather than new hires. 
""We have concentrated on making sure internal people can meet their potential, introduced a lot of mentoring, ensured that we always consider a female candidate and looked at things that have historically slowed down hiring women,"" said Man’s chief executive officer, Luke Ellis. 
Women held 13 percent of investment management roles at Man Group globally in 2018, up from 11 percent in 2017 and 8 percent in 2013, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
THE SLEAZY BITS
Interviews with nine women who work or worked as portfolio managers in Britain and the United States, said hedge funds could be a tough sector for female investment managers. Some of them had experienced disparaging comments about their appearance or their investment abilities. 
Male colleagues making unwelcome advances at female co-workers on nights-out was not an unusual occurrence, according to seven women who worked in a variety of different roles for hedge funds, including as traders.
One hedge fund reassigned the female toilet on the trading floor as a men's toilet, meaning women on the investment team had to walk to another part of the building, two of the women said.
None of the women, who requested anonymity to avoid damaging their careers, worked at the hedge funds named in this story.
Clare Flynn Levy, a former hedge fund portfolio manager who now runs her own behavioral analytics company, said women might put up with a toxic work culture for a while but ultimately they tended to leave. 
""In retrospect, I think I used a combination of working very hard, laughing off the sleazy bits and occasionally putting my foot down if I felt someone had crossed a line,"" she said.
Kosenko, the recruitment consultant, said she has had a hard time convincing women to join hedge funds where they might be the first female on the trading floor.
But with investors increasingly considering diversity when deciding where to put their money, some hedge funds are looking to shake up their ranks. Last year, Kosenko had five meetings with hedge fund clients about hiring women. In the first few months of this year, she has had four.

""I think in general the big trend is let's grow the talent and let's go outside of what we are used to -- white males from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),"" she said.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Options-based funds offer succor to investors wary of volatility,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's pivot on tightening U.S. monetary policy this year and a change in a bond market gauge that is often viewed as a harbinger of a recession pose a dilemma for investors: how to stay in stocks without running the risk of losing one's shirt when risk assets stumble.
Alternative mutual funds that use options to maintain exposure to stocks even as they tamp down volatility could provide the buffer between mild gains and massive losses. 
""We definitely think now is a good time to be looking at strategies that can both participate in market advances and reliably deliver protection,"" said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers in Boston.
The $8.27 billion Gateway Fund - the oldest and largest fund in Morningstar's options-based category - has a three-decade history of running low-volatility equity index options strategies.
The fund, which marries stock ownership with index call and put options hedges, aims to capture a portion of equity market returns but with less volatility.
In the fourth quarter when the S&P 500 Total Return index tanked 13.52%, the fund's Y class shares fell only 7.47%. On the flip side, when stocks rebounded 13.65% in the first quarter, the fund's shares only gained 5.01%.
Like any investment, gaining protection from volatility carries risk. Over the longterm, investors may miss out on big gains by opting for nearterm protection from huge losses.
For instance, an investment of $10,000 in the Gateway fund 10 years ago would now be worth about $17,500, according to Refinitiv data. By comparison, the same amount invested in the S&P 500 Index's tracking fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (AX:SPY), would have returned more than $44,000, albeit with a higher degree of volatility.
""Investors would be better off just putting their money in passive funds,"" said Mark Hebner, president of Irvine, California-based independent financial adviser Index Funds Advisors.
Equity markets have enjoyed a period of very low volatility and strong returns over the last decade, but that may be set to change.
Stocks tumbled hard late last year, as investors fretted over mounting concerns about global growth, waning corporate profits, U.S.-China trade tensions and the Fed's path on rate hikes.
Even though most of those losses have been recouped, jitters remain, with some worrying that the Fed's dovish tilt is an implicit confirmation of the markets’ anxiety about growth. 
The recent inversion of the yield curve -- the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond slipped below 3-month T-bill rates for the first time in more than a decade - is considered a classic signal that a recession may follow in the next one to two years.
""I think there are a lot of advisers who are looking for that downside protection, but they don't want to bet against the market and they don't want to be overallocated to bonds. Our strategy fits that need pretty well,"" Jilek said.

Notwithstanding worries about an approaching recession, quitting stocks altogether may prove expensive.
""Historically, equity markets tended to produce some of the strongest returns in the months and quarters following an inversion,"" J.P. Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note.
But it might not be all smooth sailing.
""The last three years of the '90s bull market were very profitable but very volatile,"" said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at fund manager Calamos Investments in Chicago. ""We may be looking at a period like that again."" 
Pars leads strategy for the Calamos Hedged Equity Income Fund, which uses a covered call strategy - selling call options against a portfolio of equities - while using puts to limit downside.
""It's geared toward investors that may be a little less comfortable - either because where we are in the cycle or just in general - with full-on exposure to the equity market,"" Pars said.
For 2018 fourth quarter, the fund fell 6.32%, compared with a drop of 13.52% for the S&P 500 Total Return index, according to Morningstar data. In the 2019 first quarter, the fund's shares gained 6.38%, compared with a 13.65% gain for stocks.
The fund, a relatively new spinoff from the $6 billion Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund, has gone from managing $10 million to $160 million over the last 18 months, Pars said.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",U.S. government weighs social-media snooping to detect Social Security fraud,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Getting followed on social media could soon gain a new meaning for workers applying for Social Security disability benefits. The Trump administration is working on a plan to let the Social Security Administration (SSA) check up on claimants on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter in order to root out fraud and abuse in the disability program.
It is the latest move in a push by critics of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) to crack down on alleged fraud and abuse. Conservatives have long argued that cheating is rampant in the program, and in recent years convinced Congress to fund expanded efforts by the SSA on anti-fraud efforts. 
The idea of social media surveillance is getting a push from the conservative Heritage Foundation. Such monitoring already is done in some fraud and abuse investigations. For example, in 2014, the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) utilized social media reviews to help arrest more than 100 people who defrauded SSDI out of millions of dollars. Investigators found photos on the personal accounts of disability claimants riding on jet skis, performing physical stunts in karate studios and driving motorcycles.
The SSA now is looking at expanding social media monitoring capability to front-line agency staff who work with claimants in the initial stages, before any investigations have been initiated.
The idea already is drawing fire from disability advocates. They argue that social media profiles can offer misleading evidence, since dates when photos were shot are not always clear and because not all legitimate disabilities prevent participation in activities that might seem suspicious.
“The proposal to allow disability adjudicators to monitor or review social media of disability claimants is an unjustified invasion of privacy unlikely to uncover fraud,” said Lisa Ekman, director of government affairs at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives.
The prospect of such governmental surveillance is as disturbing as it is eyebrow-raising. Consider that workers and employers split a 1.8  percent payroll tax to fund SSDI. Now, in return, the SSA may be empowered to snoop around their Facebook profiles. And it is premised on a questionable assertion - namely, that SSDI really is plagued by rampant fraud and abuse.
For starters, let me stipulate that SSDI is not a perfect program. One of the biggest problems is the staggering backlog in appeals cases, with applicants often waiting more than 600 days for decisions on claims. That problem stems from a history of unwise slashing of the SSA budget by Congress in recent years that has left the program dramatically short-staffed.
Fraud and abuse do exist in the program, and it should be weeded out to protect taxpayers and legitimate claimants. But any program this large - public or private-sector - is sure to be a target for people bent on taking advantage, and critics often argue by highlighting sensational cases. 
Mark Hinkle, acting press officer for the SSA, notes that the agency uses data analytics and predictive modeling to detect fraud, and has created new groups dedicated to detection and prevention. Asked to comment on plans for expanded use of social media to detect fraud, he confirmed that SSA investigative units already use social media, and that the agency  has “studied strategies of other agencies and private entities to determine how social media might be used to evaluate disability applications.""
He added, ""Social Security does not currently pursue social media in disability determinations, and we don't have other information to provide at this time.”
DISABILITY FRAUD IS RARE 
Program statistics do not support the allegation that SSDI is riddled with fraud and abuse.
In the government’s fiscal-year 2018, the SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported about $98 million in recoveries, fines, settlements/judgments, and restitution as a result of Social Security fraud investigations. The OIG states that most the recovered funds were from recipients of SSDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a means-tested welfare program for low-income seniors, blind and disabled people.
That sounds like big money. But in fiscal 2018, the SSA paid out $197 billion to beneficiaries of SSDI and SSI. And keep in mind that the recovered $98 million was for benefits paid out over several years, not just in 2018.
SSA data shows that the rate of overpayments for all its programs was well under 1 percent of benefit payouts in each of the last three fiscal years - and not all improper payments are fraud. More often, overpayments occur due to administrative delays at the SSA in making adjustments to benefit amounts due to errors and paperwork snafus.
A federal government list of programs at highest risk for making improper payments compiled by the Office of Management and Budget does not even mention Social Security.
Considering all that, I asked Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation who studies Social Security, to justify the foundation’s steady drumbeat of accusations that SSDI is plagued by fraud and abuse. 
She readily acknowledged that fraud rates are low. “Outright fraud is actually a pretty small component of the program’s problems,” she said. “Most people perceive fraud as a big issue but what they might consider fraud - people receiving benefits when they have the ability to work - is often just abuse of the system by taking advantage of certain rules and structures that allow people who can perform some work to nevertheless receive benefits.”
What constitutes abuse of the rules? An example, she said, would be claiming SSDI and receiving unemployment benefits at the same time, or claiming based on the argument that a disability prevents a worker from performing certain types of jobs. 
Greszler and other SSDI critics often point to the rise of SSDI applications and award grants coincident with the rise of unemployment during the Great Recession as evidence of abuse. Some academic research has been done suggesting a cause-and-effect related to the unemployment rates, but this is hardly a settled matter among experts on SSDI.
Heritage has a broader agenda for SSDI reform. This week, it released a paper outlining 16 reforms aimed at improving the program’s solvency and integrity. (https://herit.ag/2FEBLDF) It includes the plan to use social media surveillance in eligibility determinations, tighter eligibility definitions and replacement of SSDI's progressive benefit formula with a ""flat anti-poverty benefit."" It also urges greater use of private disability insurance, especially among higher-income workers.

This agenda draws its fuel from the fraud and abuse arguments. So any debate about reforms should also include rebalancing our perspective on where the problems are in SSDI - and where they are not.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",What is the scariest retirement healthcare number?,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A typical couple could potentially spend $285,000 on out-of-pocket healthcare costs in retirement. 
But that is hardly the scariest number you need to consider when it comes to medical costs as you age. 
This estimate, released on Tuesday by Fidelity Workplace Consulting, is based on Medicare premiums for Americans 65 and older, plus the deductibles and co-pays required for medical care and prescription drugs. It also accounts for inflation and investment growth.
If you have $1 million in retirement savings and plan to spend a healthy 4 percent of that per year plus Social Security, your monthly healthcare budget would need to account for about $5,000 per year per person. 
These bulk figures sound large, yet what is not included may be even more worrisome:
- Long-term care
Since Medicare, the government health plan for those over 65, does not cover long-term care costs, Fidelity's average spend does not include it either. 
But this is where you find the big price tag. The average cost of nursing care is more than $80,000 per year according to the Administration on Aging, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Home healthcare can be even more expensive at $20 an hour. 
While Medicaid is a government safety net for low-income individuals of any age, it does not work for all nursing homes, nor for home care. The only way to insure against running out of money for private-pay nursing homes or home care is to get long-term care insurance. The problem? It is so expensive that even the companies selling long-term care policies are getting out of the business. 
Genworth, the biggest provider, just announced that it is not going to sell traditional individual policies and hybrid ones with annuities through brokers. While group policies and direct-sales will still be available, it is just one more contraction in an already shrinking market. 
There are still ways to protect yourself. Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, favors a some-is-better-than-none approach. Limited long-term care policies, which have lower premiums and lower benefits, sold by companies such as New York Life and Mutual of Omaha, will at least pay some of your costs, he said.
- Dental and vision
Medicare does not cover dental and vision costs. The good news? ""Those are things most people can anticipate and afford,"" said Hope Manion, senior vice president, Fidelity Workplace Consulting
As 66-year-old Slome learned in a year on Medicare, it is hard to let go of savings you worked so hard to accumulate. Slome noted this as he was about to head out to the optometrist for a long-avoided update to his eyewear. 
""I was moving something in the garage and a hedge clipper scratched the glasses. I have distance glasses and computer glasses and reading glasses. All three pairs will be redone – this is a thousand-dollar visit,"" Slome lamented. 
A smart way to leverage retirement savings for ad hoc medical costs is through health savings accounts, which allow triple-tax-free savings for healthcare costs, Manion said. You will need a high-deductible health plan to qualify, however. 
- Pre-Medicare healthcare costs
Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 are the ones who need to worry most about healthcare costs, because some people cannot keep working even if they want to. Fifty-four percent of people in this age group are worried about covering healthcare costs before Medicare kicks in, according to a recent survey from AARP. 
""That age band is really scary,"" Manion said. ""That's when premiums skyrocket.""
This is also typically the time when chronic health conditions worsen and doctors pile on prescriptions as well as procedures. Medicare does a better job managing these costs than private-pay insurance, Manion said. 
Last year Slome went into the hospital just a few weeks before he became eligible for Medicare. In three days, he blew through $6,500, all out-of-pocket costs because he had a high-deductible plan. 

""Three weeks later, it would have been zero!"" Slome said.

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare plan and pharmacy benefits manager Magellan Health Inc is nearing an agreement with Starboard Value LP to expand the size of its board by several seats, including a representative from the activist hedge fund, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Magellan did not respond to a request for comment. Starboard declined to comment.
Starboard, which owns 9.9 percent of the company, said in February that it wanted to put six directors on the board and sent a letter to shareholders arguing that management should be looking at a number of options, including a sale.
The hedge fund said that although the company operates in an industry that is poised for growth, it has underperformed because of operational missteps and poor capital allocation.
Reuters reported that Magellan, which has a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion, would explore a sale after facing pressure from Starboard. 
Starboard nominated two employees, including Peter Feld and Gavin Molinelli, as director candidates as well as four independent director candidates with expertise in corporate turnarounds and life sciences.
Starboard has been stepping up its healthcare campaigns lately. Earlier this year, Starboard said it is opposing Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's plan to buy biotech company  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG). The hedge fund also nominated directors at Bristol.
Previously it has had mixed success in healthcare including its efforts at Perrigo Company Plc and Assertio Therapeutics Inc.
Over the last 52 weeks, Magellan's share price has fallen 38.7 percent but it is up 14.75 percent since January, when Starboard began to make noise about getting involved.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled a net of nearly $11 billion in assets out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. equities last week, the largest retreat from domestic stocks since the final week of January, Investment Company Institute data released on Wednesday showed.
The move came during the final week of the best quarter for the benchmark S&P 500 index since 2009, and the best first quarter since 1998, according to Refinitiv data. The S&P 500 is up nearly 15% year to date, boosted in part by hopes for a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate hikes.
With last week's pullback, investors have now sold a net total of about $10.2 billion in assets from domestic stock funds over the 12 full weeks of the year, ICI said.
Investors pulled a net of $190 million out of world stock funds last week, continuing a six-week retreat from the category that began in late February. Despite those losses, world stock funds have brought in a net of about $4.3 billion in assets for the full year to date.
Bond funds added a net of nearly $7.9 billion, continuing a streak of positive inflows that dates to the first full week of the year. Over that time, investors have sent a net of about $112 billion into funds that hold either taxable or municipal bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund, one of the world's largest bond funds, is up 2.6 percent for the year to date.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Third Point LP returned 9 percent in the first quarter of 2019 fueled largely by gains at Nestle, which was publicly critiqued by the hedge fund in 2018 for its ""muddled strategic approach,"" an investor said.
The Swiss-based food giant, maker of KitKat bars and Perrier water, contributed 1.5 percent in gains to $14 billion Third Point's portfolio during the first three months of the year, the investor said. Nestle has gained 19.54 percent since January.
Third Point, which includes activism in its lineup of investment strategies, took a roughly $3 billion stake in Nestle in 2017 with an eye to pushing the company to perform better. It watched quietly from afar until last summer when the firm's billionaire founder Daniel Loeb publicly told executives to be ""sharper"" ""bolder"" and ""faster"" in spinning off businesses and untangling the company's complex management structure.
Since then Third Point has taken on a more muted posture, saying in its fourth quarter shareholder letter that ""it's becoming increasingly clear that real change is underway in Vevey,"" where Nestle is based. Privately the firm is clearly supportive of CEO Mark Schneider's moves with some people saying the relatively new leader is doing things the right way.
For Third Point and its clients, this year's early gains are a salve after last year's 11 percent drop, which was only the second double digit decline in the firm's 24 year history.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 06:31PM ET</span>",Jet Airways lenders to push forward with rescue plan; no clarity on interim funding,"(Reuters) - Lenders to India's Jet Airways said on Thursday that they intend to push forward with their plan to rescue the troubled airline, but offered no clarity on interim funding, leaving the future of the carrier hanging in the balance.
Last month, Jet's lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI) , agreed to bailout the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a majority stake, while seeking out an investor to help revive the company's fortunes.
The rescue plan also included a $218 million interim loan to keep the airline afloat.
However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters late on Thursday that the lenders, which also includes Punjab National Bank (PNB), were yet to decide on the interim loan for the beleaguered carrier.
The two state-run banks, SBI and PNB, did not have immediate comments on the matter.
In their joint statement issued late on Thursday, the lenders said they intend to pursue the previously proposed rescue plan ""in a time-bound manner under the present legal and regulatory framework.""
Jet, India's oldest private carrier, has been saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, compounding its financial woes and forcing it to ground more than two-thirds of its fleet.
However, the Indian government is keen to see that the airline survives, as its failure will result in tens of thousands of direct and indirect job losses, potentially denting sentiment just as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to secure a second term in a general election set to commence later this month.
Senior government sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that the Indian government had asked state-run banks to keep the airline flying.
It is crucial for India to ensure the survival of Jet as the fall of its second-largest airline could have ""disastrous consequences for the investment climate"" in the sector, a top government official had told Reuters.
In Thursday's statement, Jet's lenders said they plan to seek expressions of interest in the airline from potential investors from April 6 and that all submissions from interested parties are expected to be completed by April 9.

The lenders said they would consider other options should the stake-sale process ""not result in an acceptable outcome.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 stock index edged higher, nearing a six-month high on Thursday, with losses in technology stocks countered by gains in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) as investors waited for more clarity on the U.S.-China trade talks.
Negotiations continued in Washington after meetings last week in Beijing, as the two countries worked toward resolving their long-standing trade dispute, which has cast a shadow over global economic growth.
U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side in the talks, on Thursday.
Hopes of a trade deal have helped fuel the S&P 500's strong start to the second quarter. It has reached its highest level since Oct. 9 and is only 1.75% below its all-time closing high.
Also helping investor sentiment, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell to a 49-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength.
""You look at the jobless claims number, you're seeing potential progress on a trade deal,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. ""That's why there's a little bit more of a pick-up here.""
Investors will get a clearer picture of the U.S. labor market on Friday, when the non-farm payrolls report is expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 166.5 points, or 0.64%, to 26,384.63, the S&P 500 gained 5.99 points, or 0.21%, to 2,879.39 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.77 points, or 0.05%, to 7,891.78.
Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher. Conversely, the technology sector fell 0.4%.
Gains in Facebook and Boeing shares helped push the S&P 500 forward.
Facebook rose 1.4%, contributing to a 0.7% gain in the communication services sector, after brokerage Guggenheim upgraded the social media company's stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral.""
Boeing climbed 2.9%, adding the most to gains on the Dow and the S&P industrial index, which rose 0.6%.
Ethiopian investigators urged Boeing to review its flight control technology in the first public findings on the March crash of a 737 MAX jet. A  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst said the report potentially took the worst case scenario of an entirely new cause off the table.
But the Nasdaq snapped a five-day run of gains, as it was pressured by a fall in the shares of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Tesla shares tumbled 8.2% after the electric carmaker's deliveries fell 31% in the first quarter.
They pared some losses in afternoon trading as Chief Executive Elon Musk's role at the company appeared safe, with a federal judge in Manhattan urging the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 36 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.33 billion shares, compared with the 7.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) - A bigger-than-expected drop in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc deliveries spooked stock and bond investors, raising concern about the electric-car maker's ability to make money as Chief Executive Elon Musk headed into another legal tussle with regulators on Thursday.
The company's shares fell 8.7 percent, with four Wall Street brokerages cutting their price targets on the stock after deliveries of Tesla's higher-priced luxury cars - Model S and X - more than halved in the first quarter.
The implications of slowing deliveries on cash flow for a company saddled with billions of dollars in debt rattled bond investors, pushing the price of its $1.8 billion junk bond down by the most in seven months.
RBC analysts called Model S/X deliveries ""very disappointing"" and estimated the numbers would translate to a more than $1 billion shortfall in revenue compared to previous estimates.
The company had flagged in February that it expected to post a first-quarter loss as it launched its cheaper $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan.
Musk, who is under pressure to deliver Model 3 to new international markets efficiently, has been engaged in a public disagreement with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla's production estimates.
His lawyers will argue on Thursday that he did not violate a fraud settlement with the U.S. SEC and should not be held in contempt, the latest twist in a high-profile battle between the billionaire and the government. [nL1N21L0WY]
""With Musk due in court to face the SEC imminently, Tesla remains one of the most absorbing companies we cover, and one which for good or ill, never ceases to surprise,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said before a Manhattan federal court hearing.
Musk's fight with the SEC has raised investor worries that it could lead to restrictions on his activities or even his removal from Tesla, while distracting him at a pivotal point in the company's expansion.
In the quarter, Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s, the linchpin of its growth strategy, falling short of analysts' estimate of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla also pinned the blame for the first-quarter delivery drop to longer transit times, which analysts said could impact cash flow, even though the company claimed it had sufficient cash on hand.
The company said it had delivered only half of the quarter's numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter.
Cowen and Co analysts said that the delivery and transit details suggested ""cash was likely dangerously low"" after Tesla paid off a $920 million convertible bond obligation in cash in the beginning of March.
Still, there were no new downgrades by brokerages on Tesla shares. The company is rated ""buy"" or higher by 12 of the 30 brokerages covering the company, seven ""hold"" and 11 ""sell"" or lower.
The carmaker reaffirmed its forecast to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for the new Model 3 outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.
Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope called the numbers ""more shocking than disappointing"" and said there remain doubts whether Tesla could deliver 400,000 cars this year.
Tesla is rated six notches into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, territory by both Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. Both rating agencies have a negative outlook on the company's debt.

The bond's yield spread, the measure of additional compensation demanded by investors to own the security rather than safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, widened by 50 basis points.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will ask  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for a merger with a state-backed rival, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
The official said that Deutsche would be required to have the buffer, which has yet to be calculated, to cope should it experience setbacks while integrating Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) if a deal is agreed. 
The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe's third-largest bank from Germany's top two lenders, Deutsche and Commerzbank, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis. 
Government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the banks' future.
While Deutsche has argued the case that little or no capital may be needed, regulators, worried about the group's U.S. investment bank and the potential fallout of it failing a stress test there in September, are putting their foot down.
The ECB, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment.
With much left to be negotiated in any deal, the size of a capital hole remains unclear but is expected to run into billions of euros.
A merged entity could need up to 10 billion euros ($11.22 billion) of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up.
Deutsche Bank's exploratory merger talks with Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany's finance ministry, which is worried about Deutsche's future.
A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group. Germany currently holds a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank after a bailout during the financial crisis. 
The banks announced on March 17 that they were in talks to merge and a preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward with a merger is expected within days.
Deutsche Bank came under increased pressure on Thursday to move forward on a tie-up with Commerzbank after Italy's UniCredit was named as a potential alternative bidder for the German lender.
UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche fall through, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. 
A potential merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank has met stiff resistance from labor unions fearing jobs cuts, and from some major investors.
Lawmakers are also warning Germany's finance minister they will block any attempt to invest public money in a merged Deutsche and Commerzbank.

(Reuters) - Audio components maker Knowles Corp has hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) investment bankers to advise it on its defense against demands by shareholders Caligan Partners LP and Falcon Edge Capital LP to seek a review of its Precision Devices unit, according to a source familiar with discussions between the parties.
The source also said the two funds, which together hold more than 6.7 percent of Knowles and are seeking to nominate two new members to its board, are still prepared to work cooperatively with the company on solutions. 
Shares in Knowles have risen about 3 percent since Caligan and Falcon went public with their demands at the end of last week, after settlement talks between the shareholders and the company stalled.
JPMorgan's involvement in the conflict was first reported earlier on Thursday by Dealreporter. 
The source said the funds were unwilling to agree to demands by Knowles that the funds enter a two-year stand-still agreement in return for a single board seat.
After an overwhelming vote in favor of de-staggering the company's board at its last annual meeting, six of Knowles' board members will be up for re-election at a 2020 shareholders' meeting. A two-year standstill agreement would require the activists to vote in favor of all board proposals till 2021.
While Caligan and Falcon were open to settling for one seat instead of two, the stand-still demand, described as ""off-market"" in the funds' letter https://thefutureofknowles.com/doc/BoardLetter.pdf dated March 29, was a dealbreaker, the source said.
Caligan and Falcon Edge also posted a presentation (https:// on Wednesday, demanding the company release detailed financials for its struggling Intelligent Audio segment.
The funds said they believe Knowles' stock could reach at least $28 per share in value by the end of the year if the company listened to their feedback. 
JPMorgan, Caligan Partners, Falcon Edge and Knowles Corp declined to comment.

1454,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Nonfarm Payrolls Forecast to Bounce Back
Trading direction tomorrow is almost certain to hinge, as usual, on the monthly employment report.
The Labor Department will release its measures of the employment situation for March at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), following up on a very disappointing payrolls number for February.
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 175,000 last month, bouncing back from a weak gain of just 20,000 in February, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
“We expect to see employment gains driven primarily by health care and professional services,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk wrote in a note. “Construction jobs should come back after suffering large, weather-related losses in February.”
The unemployment rate is forecast to have remained at 3.8%. Average hourly earnings, a measure of wage inflation, are seen up 0.2% for the month.
The stock market, once again, finds itself in a tricky, but familiar situation, where it’s unclear what will be a good number for equities.
A really strong rebound might raise the specter of the Federal Reserve considering tightening down the line. Another anemic rise and that could spook the bond market about economic growth, pushing yields down again.
Labor market indicators leading up to the report have been mixed, with ADP’s private sector payrolls rising much less than anticipated, while initial jobless claims fell to a multi-decade low.
2. U.S. Rig Count Data Eyed
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production amid the ongoing tug of war between U.S. shale and OPEC.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell to 816 from 824 the week before. The oil-rig count has declined 4.8% since mid-February.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
OPEC’s crude production fell for a fourth month in March, led by Saudi Arabia as the Kingdom continues to go above and beyond the cuts stipulated in the oil cartel's latest production-cut agreement.
At the same time, however, U.S. oil producers continued to maintain record output at 12.1 million barrels a day, the EIA said on Wednesday.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 36 cents lower at $62.10 a barrel.
3. Fed’s Bostic to Speak
Federal Reserve remarks could get some added attention tomorrow given that the market is aflutter about President Donald Trump’s reported decision to nominate former presidential candidate and Godfather’s Pizza CEO Herman Cain to the Fed Board.
Tomorrow, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at 3:30 PM ET (19:30 GMT).
Bostic will speak on ""Disruption and Opportunity: Shaping Policy in a Digital World"" at Georgia State University in Atlanta. There will also be a Q&A."
1455,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Rallies on Trade Hopes, Surge in Boeing ","Investing.com – The Dow rallied on Thursday, driven by gains in Boeing and optimism that the U.S. and China are closing in on a trade deal.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.64%, the S&P 500 gained 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.05%.
President Donald Trump stoked investor optimism over a China-U.S. trade deal, saying talks were ""moving along nicely.""
But the president also cautioned that ""if it’s not a great deal, we’re not doing it.""
Trump's upbeat assessment helped ease investor uncertainty following mixed reports on trade. Myron Brilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive vice president, said a trade deal is unlikely to be announced this week, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported a day earlier that Trump may announce plans for a summit with China’s President Xi Jinping later today when he meets with the country’s vice premier, Liu He.
Trade-sensitive industrials pushed the broader market higher, led by Boeing (NYSE:BA), up 2.9%. Boeing's gain contributed 75 points to the Dow's gain and came even as the aircraft maker acknowledged similarities between two deadly crashes in recent months of its 737 MAX jetliner.
A preliminary report showed that an Ethiopian Airlines flight crew followed Boeing's procedures to regain control of the plane before impact last month.
Boeing on Wednesday said its updated MCAS anti-stall software on 737 MAX 7 ""worked as designed"" in a test flight designed to test failure in a range of different scenarios.
Energy also powered the broader market higher despite U.S. oil prices settling 36 cents lower for the day.
In communication services, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended the day higher, with the latter supported by an upgrade from to buy from neutral at Guggenheim.
The upgrade arrived despite concerns about headwinds likely to weigh on growth.
""We still view the company’s video strategy as undeveloped and see the economic opportunity as limited without uniquely recognizable content and a presence on the television screen to complement the mobile experience,"" Guggenheim said.
In other company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slumped 8.2% after the electric carmaker reported disappointing first-quarter deliveries, prompting worries that U.S. demand for its automobiles may have peaked.
Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating on Tesla, arguing demand was ""negatively impacted by elimination of (the) tax credit for electric cars"" and added that the disappointing results will likely result in downward revisions to earnings estimates.
CEO Elon Musk, meanwhile, said that he was ""happy"" with Judge Alison Nathan's decision on contempt charges requested by the SEC. The judge ordered both Musk and the regulator to resolve their differences within two weeks.
On the economic front, investors cheered a report showing a fall in initial jobless claims to the lowest level since 1969. This comes ahead of the crucial nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Explainer: Ethiopia crash raises questions over handling of faults on Boeing 737 MAX,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Ethiopia's insistence that its pilots followed procedures when their Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX nosedived before a deadly crash, and Boeing's recent declaration that a new software fix makes a ""safe plane safer,"" have set the stage for a lengthy fight over the roles of technology and crew in recent 737 MAX crashes.
After a deadly Lion Air crash in October, Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration told airlines what to do in the event that an erroneous sensor reading fooled the jet into thinking it was in a stall and pushed the nose down.
The Ethiopian Airlines pilots initially followed the advice to shut off the MCAS anti-stall system but later reversed the command counter to guidance at a time when they were traveling beyond maximum operating speeds, according to data contained in a preliminary report released on Thursday and experts on the jet.
WHAT ARE THE PROPER PROCEDURES?
If MCAS misfires, forcing the nose down in a maneuver similar to a condition that pilots know as runaway trim, pilots are supposed to hit two cut-out switches at the plane's center console to turn off power to the electric trim system. 
Under normal circumstances, trim is used to keep an aircraft flying level, but the MCAS makes automated nose-down movements.
Data from the Ethiopian Airlines flight indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a ""neutral"" attitude when pilots hit the stabilizer cutout switches to disable the MCAS system, the preliminary report showed.
That would make the situation harder to manage, possibly accounting for their decision to turn the system back on.
Boeing's checklist for pilots tells them to ""control airplane pitch attitude manually with control column and main electric trim as needed"" before hitting cut-out switches and turning to a rarely used manual wheel to keep the plane's nose in the proper position. It does not describe a specific trim setting for the pilots to achieve.
WOULD THE PROCEDURES WORK?
Experts are questioning whether the procedures outlined after the Lion Air crash were comprehensive enough to ensure pilots could recover from a real-life cockpit emergency with several distractions at a low altitude shortly after take-off rather than in a pre-planned simulator ride.
A 737 MAX pilot said the resistance on the control yoke would be about four times normal and it could take a few dozen turns of the manual wheel to return the nose to the proper position, depending on the alignment when the switches were cut.
The preliminary report indicates the pilots tried to move their wheels together but were unable to raise the nose much at all by doing so.
""It appears the flight crew reactivated electric trim,"" former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme said. ""But they only made a very small nose up adjustment - I would have expected them to immediately and without stopping move the stabilizer back into trim. The last MCAS command comes 5 seconds after their last manual trim command.""
WHY COULDN'T THEY RAISE THE NOSE MANUALLY?
The proper response to MCAS emergencies, Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said, is to correct the dangerous nose-down ""trim"" using electronic thumb switches, then turn off MCAS and trim manually with the wheel.
But if the aircraft is going too fast, those electronic switches may not be effective, European regulators said in a 2016 memo. And failing to fully fix the trim before MCAS is deactivated can make it physically impossible for pilots to control the plane, Fehrm said.
Under normal circumstances, trim is used to keep an aircraft flying level.
At speeds up to 250 knots (288 mph) pilots can stabilize trim with the manual wheel. But when the speed rises towards 300 knots and higher, the wheel becomes impossible to turn as air rushing over control surfaces makes them harder to move, Fehrm said. 
At the time when both pilots were unable to move the wheel, they were traveling at over 340 knots, the maximum operating speed of the airplane and clacker alarms were sounding. By the end of the fatal flight they had reached 500 knots.
WHY WAS THE ETHIOPIAN JET GOING SO FAST?
The plane's engines were at 94 percent thrust on take-off and remained there for the rest of the flight.
That is consistent with the pilots leaving the thrust setting in take-off mode throughout, aviation experts said.
The 737's air data computer also uses angle-of-attack (AOA) information to adjust airspeed readings. If it mistakenly thinks the angle of attack is high, it can trigger pilot warnings that airspeed and altitude data are unreliable on one of the pilot's controls, according to former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme. 
That leads to an unreliable airspeed checklist which involves turning off the autothrottle as well as setting engine thrust to 75 percent. The runaway stabilizer checklist to shut off MCAS also says to turn off autothrottle.
However, according to the flight data recorder, the pilots never reduced the thrust from 94 percent.

""The report does not address information about unreliable airspeed procedures which should be considered because they had erratic airspeed,"" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board.

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) on Thursday launched a gaming platform within its Snapchat app featuring original and third-party games such as Zynga Inc's Tiny Royale, aiming to keep existing users engaged longer and attract new ones.
Snap also announced a slew of fresh features and content for existing products, adding shows from Bunim/Murray Productions and BuzzFeed and augmented reality filters including templates of landmarks. It said it will also allow advertisers to buy ads that run outside the Snapchat platform.
Snap made the announcement at its first-ever Partner Summit in Los Angeles. The new features and content are aimed at keeping its core base of 13-34 year olds on its messaging platform longer even as overall user growth has stalled. 
Snap faces fierce competition for users and advertisers from bigger and far better-financed rivals. For instance, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's platform and Instagram photo-sharing app have copied popular Snapchat features like Stories, a personal feed of photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours.
In 2018, Instagram had about 400 million daily active users on its version of Stories, more than twice Snapchat's daily users. 
Snap must also battle for user attention against newer rivals like TikTok, a short-form video app owned by Chinese tech company Bytedance.
The number of daily active users on Snapchat has held steady or fallen for the past several quarters, but the app is still wildly popular among young users. 
Snapchat reaches 75 percent of 13-34 year olds and 90 percent of 13-24 year olds in the United States. 
""We wanted to build something that makes us feel like we're playing a board game with family over a long holiday weekend,"" Will Wu, director of product at Snap, told creators and developers who had accepted invitations to the one-day event.
""Something that makes us feel like we're sitting with friends, controllers in hand, looking at the same screen.""
The games include Snap's flagship Bitmoji Party, Spry Fox's Alphabear Hustle, ZeptoLab's C.A.T.S. Drift Race, Game Closure's Snake Squad, PikPok's Zombie Rescue Squad and Zynga's Tiny Royale. They can be played from Snapchat's main ""Chat"" messaging feature.
Snap said the gaming platform will have non-skippable, six-second video ads, a relatively new format that boosted fourth-quarter revenue.
Snap also announced a product called ""Snap Audience Network"" which will allow advertisers to buy vertical ads that run beyond Snap's platform to third-party apps. The tool has not been rolled out but Snap made the announcement on Thursday to get developers and publishers on board, its spokesman said.
The company also launched new augmented reality ""lenses,"" or filters that overlay video, including templates of landmarks like Buckingham Palace in London, the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington D.C., and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

As part of Snap's push to expose more content outside of the platform, the company also launched ""App Stories"" with partners like Tinder which would allow users to update their dating profiles with Snapchat Stories.

1460,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:19PM ET</span>","After New High, Will CSX Be Stopped in its Tracks?","By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - On Monday and Tuesday, railroad giant CSX's shares hit 52-week highs. On Wednesday, the shares fell back and are falling again on Thursday.
The question is whether CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) is peaking. That 52-week high on Tuesday was immediately followed by a pullback and the shares ended the day down 0.7%. They're off another 1.9% since. And three days of declines will tell a chart-watching investor that maybe a trend has been established.
The consensus price target for CSX, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, is $76, which doesn't suggest there's much upside. Investing.com's technical indicators rate the stock a sell.
To be sure, CSX has had a big run since the end of 2017, rising nearly 43%. The stock rebounded 20.4% in the first quarter after slumping (like just about everyone else) in the fourth quarter.
And they weren't alone in the sector. The largest railroad companies in the United States and Canada all sported healthy first-quarter gains and, like CSX, were having big years in 2018 until that awful fourth-quarter slump set in. The S&P 500 fell 20% from the end of September though the end of the year. CSX fell 16.1%.
Railroad stocks have been rising as they start to make major moves to streamline their operations and boost their financial performance. The idea is not to let rail cars sit idle in big yards until all the cars going from, say, Nashville to Detroit, are in the same place.
The trick is to start building the train to Detroit as soon as possible when the cars first arrive from various places so that the departure can happen earlier. In the long run, it means fewer locomotives and fewer cars, lower costs and higher profits and earnings per share.
The idea is called ""precision-scheduled railroading.""
The industry has, mostly, been working on implementing these ideas, first pioneered by the late Hunter Harrison when he was CEO at railroads in Canada and then at CSX before he passed away in December 2017.
CSX had such a rocky transition implementing the new system, according to The Wall Street Journal, that the federal Surface Transportation Board ordered the company to brief officials weekly.
Eventually, the problems were worked out and other railroads started to work on their own plans. Wall Street was enthralled and the stocks all went up.
The question now is if the blip CSX shares have has seen in the last few days is only a little blip or something larger.
There is a broader issue at work. Dow Theory says stocks will move higher if the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits a new high along with a new high for the Dow Transports. The Dow is closest to hitting a new high. The Transports are still 16% below their 52-week highs, mostly because airline stocks, hypersensitive to moves in fuel prices, are really nowhere near the highs reached last year."
1461,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil weighs offering coffee options to support prices - sources,"By Marcelo Teixeira
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is considering offering put options to coffee producers as a way to shore up prices at a 13-year low and assure a minimum income for struggling farmers, two people with knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Thursday.
The program, if approved, would give producers the right to sell their crops to the government at a fixed price, setting a floor for coffee prices in the world's largest coffee producer and exporter. That would likely force buyers to pay more for Brazilian coffee and encourage other coffee-growing countries to follow suit.
Producers have been pressuring Brasilia to offer put options and rebuild government bean inventories that had been sold off earlier this decade.
""We have talked to the government and they liked the idea,"" a director at a Brazilian coffee cooperative told Reuters. 
""It would be a win-win program. Farmers can be guaranteed better prices, and the government can later profit from the sales of that coffee when prices recover,"" he said.
Another industry source said he had also heard about the talks from producers that he advises. That source said that many details still needed to be worked out, such as the program's size and the level of the price floor. 
The sources asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Coffee prices in New York hit a fresh 13-year low this week as output surpasses demand in the global market. Arabica prices were trading at 95.20 cents per pound on Thursday, down 0.16 percent.
The Brazilian government has been active in the coffee market in the past, intervening with policies to help farmers when market prices were at or below production costs.
Brazil last used options in 2013, when it offered contracts for farmers to sell up to 3 million bags to the government at a fixed price. The put options required coffee producers to pay a small fee for the right to sell their coffee to the government.
If market prices are below the fixed price set for the options when they expire, the producer normally exercises the option and delivers the product to government warehouses. 
The Brazilian government sold off the beans acquired in the 2013 program when prices recovered and by 2017 had eliminated its coffee inventories.
One obstacle for the program would be the potential cost to the government of billions of reais at a moment when President Jair Bolsonaro has pledged to rein in public spending and reduce a large budget deficit.
Even if the Agriculture Ministry agrees to the idea, it would have to pass muster with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who has vowed to cut industry-specific subsidies, before getting Bolsonaro's signature.
The first source said the idea would be to launch the program in 2020, when Brazil is expected to produce a larger crop, based on its biennial coffee production cycle.

2019 is an off-year for Brazil's coffee fields, and the government expects production to fall to between 50.5 million and 54.5 million 60-kg bags from the record of 61.6 million bags produced in 2018.

MILAN (Reuters) - Three investors including Italian fashion entrepreneur Renzo Rosso are eyeing a possible bid for luxury label Roberto Cavalli, according to a document filed by the company with a court in Milan as it seeks breathing space from creditors. 
The fashion company on Monday filed a request with a bankruptcy court for 120 days of protection from creditors to reach an agreement on its debt and find a new investor, after it struggled to reboot sales and faced a cash crunch. 
Cavalli, a red carpet favorite famed for its animal prints, has been 90 percent owned by private equity firm Clessidra since 2015, and the group attempted to overhaul the label including with a new manager and designer. 
But it has posted a string of losses since 2014, with the exception of 2015, when it was back in profit after the sale of a property in Paris. 
Clessidra hired Rothschild in September to find a new investor to provide the group ""with the needed resources to overcome the difficult situation and to relaunch the business"", and it also subscribed to a 15 million euro ($17 million) capital increase in 2018, the document seen by Reuters showed. 
But the private equity investor rejected a request by Cavalli's board in March this year to pump another 47 million euros into the company, the court filing said. 
According to a source close to the situation, the fund through which Clessidra owns Cavalli has reached its statutory limit of investment.
Out of 80 potential investors contacted by Rothschild, three expressed interest in buying the company as a whole, the document revealed. 
Bluestar, a U.S. holding company which owns fashion brand Bebe, revised its initial offer but expressed ""its willingness to evaluate an acquisition of the business within the framework of a debt restructuring agreement"".
Diesel-owner OTB, the group run by Renzo Rosso which had initially denied an interest, also offered to invest in Cavalli together with current shareholders and said it was ""available to proceed with a deal as part of creditor procedure"".
German fashion designer Philipp Plein, who has his own brand, could be interested in pursuing takeover negotiations but only after an accord with creditors is reached, the document showed. 

Cavalli is liquidating its U.S. unit and closed its stores there this week.

Citron Research slapped a sell rating on the shares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)saying ""drastic changes"" -- not the good kind -- in the competitive and regulatory landscape will negatively impact the e-commerce platform's growth story.
Shares plunged 7%.
The downbeat note on Shopify comes as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Square (NYSE:SQ) and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram have made efforts to venture deeper into the e-commerce space.
Microsoft VP of Retail and Consumer Goods Shelley Bransten earlier this week said the company is considering launching a competing offering that would allow retailers manage e-commerce sales.
Instagram, meanwhile, made its e-commerce intention clear with the launch of Checkout last month, a move that creates a direct transactional relationship between retailers and users on the platform, removing the need for the Shopify platform.
Currently merchants can link their Instagram to their Shopify so that the purchase goes through Shopify's platform. Checkout will circumvent that process and cut out Shopify, RBC said in a note.
In a further sign that e-commerce platform wars are set to intensify, Square upgraded its Square Online Store and Square for Retail products to include full integration with Weebly, the website and online store builder the company acquired last year."

About 97 percent of Goldcorp's outstanding shares that were voted at a special meeting were cast in favor of the deal, the company said in a statement. Newmont had offered 0.328 of its shares and 2 cents for each Goldcorp share. 
""We appreciate Goldcorp shareholders’ vote of confidence, which moves us one step closer to creating the world’s leading gold business,"" Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in a statement. 
Vancouver-based Goldcorp shares rose slightly on Thursday afternoon to C$15.39 in Toronto, and shares of Denver-based Newmont rose slightly to $36.02 in New York. The benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index gained 0.8 percent. 
The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, will overtake current market leader Barrick Gold Corp in annual production, churning out 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years, compared with Barrick's forecast of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces for 2019. 
The $1 billion to $1.5 billion of assets the combined company is expected to shed, combined with mines Barrick plans to sell in the wake of its acquisition of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) earlier this year, is expected by analysts to fuel further sector deals.
That is a change from the last several years, when miners focused on cutting costs instead and investors lost confidence in the industry after years of dilutive share issuances and pricey acquisitions.
Thursday's vote comes after a tense start to the year for the gold industry, sparked by Barrick's hostile bid for Newmont two months ago, a proposal that would have required the Goldcorp deal be scrapped.

While that was resolved through the creation of a joint venture of Barrick and Newmont's Nevada assets, Newmont investors raised concerns about Goldcorp receiving too much of the benefits from the joint venture, which the company responded to with an 88-cent special dividend.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","Polarized U.S. politics offers opportunity for the Financial Times, says CEO","By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - The polarization of U.S. politics in the Trump era has created an opportunity for the Financial Times to attract readers who want balanced coverage with a global perspective, the London-based business newspaper's chief executive said on Thursday.
John Ridding said the FT, acquired by Japanese media group Nikkei for $1.3 billion in 2015, is increasing investment in the United States, along with China and India, after it reached the milestone of 1 million paying readers this week, a year ahead of target.
""I think we are underweight in the U.S.,"" Ridding told Reuters. ""We can and should be bigger. Clearly there has been a polarization in the media in the U.S, alongside and probably contributing to a polarization in politics.
""There is a huge opportunity for what we do, which is independent, fair, balanced coverage.""
Ridding said the company would be bringing new products to the U.S. market and would add more reporters.
The FT, famously printed on pink paper, became one of the first newspapers to charge for its content online when it introduced a pay wall in 2002. 
It established a metered model in 2007, requiring users to register and pay a charge to read more than a few articles a month before moving to a paid-trial model in 2015, which allows access to most articles for a relatively small fee.
Digital subscribers now account for more than three quarters of its circulation.
Ridding said customer data had helped the newspaper to exceed its subscriber target, in part by offering easy tools for readers to curate what was of interest to them, adding that both consumer and corporate subscriptions are showing healthy growth.
""In the B2B (business to business) side ... revenue retention is above 100 percent and volume retention is near 100 percent,"" he said. ""That has been a big part of our success, the institutional part of the business.""
Despite the growth in digital revenue, Ridding said the FT still had a future in print. It had a circulation of 171,459 in January, according to ABC data quoted by Press Gazette.
Ridding said the print product is profitable on its cover price before advertising - a rare feat in the newspaper market.
""I would certainly hesitate to write off print in the near term,"" he said.

Airbus said on Thursday it had won 62 gross orders during the first three months of 2019 but some 120 cancellations left it with a negative net order figure of 58. Deliveries stood at 162 including 134 single aisle planes and 22 A350s.

1467,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","Trump Threatens Car Tariffs on Mexico, Backing Off Border Threat","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump retreated from threats to immediately close the border with Mexico over migration, instead abruptly pivoting on Thursday to a new demand: that the Mexican government stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. within a year or face car tariffs.
“If the drugs don’t stop -- Mexico can stop them if they want to -- we are going to tariff the cars. The cars are very big, and if that doesn’t work we are going to close the border,” Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We are going to give them a one-year warning.”
Trump also threatened to impose car tariffs if the country didn’t step up its apprehension of migrants transiting through the country to the U.S. from Central and South America. The remarks, following a week of back-and-forth threats to close the border, risked further muddying the U.S. relationship with its second-largest trading partner.
""Mexico, understand that we are going to close the border or I’m going to tariff the cars,” Trump said. “I’ll do one or the other but probably settle for the tariffs. That will be a very powerful incentive.""
Trump said Mexico has improved immigration enforcement since he threatened to close the border last week. He has repeatedly used tariffs -- or the threat of them -- to achieve his policy goals, and has previously mentioned penalties on imported vehicles and auto parts.
Trump said the “whole ball game is cars,” but also opened the possibility of imposing penalties on other products as well.
Trump’s administration and the Canadian and Mexican governments last year concluded talks on a revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement that would be called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. The new trade pact is currently awaiting congressional approval. It wasn’t immediately clear how Trump’s threat of car tariffs would affect the agreement, and the president indicated he didn’t care.
“We have a deal -- USMCA -- it is all done. They are going to have to live with it, they are going to have to live with it,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m not trying to be unfair. They are going to have to live with it. The USMCA is a great deal for everybody but this is more important to me than the USMCA so they are going to have to live with it.”

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 01:12PM ET</span>","JPMorgan's Dimon urges infrastructure, mortgage reform to spur U.S. growth","By Elizabeth Dilts
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) chief executive Jamie Dimon on Thursday called for reforms to U.S. public policy on education, infrastructure and mortgages to repair what he called the ""fraying"" American dream.
""Governments must be better and more effective - we cannot succeed without their help,"" Dimon wrote in his 50-page annual letter (https:// a third of which was devoted to his argument. ""The rest of us could do a better job, too.""
As head of the largest U.S. bank, Dimon has frequently used the letter to promote his views on public policy and corporate responsibility. On Thursday, he highlighted 11 problems he said are impeding U.S. growth and opportunities.
U.S. schools are failing to prepare students for professional-level jobs, he said, and suggested that more high schools and community colleges provide training programs and internships for specific jobs. 
JPMorgan is retraining some staff in its own workforce as it prepares for jobs to be eliminated by advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, Dimon said.
Dimon also called on the U.S. government to finish implementing the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, which was passed in 2015 and is meant to provide $305 billion to improve America's highways through 2020. 
Bad mortgage rules are also hindering U.S. economic growth, Dimon said. He called for on policymakers to reduce ""onerous and unnecessary origination and servicing requirements"" and to open up ""the securitization markets for safe loans.""
JPMorgan is reviewing its role in originating, servicing and holding mortgages, given the current lack of reforms, he said.
Last year, Dimon praised U.S. President Donald Trump for the 2017 tax reform law, which lowered the business tax rate. JPMorgan invested in technology and new branches and raised employee salaries in 2018 because the reforms boosted its net income by $3.7 billion, Dimon wrote.
However, Dimon said reform is still needed to address inequities in taxes on individuals, and suggested the government expand the earned income tax credit to help the lowest earners. 
JPMorgan said it expects its first-quarter net interest income will likely be flat compared with the prior quarter and adjusted expense to be up by ""mid-single"" digit percentage compared with the year-ago quarter.

The bank reports its first-quarter results on April 12.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday that a new software fix for its anti-stall system, at the center of investigations into two deadly plane crashes, will give pilots the authority to always override the system if activated by faulty sensor data.
The world's largest planemaker, facing its worst crisis in years and the worldwide grounding of its top-selling jetliner, said its software upgrade and associated pilot training will add additional layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering its so-called MCAS system.
The system activated in the Ethiopian Airlines crash last month and also during a separate Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, Boeing said in a statement following the release of preliminary findings from Ethiopia.
""Understanding the circumstances that contributed to the Ethiopian accident is critical to ensuring safe flight,"" Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement.

He said Boeing would carefully review the preliminary report and take ""any and all"" additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of Boeing aircraft.

Secretary of State for Environment Carlos Martins announced that he’s quitting amid controversy surrounding his 2016 appointment of aide Armindo dos Santos Alves. News website Observador reported earlier in the week the two men are cousins.
Costa, who accepted Martins’ resignation, is under fire from opposition parties for leading a government staffed with officials who are related to each other, including a married couple and a father and daughter. The controversy has caused unease in the minority government, which faces a general election in October.
""I understand that this is a subject that can harm the government, the Socialist party and the prime minister,"" Martins said in a statement released by the Environment Ministry.
Internal Administration Minister Eduardo Cabrita serves in the government along with his wife, Seas Minister Ana Paula Vitorino, while Presidency Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva is the daughter of Labor Minister Jose Antonio Vieira da Silva.
Costa says no one in the government has their job due to family ties. The total population in Portugal was estimated at 10.3 million people in 2017, according to the country’s national statistics agency.
“The idea that this is a closed government is false,"" Costa said in parliament on Thursday. ""I’ve never appointed anyone because of their family ties.""
The prime minister also said it’s unacceptable for a government official to directly appoint a family member to a post.
Rui Rio, the leader of the center-right opposition Social Democratic Party, on Wednesday said that the family links within the government have “surpassed all limits.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European spirits makers say they are facing difficulties exporting drinks to Indonesia amid tension after Jakarta said it was unhappy with an EU decision that palm oil should not be considered a green fuel.
SpiritsEurope, which represents major European spirits makers and national associations, said on Thursday it had learned from members with business in Indonesia that they were suffering delays in securing approval to import EU products into the country.
Indonesia regulates imports of alcohol through an annual import and distribution plan.
Spirits makers were finding that non-EU products, such as tequila, were securing approval, but EU-origin products were not, an industry source said.
 Diageo  (LON:DGE), the world's largest spirits company, declined to comment.
An Indonesian trade ministry spokeswoman said she was not aware of any issues.
The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28 EU countries, decided in March that palm oil cultivation in general results in excessive deforestation, setting the bloc on a collision course with major producers Malaysia and Indonesia.
The EU plans to increase its use of renewable energy sources by 2030 and to take into account deforestation when it determines what can be labeled renewable.
Indonesia, which has said it would file a World Trade Organization complaint against the EU over the palm oil issue, has threatened to quit the Paris climate agreement and has said it was examining relations with EU members.
Malaysia's prime minister told Reuters last week that the EU was risking a trade war over palm oil.
The European Commission said it was checking the situation on the ground and looking into possible additional measures applied to imports of alcohol from the EU.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is considering a secondary listing for its subsidiary ADNOC Distribution overseas, three sources told Reuters.
In 2017 ADNOC listed 10 percent of ADNOC Distribution, the largest operator of petrol stations and convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates, on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.
Reuters reported last June that ADNOC was considering selling another 10 percent stake in its fuel distribution business.
ADNOC Distribution was seeking a minimum free float of 15 percent to improve its chances of joining the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and attract more international investors, a source told Reuters at the time.
One of the sources said ADNOC was considering listing ADNOC Distribution on New York's Nasdaq exchange, while a second source added that a London listing had also been discussed.
The company started discussing an international listing ""a while ago,"" said one of the sources, adding that there was no imminent plan to proceed with the transaction.
The sources declined to be named due to commercial sensitivities.
A spokesman for ADNOC declined to comment on the listing but said the firm was ""making good progress in the implementation of its growth plans. This remains our focus at present."" 
The sale of more shares in ADNOC Distribution, should it materialize, would be the latest sign that the Gulf's giant oil companies are increasingly turning to international capital markets to fund expansion.
Before oil prices crashed in 2014, state energy firms in the Gulf largely financed themselves with money from their governments. But low oil and gas prices put government finances are under pressure.
Saudi state oil giant Aramco is currently meeting global investors ahead of an inaugural international bond, after postponing its planned initial public offering last year until 2021. 
For ADNOC Distribution, an obstacle to listing now is that its shares have mostly been trading below their IPO price, making it unattractive for the company to sell and for foreigners to buy if they think they can purchase the stock cheaper on the public market at a later date.
On Thursday the shares traded at the IPO price of 2.5 dirhams, after the company announced a dividend increase. 

Before the initial listing in 2017, ADNOC said it might sell as much as 20 percent in the fuel distribution unit.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>",Explainer: Europe's money laundering scandal,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The largest ever money laundering scandal in Europe is rippling through the region's banks. 
It began in the Baltics and has engulfed several Nordic lenders, notably Denmark's Danske and Sweden's Swedbank, who had large Baltic operations. 
Here are some facts about Europe's problems. 
HOW DID THE CURRENT SCANDAL EMERGE? 
The Baltics' proximity to Russia has traditionally made them vulnerable to illegal financial flows from their neighbor.
U.S. investigators raised concerns about some of the region's banks early last year, prompting domestic and European watchdogs to investigate.
WHICH BANKS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SO FAR?
The first to be hit was Latvia's ABLV, which was liquidated last year after U.S. accusations of money-laundering activities. 
The scandal spread to the Estonian branch of Danske Bank, Denmark's largest lender, which is now facing probes in several countries for handling 200 billion euros ($224 billion) in suspicious transactions of Russian money between 2007 and 2015. 
Sweden's Swedbank has recently been drawn into the scandal, after it was reported it handled some of the same payments that went through Danske, leading to the dismissal of its chief executive last week. 
COULD IT SPREAD TO BANKS BEYOND THE BALTICS AND NORDICS?
Other lenders that helped process suspicious payments from the Baltics could also be in the frame.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which acted as a correspondent bank to Danske, is under investigation over its links to the money. 
IS THE PROBLEM LIMITED TO FLOWS FROM RUSSIA TO THE BALTICS?
Money from Russia and former Soviet Union countries does not only go to the Baltics. Cyprus and Malta are among the EU states that are most welcoming of these flows, data show, with Pilatus Bank in Malta shut down last year following a U.S. probe on its owner and after allegations of suspicious transactions involving Azerbaijan's ruling elite.
But the problem is not limited to Russian flows. EU-based criminal organizations, such as Italian mafias, launder most of their illegal proceeds in the largest EU states, estimates show. 
ING, the Netherlands' largest financial services provider, was forced by the Dutch regulator to pay a $915 million fine last year over money laundering. Its Italian business is also under investigation over similar allegations.
HOW MUCH COULD THIS COST BANKS?
A lot. EU banks payed over $16 billion in fines between 2012 and 2018 because of lax money-laundering checks, rating agency Moody's said in a report on Tuesday, with U.S. regulators levying more than 75 percent of those fines.
Now the allegations have stepped up, so could the fines. 
WHO SUPERVISES THIS AND WHY DID SO MUCH MONEY GET LAUNDERED?
Despite money-laundering being a cross-border crime, it is not tackled at EU level but almost exclusively by national authorities, who often lack the capabilities to counter it.
In some cases domestic supervisors have shown little interest in acting, as reputational damages could hit national economies. Malta's financial supervisor has been found in breach of EU law over the Pilatus case, and the EU is investigating the Estonian regulator after the Danske scandal.
Many banks do not report all suspicious transactions as their due-diligence units are often understaffed.
Reports are not standardized, often producing irrelevant data and hampering cooperation among national supervisors. 
WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULTIES IN DETECTING THESE FLOWS?
EU rules to fight money laundering have been overhauled, but some loopholes have never been closed. They are also applied differently and EU states are often late in executing them.
States, including Luxembourg and Germany, use loopholes in EU rules that allow them not to disclose fines on banks in breach of money-laundering rules. This vastly reduces the effectiveness of sanctions which are mostly feared by lenders for their reputational impact.
In the latest reforms, EU legislators added stricter transparency requirements on companies' owners, but allowed them to remain hidden in some cases. Money-laundering is often conducted through shell firms whose owners are unknown. 
Data that could raise alarm bells, such as the share of non-resident deposits or oversized cross-border flows, are collected at national level, often without details of final beneficiaries. No-one checks them at EU level.

The EU has also failed to agree an updated list of jurisdictions that pose money-laundering risks because of lax rules. This reduces banks' ability to spot dodgy payments.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and China will be key focuses for the consumer healthcare venture being formed by GlaxoSmithKline and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), as the companies look to build on strong existing positions in those markets. 
GSK and Pfizer are on track to create the world's biggest consumer health business - with brands from Advil painkillers to Chapstick lip balm - by the second half of 2019, Brian McNamara, CEO of GSK Consumer Healthcare, told Reuters on Thursday. 
The venture, to be 68 percent owned by GSK, will become a stand-alone company within three years of closing the deal, and McNamara will lead it.
""The U.S. and China are really two of the key value drivers of the deal because it's where Pfizer has critical mass and a significant amount of their key brands,"" he said in an interview, noting the new entity will be the No.1 player in the United States and No.2 in China. ""U.S. and China are must-win markets.""
The consumer health sector, which spans vitamins, non-prescription medicines and other drug store purchases, is buoyed by ageing populations, a growing interest in health, wellness and self-care, and growing middle classes. It has slowed at times in recent years, due to emerging market fluctuations or weak flu seasons. 
The new, yet-to-be-named company will have annual sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.9 billion) and more than 7 percent of the global consumer health market, with brands also including Centrum vitamins and Sensodyne toothpaste. 
That puts it ahead of rivals Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bayer (DE:BAYGN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY).
Pfizer's Centrum is already the leading multivitamin in China, while Caltrate is the No.2 calcium supplement in what is one of the world's most calcium-deficient populations, McNamara said. 
He said vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) would be a major focus, alongside oral care and over-the-counter pain medicine, and respiratory treatments like cold and flu tablets. 
""It gives us the presence globally but it really strengthens our China position,"" he said about VMS.
GSK has said it is aiming to make divestments worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in 2019/2020, but McNamara declined to comment on them. 

GSK in December announced plans to separate into two companies - one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products - after agreeing the deal with the consumer health business that Pfizer tried, and failed, to sell previously.

DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - The collapse in Thyssenkrupp's share price could necessitate changes to a planned breakup of the German conglomerate and even delay the move, a top-20 investor said.
The group said last year it would spin off its capital goods units - elevators, car parts and plant engineering - effectively breaking itself in two under shareholder pressure to scrap a conglomerate structure.
The spun-off units will form an independently listed company, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) Industrials, while the remaining businesses, most notably shipbuilding and materials trading, will stay with the parent, to be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials.
Shares have fallen 41 percent since the announcement on growing scepticism over whether the move can fix the group's operational issues, hurting the valuation of Thyssenkrupp's assets, Ingo Speich of Deka Investment said.
""Profitable areas such as elevators have gained weight as a result. That could lead to a change in composition of the two companies to avoid an imbalance,"" Speich, Deka's head of sustainability and corporate governance, said in a telephone interview.
Deka is Thyssenkrupp's 11th-largest investor.
Under the breakup deal, which is expected to be approved by shareholders in January 2020, Thyssenkrupp Materials will hold a minority stake in Industrials, a shareholding it is planning to sell to bring in fresh funds.
Sources have pointed out that a falling share price will create pressure on Materials to hold a higher stake in Industrials to make up for the value decrease. The legal separation of Thyssenkrupp is scheduled for Oct. 1.
""The timetable for the split is very ambitious and could be changed,"" Speich said, adding this would not be a problem if the company focused more on improving its operating performance. Thyssenkrupp's operating margin stood at 2.5 percent last year.
Given the current downturn in the car sector, Thyssenkrupp's biggest client group, there have been concerns that the group could come under pressure reaching its 2019 profit outlook.
Several automotive suppliers have warned of falling profits in recent weeks. Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe expect Thyssenkrupp to deliver adjusted operating profit of 928 million euros ($1.04 billion), below the group's target of more than 1 billion.
Speich said there was currently no alternative to Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who took over last year after a months of turmoil that included the resignation of both its CEO and chairman.

""He is pulling the strings and is therefore irreplaceable.""

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 10:28AM ET</span>",Target Boosts Its Minimum Starting Wage as War for Workers Rages,"(Bloomberg) --  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) is boosting its minimum starting wage for the third time in as many years, distancing itself from rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. in a tight labor market.
The cheap-chic retailer will move to $13 an hour in June, providing tens of thousands of workers a raise, the company said, without specifying exactly how many staffers would benefit. This follows $1-an-hour increases in recent years and brings Target closer to the goal it set in 2017 of reaching $15 an hour by the end of next year.
“Investing in our team members is essential to keep our business growing and thriving,” Target Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer said in a company blog post.
The move is the latest salvo in an ongoing wage war between the nation’s biggest retailers. The industry is the largest private-sector employer in the U.S., and competition for staff has intensified.
Walmart has also boosted wages several times in recent years to reach its current starting salary of $11 per hour, and has also expanded benefits like maternity and parental leave. Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST)., which often leads the retail pack on pay, just boosted its starting wage to as much as $15.50 an hour, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). moved to $15 last year.
While the job market remains tight, there are signs of slack that could come back to haunt Target and others. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in February, but U.S. companies added the fewest workers in March since late 2017, according to data from the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute.
The downshift in hiring is the result of slowing economic growth and the waning effect of tax cuts, which Walmart and others used to help fund last year’s wage hikes. With that benefit gone, rising labor and transportation costs could crimp retailers’ performance this year, analysts have warned.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to issue a multi-billion-dollar tender in 2020 to construct its first two nuclear power reactors and is discussing the project with U.S. and other potential suppliers, three sources familiar with the plans said.
The world's top oil exporter wants to diversify its energy mix, adding nuclear power so it can free up more crude for export. But the plans are facing Washington's scrutiny because of potential military uses for the technology.
Saudi Arabia, which aims to mine for uranium, says its plans are peaceful. But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in 2018 the kingdom would develop nuclear arms if Iran did.
U.S., Russian, South Korean, Chinese and French firms are in talks with Riyadh to supply reactors, a promising deal for an industry recovering from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
""Saudi Arabia is continuing to make very deliberate steps forward although at a slower pace than originally expected,"" one of the sources familiar with the plans told Reuters.
Saudi officials previously said they aimed to select a vendor in late 2018, which then slipped to 2019. The sources said the tender would now be issued in 2020.
Two sources said the project was proceeding slowly partly because the kingdom was still in discussions with all potential suppliers rather than narrowing them down to a short list.
The plans have also been delayed by strained ties with Washington, which criticized Riyadh after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate in October, a source familiar with the talks said.
Riyadh needs to sign an accord on the peaceful use of nuclear technology with Washington to secure the transfer of U.S. nuclear equipment and expertise, under the U.S. Atomic Energy Act. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said last week that the negotiations which began in 2012 were continuing.
The source said Washington has also been seeking to convince Riyadh to sign the International Atomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol on extra safeguards for verifying nuclear technology is used for peaceful applications. The kingdom has so far resisted, the source added.
The fate of these negotiations could determine whether Riyadh reaches a deal with U.S. firms, the source said.
WORKSHOPS
Saudi Arabia, which sent a ""request for information"" (RFI) to nuclear vendors in 2017, is holding workshops with vendors from five nations as part of the pre-tender process, one source said, adding that this was expected to last 12 to 15 months.
The King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE), tasked with developing the nuclear program, has brought in an executive from oil giant Saudi Aramco to help manage the pre-tender consultancy process, two sources said.
The Energy Ministry, overseeing the project, and the kingdom's international press office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
KACARE has in the past said the kingdom was considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity by 2032, requiring about 16 reactors. But the sources said the focus for now was on the first two reactors and a potentially smaller program.
Neighboring United Arab Emirates is building a nuclear power plant, the first in a Gulf Arab state. Iran, across the Gulf, has a nuclear plant in operation and has been locked in a row over its nuclear ambitions with the United States.
Saudi Arabia, which has long vied with Iran for regional influence, has said it will not sign any deal with the United States that deprives the kingdom of the possibility of enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel in the future, both potential paths to a bomb.
South Korea's state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO), Russian state nuclear group Rosatom, French utility EDF (PA:EDF), state-run China National Nuclear Corp and U.S. Westinghouse have expressed interest in the Saudi project.

1494,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 09:23AM ET</span>",Trump's tax cuts added $3.7 billion to JPMorgan's profits,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon hailed President Donald Trump's tax cuts in the bank's  annual investor letter on Thursday, saying the law gave a boost to earnings to the tune of $3.7 billion. 
The letter outlined the bank's record earnings performance ""even without the impact of tax reform.""
JPMorgan made a record profit in 2018, posting net income of $32.5 billion and an astonishing $111.5 billion in sales, ""reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses.""
Dimon added: ""All things being equal (which they are not), the new lower tax rates added $3.7 billion to net income."" 
""The new tax code establishes a business tax rate that will make the United States competitive around the world and frees US companies to bring back profits earned overseas,"" Dimon wrote in the letter. ""The cumulative effect of capital retained and reinvested over many years in the United States will help cultivate strong businesses and ultimately create jobs and increase wages.""
The bank's fourth quarter was part of an  unconventional earnings cycle for the industry, mostly because the  late-arriving tax law that has caused many banks to book losses on deferred tax assets that declined in value.
Dimon praised Trump's cuts back in January as well. 
""The enactment of tax reform in the fourth quarter is a significant positive outcome for the country,"" Dimon said at the time.
In the last five years, JPMorgan says it bought back $55 billion in stock or about 660 million shares, accounting for about 20% of the company’s common shares outstanding.
Share buybacks  have garnered backlash, as critics including US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders accuse companies of exploiting their tax windfalls to benefit shareholders instead of employees.
Dimon acknowledged the criticism of buybacks, which he called a ""no-brainer."" Corporate capital expenditures and R&D spend are also rising, he said, while ""the benefit of tax reform is the long-term (multi-year) cumulative effect of capital retained and reinvested.""
The gains from the law will be short-lived, Dimon said. 
""For the long term, we expect that some or eventually most of that increase will be erased as companies compete for customers on products, capabilities and prices,"" he said. ""However, we did take this opportunity in the short term to massively increase our investments in technology, new branches and bankers, salaries,"" philanthropy and lending."

Getting the keys into a buyer’s hands usually isn’t an issue, especially since buyers are typically eager to take delivery of their cars once ready, but that's put to the test at the end of the quarter as tight deadlines lead to high pressure inside the company.
For a small number of customers, Tesla's 10-day delivery period, as designated in the contract, sometimes overlaps with the end of the quarter. When that happens, customers are told their car may be given to another buyer. 
Current and former Tesla employees, speaking to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss internal practices, say that the practice — known as VIN ""unmatching"" — is a regular part of life at Tesla. The issue first came to light in a  viral Reddit thread last week. 
""Generally speaking, as soon as the car arrives, we schedule the delivery,"" one current employee said. ""Most people are okay with that, but the ones who aren’t, for whatever reasons, are unmatched.”
""The sole focus at the end of the quarter is to check every car 'delivered' by whatever means necessary,"" the employee said.
To be sure, customers will still receive the same model they purchase, though the VIN may not be the one originally assigned to them in the sales process. In some cases, the current employee said, it could also result in a delay as customers are re-matched.
A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.

Other current and former employees confirmed the practice is typical at the ends of quarters, when Tesla is notorious for all-hands-on-deck approaches to get cars out the door and into customer driveways. In  emails seen by Business Insider at the end of March, CEO Elon Musk told all employees that their ""primary priority"" should be deliveries.
""This is the biggest wave in Tesla's history,”  Musk said in the email. ""But it is primarily a function of our first delivery of mass manufactured cars on two continents simultaneously, and will not be repeated in subsequent quarters.""
When all was said and done,  Tesla on Wednesday posted one its largest quarterly declines in company history, with deliveries falling 34% from the previous quarter. 
""We had only delivered half of the entire quarter's numbers by March 21, ten days before end of quarter,"" Tesla said in a press release Wednesday night. ""This caused a large number of vehicle deliveries to shift to the second quarter.""
On Thursday,  Elon Musk's lawyers will head to federal court in New York for a hearing in the billionaire's contempt of court case against the Securities and Exchange Commission."

1498,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",The Renault-Nissan Alliance Against Carlos Ghosn,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The downfall of Carlos Ghosn, once idolized as the globe-trotting genius who turned France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. into the world’s biggest automaking alliance, is turning into a tale of back-stabbing politics, corporate self-interest and excessive greed worthy of grand opera. It’s hard to see how anyone comes out of this looking like a hero – and that goes for Renault and Nissan, too.
The story so far goes something like this: Act I saw the shocking arrest of Ghosn at the hands of the Japanese on allegations of financial misconduct, including using company funds for personal investments and misusing corporate assets, which bore the hallmarks of a palace coup against France’s dominance. Act II saw Renault and Nissan agree to patch up their differences and move on from the Ghosn era, with the blessing of their political paymasters in Paris and Tokyo. Act III, still underway, is a drip-feed of lurid allegations of excess under Ghosn’s tenure – corporate jets, funding family start-ups, a party in Versailles – while the ex-chief executive officer awaits his trial and protests his innocence.
How does the saga end? Judging by Japan’s terrifyingly high conviction rate of 99 percent, the odds are increasingly stacked against Ghosn. The Japanese are still digging up fresh allegations, and building up their case: Ghosn dismissed as “outrageous and arbitrary” his re-arrest on Thursday on allegations that he used millions of dollars from Nissan for his own purposes. The French state – which owns 15 percent of Renault – has been far more protective of Renault’s interests than Ghosn’s, meekly protesting against the conditions of his imprisonment. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire says Ghosn is like “any other person facing the justice system.”
But for all the talk of due process, there is obviously a fair bit of political expediency and corporate self-interest in hanging Ghosn out to dry. The case is being played out in the court of public opinion before even going to trial, and the former CEO does not cut a sympathetic figure: Wealthy, powerful, pampered and clearly not very humble. Emmanuel Macron, under fire from angry French street protesters for being a “president of the rich,” was never going to defend Ghosn with great enthusiasm. Renault and Nissan, mindful of their plan to boost revenues by a third by 2022, have an obvious desire to avoid reputational and legal risk and so have joined forces to investigate allegations of misconduct against Ghosn. 
The more tales that emerge from the companies’ investigations, the greater the risk that they have to share in the blame. Four private jets is obviously excessive – but Ghosn says the companies knew about them. Renault has alerted prosecutors to payments made by Ghosn to a distributor in Oman that may have been used to repay personal debts – but Ghosn’s team said they were performance-related bonuses. Renault said his famous Marie-Antoinette-themed party at Versailles was improperly funded via a charitable donation agreement, but the ex-CEO said he didn’t know and wasn’t even billed for the event. 
The corporate governance structure and boards of Renault-Nissan surely played their part in letting Ghosn get away with a good chunk of his imperious behavior. For over a decade, he was Chairman and CEO of each of Renault, Nissan, and the Netherlands-based alliance structure that united the two. The French government, through its stake, allowed him to stay in the top role for too long. His downfall may be a catalyst for positive changes: Renault's new boss, Jean-Dominique Senard, is said to be considering replacing at least two members of the carmaker's board to make it less of a ""rubber-stamp"" operation, according to Bloomberg News. But this is too little, and too late.
However this story ends, it’s a savage indictment of both corporate excess and the mish-mash of state interests that supported Ghosn and allowed him free reign at the world’s biggest automaker. French-style capitalism, lop-sided partnerships and Japanese justice have left Renault-Nissan looking weaker than ever.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",RBC CEO says Canada losing some of its economic spark,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest lender by market value, said on Thursday that Canada's struggle to compete with global peers is hurting its ability to grow the economy.
Canada, a G7 economy, has suffered in recent years from low productivity growth, lackluster foreign direct investment and difficulty in bringing oil, one of its major exports, to market due to a lack of pipeline capacity.
The Liberal government, which faces a general election in October, has committed to major infrastructure investment and has allowed businesses to write off additional capital investments to make them more competitive, but has opted not to match aggressive tax cuts by the United States.
""Our competitiveness is challenged. Our capacity to grow and advance our economy is stalling,"" said RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay, in prepared remarks for shareholders at the company's 150th annual meeting, in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
""When I travel overseas, I often hear concerns from investors about Canada's falling position in the world,"" McKay said.
RBC has a market capitalization of about C$149 billion ($111.70 billion), according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Data last month for the fourth quarter showed that Canada's economy barely grew due to plunging Canadian crude oil export prices and that the labor productivity of Canadian businesses fell by 0.4 percent.
Steps that Canada can take to improve its competitiveness include building digital and physical infrastructure, such as energy pipelines, McKay said.
Due to a lack of pipeline capacity, the price of Canadian heavy crude fell last October to a discount of more than $50 a barrel below the benchmark for U.S. oil.

A Canadian court last August overturned approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. The government has since bought the pipeline in an effort to save the project.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Aramco treads carefully on Saudi ties as it markets debut bond,"By Tom Arnold, Karin Strohecker and Jennifer Ablan
LONDON/NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - For Saudi Aramco and its advisers, a debut international debt issue that could raise well over $10 billion presents a key challenge - how to forge an identity as a state-owned major while in the same league as the likes of  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (LON:RDSa).
At stake is the likely multi-million dollar difference in interest payments over coming years between its standing as an independent international corporate and one tied closely to the host kingdom whose oil it ships to global markets.
Having said in January it was planning its first ever international debt issue, Aramco has been meeting with investors in Asia, Europe and the United States to promote the bonds. It hasn't commented on what was said during the sessions. 
Moody’s and Fitch said Aramco’s rating was capped by their assessments of Saudi Arabia, but unconstrained by its sovereign links it would have achieved ratings that would put it at par with the likes of Exxon, the world’s largest listed oil company.
But bankers arranging the roadshow have tried to convince crossover buyers, both emerging markets funds and pure investment-grade players, about Aramco’s merits, marketing the company as having characteristics which put it above the credit worthiness of Saudi Arabia.
“We would look at it its rating against the sovereign, but there’s a lot of interest from outside the emerging markets universe from investors looking at it against international oil majors from the U.S. and Europe,” said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Group.
Previously reluctant to do so, the oil major was forced to disclose its financials to obtain public credit ratings ahead of the debt sale.
SOVEREIGN DILEMMA
Aramco’s financial data, published earlier this week, showed it generates by far the biggest profit of any company in the world, boasting core earnings of $224 billion and a net income of $111 billion.
These figures have practically guaranteed plentiful of demand for Aramco’s issue, expected next week.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said earlier this year Aramco would raise around $10 billion, but the final amount will be determined by market demand.
Aramco is largely expected to offer investors a slight premium to what Saudi government bonds are offering, as that is generally the case with government-owned entities.
But the mismatch between its rating and its staggering finances has presented investors with a pricing dilemma.
“It has more of a double-A credit profile than the single-A rating it has,” said Samy Muaddi, emerging markets portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.
“But you have to keep in mind that if the sovereign were to get into trouble, there are some financial resources, whether they be through royalties, taxes, or dividends, that could be taken from Aramco.”
Aramco has insisted on its independence over the past few days. In an online presentation seen by Reuters, a company executive said that even when oil prices declined to $45 a barrel in 2016, the kingdom remained committed to Aramco’s governance framework to safeguard its independence.
“The government borrowed on its balance sheet for its budget needs with no ask of or interference to Aramco,"" the presentation said.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
Aramco said last week it had agreed to buy the 70 percent stake held by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) in Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) for $69.1 billion, one of the largest deals in the global chemicals industry.
While the firm said in the presentation the bonds would not be used to fund the acquisition, many investors believe the debt plans are linked to the purchase, which will give PIF, the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, cash to push through its investment strategy.
“There is a clear connection with the sovereign, it is highly coordinated policy, particularly in terms of production targets and in some cases the price of oil and where they want to sell oil,” said Ray Singh, vice president, diversified fixed income at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance.
According to Ashmore’s Dehn the “seamless” relationship between Aramco and the government is positive for investors. 
“I would imagine they [Aramco] would be coordinating with the Saudi debt management office as the government and Aramco are pretty similar issuers and Aramco’s issue would cannibalize the government to some extent and reduce the Saudi government weighting on the JPM index.”
Some bankers and fund managers expect Aramco to issue up to $30 billion or $40 billion in bonds, but company representatives have not discussed a firm target during the roadshow. 
This would allow it to focus on obtaining the right pricing without creating larger supply expectations that would impact its cost of borrowing in future issues.
Also, had Aramco announced an even larger transaction than $10 billion, this could have put some pressure on Saudi Arabia’s debt curve, as some investors would switch Saudi sovereign paper for the upcoming Aramco securities.
“But more importantly it would change the narrative Aramco put forward around the SABIC acquisition and the governance framework with the government as shareholder,” said Mohieddine Kronfol, chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments.

“A large bond deal may imply a transfer to PIF as the main motivation rather than the opening up of Aramco.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12 currently, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to attract retail workers in a tight labor market.
Minneapolis-based Target employs over 300,000 workers and runs 1,845 stores in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, grow its online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers' homes.
Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. The wage increase will affect ""tens of thousands"" of employees, a Target spokeswoman said. 
Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.
Walmart, the world's largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays workers $11 an hour at entry-level. Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for the federal minimum wage to be raised.
The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party's 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform.
""Croissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. ""Yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??""
Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March pays employees at least $15 an hour.
In a blog post due to be published on Target's website on Thursday, the company's Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer tied the minimum wage hikes to the company's strong holiday performance, saying it ""made a big difference.""
In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season.
""We were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,"" Kremer said.
It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay.

Target's spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target's previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.

1504,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Dimon Sees Recent Volatility as Harbinger of Things to Come,"(Bloomberg) -- Jamie Dimon warned investors to get ready for more wild rides like the one that upended markets at the end of last year.
“The fourth quarter of 2018 might be a harbinger of things to come,” the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). said Thursday in his 51-page annual letter to shareholders. Dimon cited a raft of issues driving the more pessimistic outlook, including uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate shifts, Germany’s economic slowdown, Brexit and the U.S.-China trade spat.
Investors face a “new normal” of liquidity constraints because of tighter regulations on banks and other market makers, Dimon said, adding that “there are growing geopolitical tensions -- with less certainty around American global leadership.”
Dimon’s more cautious tone is a shift from the full-throated optimism he’s conveyed in the past few years, and even from his last letter in 2018, when the bank forecast billions in profits tied to rising interest rates and the U.S. tax overhaul. Investors closely parse Dimon’s letters for insights even as the CEO’s frequent public appearances mean his opinions are well known.
The annual missives have more than tripled in length since Dimon, 63, took over as CEO at the end of 2005, as he’s dedicated more space to public policy. That’s helped fuel speculation the banker plans to run for president, a suggestion he’s quick to shut down.
Recession Outlook
At JPMorgan’s investor day in February, the chief of the largest U.S. bank acknowledged a growing number of potential obstacles to the economy that carried his firm to record profits last year. He said the bank is “prepared for a recession” but not predicting one, and repeated that assessment in Thursday’s letter.
Dimon has often lamented the sluggish nature of the U.S. economic recovery, saying poor policy decisions are in part to blame for slow cumulative growth. U.S. growth cooled by more than initially reported in the fourth quarter on revisions to consumer and government spending, signaling mounting challenges to the expansion as it nears a record duration.
Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s co-president and head of its investment bank, said in his own letter Thursday that recent volatility could be pinned on investors speculating that a downturn was coming sooner than previously expected. “‘Flash crashes’ are becoming more frequent,” Pinto said. “These are a function of a number of factors, including thinner liquidity across asset classes, fewer participants in the market and a growing percentage of automated trading volumes.”
Dimon also called out other CEOs, challenging them to get more involved in social and public policy. He said JPMorgan is bolstering its teams that deal with such issues.
“In the past, boards and advisers to boards advised company CEOs to keep their head down and stay out of the line of fire,” Dimon said. “Now the opposite may be true. If companies and CEOs do not get involved in public policy issues, making progress on all these problems may be more difficult.”

LONDON (Reuters) - European and Asian shares stepped back from eight-month highs on Thursday, as investors took money off the table amid fresh concerns about U.S.-China trade talks and as dire data from Germany signaled trouble for Europe.
Germany's figures showed industrial orders fell at their sharpest rate in more than two years in February, driven largely by a slump in foreign demand.
It compounded signs that Europe's largest economy has had a feeble start to the year, left the euro stuck at near $1.12, sent German Bund yields back below zero and looked set to end a four-day run of gains for share traders. [.EU][/FRX]
Futures pointed to a flat restart for Wall Street later too. MSCI's broadest index of Asia shares also lost 0.3 percent overnight after five straight days of gains had taken it to the highest level since late August.
Losses were led by Australia and New Zealand while Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indian markets were also in the red and Japan's Nikkei paused near a recent one-month top.
Chinese shares were firmer again though, with the blue-chip index ending up 1 percent which left them at a new one-year high and up nearly 40 percent since the start of the year. (SS)
""We are expecting quite a constructive agreement between the U.S. and China when it comes to trade,"" said AllianceBernstein China Portfolio Manager John Lin.
He added it was probably now a consensus view among major investors and if it proved right, would raise other questions such as whether China's government would ""keep its foot on the (stimulus) pedal or ease off a bit.""
Risk sentiment has otherwise been supported this week by signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday the two sides aimed to bridge differences during talks, which could extend beyond three days this week.
Investors are keen to see if ongoing talks lead to an earlier-than-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to sign an accord. Trump will meet Vice Premier Liu He at the White House later.
""Also an important question would be whether an agreement would be sufficient to revive business sentiment and the global trade cycle,"" J.P. Morgan Asset Management Asia Pacific Chief Market Strategist Tai Hui added.
""We believe on the margin it would help, but practically all investors we’ve spoken to in Asia in the past six months believe friction will still flare up from time to time.
Various media reported on Thursday the United States wanted to set a 2025 target for China to meet trade pledges.
The plan would see China committing to buy more U.S. commodities, including soybeans and energy products, and allow full foreign ownership for U.S. companies operating in China as a binding pledge.

Traders were also squaring off positions ahead of U.S. jobs data due on Friday after earlier disappointments this week.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",U.S. to wrap case against drug company executives tied to opioid crisis,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Prosecutors on Thursday will present their closing arguments in the trial of the wealthy founder of pharmaceutical company Insys Therapeutics Inc and four colleagues accused of contributing to the U.S. opioid epidemic by bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive fentanyl spray.
John Kapoor, who served as the Arizona-based drugmaker's chairman, and his co-defendants are the first executives of a painkiller manufacturer to face trial for conduct that authorities say was tied to the deadly opioid crisis.
Prosecutors say Kapoor oversaw a wide-ranging scheme to bribe doctors nationwide by retaining them to act as speakers at poorly-attended sham events at restaurants ostensibly meant to educate clinicians about its fentanyl spray, Subsys.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved Subsys for use in treating severe pain in cancer patients. Yet prosecutors says doctors who took bribes often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer, helping boost sales at Insys.
Prosecutors said Kapoor also sought to defraud insurers into paying for Subsys. He is alleged to have had help from 2012 to 2015 from his co-defendants, former Insys executives and managers Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan.
All five have pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy. Lawyers for Kapoor acknowledge that Insys paid doctors but contend that he believed they really were being paid to talk up the product's benefits.
Beth Wilkinson, Kapoor's lead attorney, told jurors at the trial's start in January that he had no idea about any ""side deals"" that were being cut with doctors.
Kapoor's 2017 arrest came the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. In 2017, a record 47,600 people died of opioid-related overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Two top former executives - Michael Babich, Insys' chief executive from 2011 to 2015, and Alec Burlakoff, its ex-vice president of sales - testified against Kapoor after pleading guilty to carrying out the scheme at his direction.
Babich, who joined Insys in 2007 after helping manage investments for Kapoor at the pharmaceutical industry veteran's family office, told jurors Kapoor wanted a ""return on investment"" from paying doctors to act as speakers.

Much of the trial's testimony focused on how Insys marketed Subsys to doctors. One witness testified that Lee, a former stripper who became a regional sales director, gave a doctor a lap dance at a Chicago club one time while promoting Subsys.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>","Ex-Nissan chief Ghosn calls latest arrest 'outrageous', asks French government to help","By Tim Kelly and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors arrested Carlos Ghosn again on Thursday on suspicion the former Nissan boss had tried to enrich himself at the automaker's expense, in another dramatic twist that his lawyers said was an attempt to muzzle him.
The arrest, which legal experts not connected to the case described as highly rare for someone already released on bail, marks the fourth time that prosecutors have arrested the once-feted executive, a scandal that has rocked the global auto industry and shined a harsh light on Japan's judicial system. 
Tokyo prosecutors said Ghosn had caused Nissan Motor Co $5 million in losses over a 2-1/2-year period to July 2018, in breach of his legal duties to the company and with the goal of personal gain.
The Kyodo news agency reported that the losses involved the shifting of funds through a dealer in Oman to the account of a company Ghosn effectively owned. The agency did not cite any sources.
Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, called on the French government for help.
""I am innocent,"" Ghosn said in an interview aired on Thursday with French TV stations TF1 and LCI. ""I call on the French government to defend me, and to defend my rights as a citizen."" 
It was not clear where the interview was recorded. France's finance minister said Ghosn must have the presumption of innocence and was getting consular protection.
His lead lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said prosecutors wanted to silence Ghosn who on Wednesday tweeted plans to hold his first press conference on April 11.
""The intent of the prosecutors is to pressure Ghosn, and to stop him from speaking freely,"" Hironaka said, adding that access to what they saw as additional evidence was also a likely motive behind the latest arrest.
The additional charge would likely prolong Ghosn's trial, which is expected to begin later this year, Hironaka said, adding that loss of access to Ghosn's trial-related documents could put his client at a disadvantage in fighting his case.
Prosecutors confiscated Ghosn's mobile phone, documents, notebooks and diaries, he said, along with Ghosn's wife's passport and mobile phone. Hironaka said he would release a video statement Ghosn had planned to deliver at the April 11 news conference, without saying when. 
An official for the Tokyo prosecutors' office told reporters on Thursday that authorities feared Ghosn would destroy evidence. The official declined to comment when asked about the confiscation of Ghosn's wife's possessions.
FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT CHARGES
More than a dozen officials from the prosecutor's office had visited Ghosn's residence early on Thursday and asked him to submit to questioning, broadcaster NHK said. By late morning, Japanese media said he had been taken back to the detention center where he spent 108 days after being first arrested in November.
Nissan said it could not comment on judicial decisions. 
Ghosn faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the financial crisis.
Released on $9 million bail on March 6, the executive says he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
Under Japanese law, prosecutors will be able to hold him for up to 22 days without charge. The fresh arrest opens up the possibility that he will be interrogated again without his lawyer present, as is the norm in Japan. 
Such procedures have focused much attention in the West on Japan's judicial system, which critics sometimes refer to as ""hostage justice"", because defendants who deny their charges are often not granted bail.
""It's uncommon for someone to be re-arrested a month after being granted bail. In most cases, re-arrest would occur immediately following bail,"" said Nobuo Gohara, a lawyer who heads Gohara Compliance and Law Office, which is not involved in the Ghosn case.
""Multiple arrests suggest that the prosecutor may be concerned about their chances of winning a guilty verdict."" 
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION
Nissan late last year expanded its internal investigation into possible financial misconduct related to its business in the Middle East, India and elsewhere. 
Sources told Reuters this week that French automaker and Nissan partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was chief executive.
Evidence sent to French prosecutors showed that much of the cash was subsequently channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said.
Ghosn's French lawyer has denied the allegations. 
Nissan had previously established its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Oman distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA).
Ghosn's spokesman has said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Oman firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by Ghosn and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt, the spokesman said.

Reuters has not been able to reach SBA for comment on the matter.

IKEA, which demonstrated one of the LED-powered containers at an event at a store in Kaarst, western Germany, expects to start serving home-grown salad to customers at its restaurants from pilot projects at two stores in Sweden next month.
""The conditions are perfect for maximum taste and growth and you also have the sustainability advantage because you don't have the transport,"" said Catarina Englund, innovation manager for the Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores.
The containers, managed by circular farming firm Bonbio, have four shelves, carrying up to 3,600 plants in total, fed by nutrients extracted from organic waste, including leftovers from IKEA's restaurants. Circular farming involves waste food being turned into nutrients that are used to grow new crops.
The system, known as hydroponic farming, means the plants need no soil or pesticides, and use 90 percent less water and less than half of the area of conventional farming, with the LED lights to be powered by renewable energy, IKEA said.
One of the world's biggest sellers of LED lights, IKEA also sells home hydroponic kits for hobby indoor gardeners.
Englund said about 15-20 kilograms of salad can be harvested a day from each container and the fact that the lettuce will be grown on site means production can be precisely tailored to the demand of a store, reducing food waste.

Sales of IKEA food like hotdogs or Swedish meatballs account for about 5 percent of the group's 35 billion euros ($39.34 billion) of turnover.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) came under increased pressure on Thursday to move forward on a tie-up with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) after Italy's UniCredit was named as a potential alternative bidder for the German lender.
UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche fall through, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The people said UniCredit would not crash the talks on a tie-up between Germany's two largest banks and UniCredit's focus for now was on its turnaround plan. 
Deutsche and Commerzbank announced talks on March 17 and two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday they were proceeding well but ""very carefully"". 
UniCredit's interest may now spur an acceleration.
Deutsche Bank's exploratory discussions with state-backed Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany's finance ministry, which is worried about the future of the country's biggest bank.
But a potential merger between the two has met stiff resistance from labor unions fearing jobs cuts, and some major investors. 
Lawmakers are also warning Germany's finance minister they will block any attempt to invest public money in a merged Deutsche and Commerzbank, a deal which could require up to 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) of fresh capital.
Deutsche and Commerzbank have been divided over the pace of their talks, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Commerzbank would like to see a speedy decision on whether to deepen the discussions, while Deutsche Bank is playing for time.
FRESH CAPITAL
A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group, which one German official said will need an injection of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up. 
The Financial Times first reported UniCredit's interest on Thursday. UniCredit, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank all declined to comment on the report. 
If the Italian lender were to act, it would likely see Commerzbank remaining listed but fused with UniCredit's German bank, HypoVereinsbank, one of the people said.
Shares in Commerzbank were up 3.2 percent by 0742 GMT, while Deutsche Bank stock was down 2.0 percent. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) shares were down 1.2 percent.
Any combination with UniCredit would be based in Germany while UniCredit would maintain its headquarters and listing in Milan. Reuters reported in 2017 that UniCredit had told Berlin it was interested in eventually merging with Commerzbank.
The FT reported that one of the parties might decide to walk away from the talks, adding a significant announcement could be made as early as this weekend, citing people briefed on the discussions.
Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would play a central role in any fusion, and lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank runs into trouble.

Berlin could therefore pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically or financially unpalatable.

1521,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Markets Fall on German Orders; Unicredit Eyes Commerzbank,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets were lower after early trade on Thursday, weighed down by fresh signs of weakness from the region’s largest economy and unimpressed by seemingly positive news both on Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.14 points, or 0.3% at 387.42, while Germany’s Dax was down 0.3% and the FTSE 100 down 0.6% as the pound pushed higher after parliament again voted against a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.
The sharpest drop in German factory orders in two years in February – including a 6% drop in export orders – has underlined again how much the euro zone has to lose both by a hard Brexit and by a continued trade war between the U.S. and China. The figures are consistent with a further drop in manufacturing activity in Germany in March.
However, the most interesting story out there this morning doesn’t concern trade. The Financial Times has reported that Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Italy’s second-biggest bank, is preparing a bid for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) as an alternative to the all-German union of Commerzbank and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Commerzbank’s shares are up 2.7%, while Unicredit’s and Deutsche's were both down 2.1%.
The Deutsche-Commerzbank plan, pushed mostly by the government in Berlin that wants to create a national champion, has quickly run into huge opposition from regulators, shareholders and labor unions. Neither bank’s management has appeared especially keen, either.
By contrast, a foreign buyer for Commerzbank would have the advantage of not creating a bank so large that it captured the country’s regulators. The trouble is that that leaves Deutsche Bank, a bank that is already on global regulators’ radar screens, unable to earn its way in the world and big enough to cause severe problems with the financial system if it ever gets into trouble.

While the suites have by now been restored to their old splendor, the investor has something else to worry about: the frenzy of construction that’s adding to the existing glut in real estate.
The downturn “will get much worse from here,” said Mobius, a pioneer in emerging-market investing, adding he’d hold off on buying more property. “I would probably want to wait until there’s a real slump when all this new building comes in and people are really hurting.”
Prices and rents have already dropped by as much as a third in the past five years during what S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings has called the property market’s “long decline.” The slump will run for another 12 to 18 months because government measures to stimulate the economy -- including granting long-term visas which benefit the affluent and people with specialized expertise -- won’t be enough to revive demand, said Lahlou Meksaoui, a Dubai-based analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.
Mobius recalls how he watched on television from Singapore as revelers in Dubai rang in 2016 with fireworks shooting off the iconic Burj Khalifa. Just steps away from the world’s tallest building, flames were engulfing Address Downtown and the two luxury apartments he owns in the 63-story tower.
Dubai, one of seven of the United Arab Emirates, lives and dies by real estate. When a property bubble burst a decade ago, it needed a $20 billion rescue from neighboring Abu Dhabi to pull back from the brink of default. Since prices peaked in 2014, the $108 billion economy had a softer landing as it transitioned from boom to bust.
Early signs of a bottoming out in the property sector even prompted  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to “double-upgrade” U.A.E. stocks in February. An index tracking the city’s real-estate and construction stocks climbed 5.8 percent in the first three months of the year, snapping five quarters of losses. The gauge advanced 0.1 percent on Thursday.
But Mobius said shares of Dubai’s developers aren’t cheap enough. While the World Expo 2020 fair will reinforce the city’s position on the world map, it won’t be enough to revive the emirate’s property sector unless the government relaxes its immigration policies, he said.
“That’s where you’re going to have real problems,” he said.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:15AM ET</span>",Japan's 7-Eleven to replace leader as firm considers changing 24-hour policy,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest retail group Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd said it is replacing the head of its 7-Eleven convenience store business, amid pressure to abandon its 24-hour store policy due to a shortage of workers.
Seven-Eleven Japan Vice President Fumihiko Nagamatsu will replace President Kazuki Furuya, the company said on Thursday.
The company has come under pressure to change after complaints by franchise owners, some of whom were forced to keep working amid massive snowstorms or in the wake of a family death, attracted nationwide attention.
The company's franchise system has helped buffer the impact of Japan's tightest labor market in 40 years, as store owners are on the hook to pay wages after handing over royalty fees.
The group announced a 5 percent rise in operating profit in the year ended February, led by growth in the convenience store business, although its outlook for 2 percent growth in the current year was slightly weaker than market expectations.
Faced with criticism from store owners and recent calls for change by politicians, the company recently began testing shorter hours at 10 of its more than 20,700 stores.
The 7-Eleven chain, originating in the United States but now Japanese-owned, has grown since the 1970s as its 24-hour accessibility proved a perfect match with densely populated Japan and its late-night work culture.
Analysts have said more drastic change may be needed ahead as the population ages.

Rival FamilyMart UNY Holdings Co Ltd earlier this week said it was partnering with Panasonic Corp to incorporate a range of labour-saving technologies.

1526,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",The Big Trading Dichotomy Ahead of Samsung Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a big divide of opinions on what’s next for Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.
As the world’s largest memory chipmaker gets ready to release quarterly results, questions about the timing of an industry recovery and a market rumor that one of its products is flawed have been circling around. Along with an unusual profit warning last week, that’s hurting sentiment. At the same time, Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).’s plan to cut output has lifted some spirits.
That’s led to a dichotomy: Foreign investors have bought 576 billion won ($508 million) of Samsung shares since Micron’s announcement two weeks ago, making it the most-purchased stock on South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index. On the other hand, local institutional and retail investors have both gone for the exit as analysts trimmed their estimates, projecting a drop in operating profit to 6.9 trillion won for the first quarter, which would be the worst since 2016. The company is expected to release preliminary results Friday.
“Foreign investors believe markets will be eventually normalized, with a supply control by makers that will adjust inventory,” said Shawn Oh, an equity trader at NH Investment & Securities who communicates with overseas investors. “Locals are still staying a bit on the pessimistic side on the near-term outlook.”
Samsung has rebounded 20 percent this year, almost completely erasing its 2018 plunge. That’s partly on hopes that the market for memory chips will recover as exports of Korean semiconductors jumped last month from a two-year low. Recent Chinese factory data also boosted optimism that the global economic slowdown may not be that bad, a positive for exporters such as Samsung, according to Yoon Joon-won, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management.
“Everyone is discussing when the industry hits its bottom,” Yoon said. “Memory-chip prices could probably fall again in the second quarter, but if the decline is within our acceptable ranges, we may be able to hope for a rebound in the industry. Micron’s comment is changing the atmosphere.”
Views are split on the future of the industry. Firms from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) say the downturn is likely to continue amid high inventory and weak chip sales. For DRAM, a chip memory popular in smartphones, DRAMeXchange expects prices to fall 15 percent in the second quarter and 10 percent in the third. On the other hand, Subin Lee, an analyst at Daishin Securities, says demand for memory chips may improve in the second half of the year as data centers resume their purchases.
Aside from memory-chip woes, Samsung has been struggling to stem a decline in its smartphone sales as consumers wait longer to upgrade their devices. And its display division, which supplies Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., was hurt by lower-than-expected iPhone sales.
Then the rumor that a defect was found in one of Samsung’s main products hit -- some expect the company may confirm it, and now questions are arising about the potential impact. Costs related to the allegation may be spread or expensed evenly as allowance for bad debt, Peter Lee, an analyst at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets, wrote in a note.
While the stock has rebounded and foreigners are buying, even if demand picks up, it’s hard to believe there’ll be another so-called “supercycle” similar to the one that buoyed Samsung shares in the past, according to Jung Sang-jin, head of equities at Korea Investment Management.
“The supercycle of the chip industry is still in our memories,” he said, adding he’s now betting on stocks tied to domestic consumption. “Even if the demand rises and Samsung’s profits improve to probably up to 10 trillion won in operating profit, that wouldn’t surprise us that much -- unless there’s 20 trillion won or 30 trillion won of profit.”

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:09AM ET</span>","White House's Kudlow says U.S.-China talks making progress, could extend","By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trade talks between the United States and China made ""good headway"" last week in Beijing and the two sides aim to bridge differences during talks that could extend beyond three days this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said. 
Kudlow, speaking to reporters on Wednesday at an event organized by the Christian Science Monitor, said China had recognized problems for the first time during the talks that the United States has raised for years.
Negotiations continued in Washington on Wednesday after meetings last week in Beijing, spearheaded by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
President Donald Trump will meet Vice Premier Liu He, who is leading the Chinese side in the talks, in the Oval Office at 4:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) on Thursday, the White House said.
A date for a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could be announced as early as Thursday, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified sources, which would signal that a deal could be close. But the WSJ, citing an administration official, said discussions remained fluid and those plans could change. 
The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of two-way trade since July 2018. Trump has said he wants a ""great deal"" with China and has hinted that tariffs could remain in place for some time.
Chinese commitments to increase purchases of American agricultural, energy and manufactured products are expected to be part of a final deal, and a person familiar with the talks said China would get about six years to meet those commitments, or until 2025.
The deadline was reported earlier by Bloomberg, but Trump administration officials previously said that a six-year timeline for purchases exceeding $1 trillion had been under discussion.
A final number for the amount of purchases has not been settled, the person said.
Kudlow said Liu and his team would remain in Washington for three days and possibly longer.
""We're covering issues that have never really been covered before, including enforcement,"" Kudlow said, listing U.S. accusations that Beijing engages in intellectual property theft, forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies doing business in China, cyber hacking, tariffs and non-tariff barriers for commodity trading. 
""All making good progress, all making good headway, but we're not there yet,"" he said about those areas. ""We hope this week to get closer.""
Kudlow said it was significant that China had ""acknowledged these problems for the first time. They were in denial.""
Those structural issues along with the way a potential deal would be enforced have been sticking points during months of talks between the world's two largest economies.
Kudlow said on Wednesday that U.S. charges against Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd had generally not come up during trade talks. 

Kudlow also said no decisions had been made on tariffs on auto imports coming from top U.S. allies.

Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Abu Dhabi was considering merging the two lenders to create the Gulf region’s largest lender. First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest lender in the United Arab Emirates, in a bourse filing said it ""strongly denies the report issued by Bloomberg on the potential merger"".
""FAB currently has not entered discussions with ADIB to pursue any merger activity,"" it said. ADIB, in a separate bourse filing, said the news report was not correct and that the bank is ""currently not studying for any merger or acquisition"".
There has been speculation in recent months of more possible banking tie-ups in light of the wave of consolidation sweeping Abu Dhabi.
With around 50 banks, the crowded UAE banking sector has been squeezed by decreased government spending and lower profit margins.

Abu Dhabi’s two largest banks, First Gulf Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi merged in 2017 to form First Abu Dhabi Bank while another three-way merger of Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union National Bank and Al Hilal Bank is currently underway. Two of Abu Dhabi’s largest investment funds, Mubadala and International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) were also merged.

After signals from the Treasury market in March got the whole world panicking over global growth, equity investors were encouraged by data showing China’s factory sentiment stabilized. They took it as evidence that the economic slowdown may not be as bad as feared, which in China sent the Shanghai Composite Index to a fresh high for the year. Hong Kong stocks also got a lift, entering a bull market and matching their best streak in a year. The Hang Seng Index briefly rose above 30,000 points on Thursday.
It’s a change of focus for a market that was driven by momentum and risk appetite in the first quarter. Another leg up will be based on whether data and earnings improve. Equity markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are shut Friday for a holiday.
Tough start
It was a bad week for China’s government bonds just as they were added to a key global benchmark. (Incidentally, a loss also greeted index-tracking investors buying A shares for the first time last year). A brighter outlook for China’s economy has seen traders pare their expectations for more monetary easing, while a rallying equity market is pulling money away from safer assets. It was only last month that the market was rife with expectation that we’d get another reserve-ratio cut, or even lower interest rates.
The yield on 10-year sovereign notes has surged 19 basis points since last Friday, poised for its largest weekly increase since December 2014. Foreign investors, already concerned with thin liquidity and a lack of hedging tools onshore, now have another reason to snub the securities.
Chart of the week
Hong Kong stocks finally recovered all their losses from 2018 this week. Last year was the Hang Seng’s worst in seven years.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 02:21AM ET</span>",Turkish Airlines aims to spread its wings at Istanbul's giant new airport,"By Ceyda Caglayan and Dominic Evans
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - After three false starts and a labor protest over harsh working conditions, Turkey will fully open a new airport in Istanbul this week that will give its fast-growing flagship airline a platform to challenge Gulf rivals for regional dominance.
Authorities plan to shift flights from the city's Ataturk Airport, on the edge of the Sea of Marmara, to the new airport 30 km (20 miles) north on the Black Sea shores, in a mammoth 45-hour transfer operation starting on Friday.
The $8 billion airport is one of several infrastructure mega-projects championed by President Tayyip Erdogan and will initially be able to handle 90 million passengers a year, a number which Turkey hopes to more than double by 2027.
That would make it the biggest in the world, measured against current airport operations globally.
""Istanbul Airport will rise to second place in terms of passenger numbers it serves in around five years,"" Transport Minister Cahit Turhan told reporters in the gleaming departure hall. ""When all phases are complete, Istanbul Airport will sit in the leader's chair."" 
The airport is supposed to be fully operational on Sunday after authorities transport 10,000 pieces of equipment, from massive aircraft-towing vehicles to sensitive security sensors, across the city in a complex two-day operation, after which Ataturk Airport will close for passenger flights. 
The move should support Turkey's ambition to make Istanbul a global aviation hub and will offer Turkish Airlines a chance to grow beyond the restrictions of Ataturk airport's limited size.
After 15 years of rapid growth, the airline flies to more countries than any competitor, helped by its Istanbul base which is close to European, African and Middle Eastern destinations. 
That location means many cities are within a 4-5 hour flight radius which can be flown by fuel-efficient, narrow-bodied planes. The relatively low costs helped deliver profit last year of 4.05 billion lira ($716 million).
With more slots available, the airline plans to increase its total fleet from 338 aircraft to 476 over the next four years, and analysts say it will challenge the three big regional competitors: Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad.
""It puts them on a level playing field with the Gulf carriers,"" aviation expert John Strickland said.
However there are potential risks ahead. The airport is opening just as years of strong economic growth are grinding to a halt in Turkey, and any weakness in the domestic market could prove a drag on Turkish Airlines' business.
'HUGE THREAT'
Istanbul's opening comes a decade ahead of the expansion of Dubai's Al Maktoum International Airport to handle 130 million passengers a year, which has been pushed back to 2030.
Dubai-based Emirates will one day shift to the airport, which ultimately aims to be able to handle 260 million passengers a year. For now, Dubai plans to focus on Emirates' current hub Dubai International, which handled nearly 90 million passengers in 2018.
The Gulf airlines already face testing times. Qatar Airways said last month it would report a second consecutive annual loss this year, after losing access to 18 Middle East destinations over a dispute with Gulf neighbors. 
Emirates warned in November of tough times after first-half profit fell to its lowest in a decade, and Abu Dhabi has abandoned its goal of becoming a major air travel hub akin to Dubai.
Turkey's aviation sector has become a ""huge threat"" to Gulf airlines, a senior executive at one Middle Eastern airport said, and also to rivals in Asia and Europe.
That includes Frankfurt Airport, one analyst said. It is the hub of Lufthansa, one of Europe's largest airlines, and handled 69.5 million passengers last year. It is a roughly three-hour flight from Istanbul, slightly closer than the Gulf. 
Turkish Airlines is not the only emerging rival. 
Ethiopia overtook Dubai last year as a conduit for long-haul passengers to Africa, highlighting the success of the state airline's drive to win back market share on routes to and from Africa which had been dominated by Turkish Airlines and Emirates.
Turkish Airlines has targeted fast-growing Asian economies, signing a code share agreement with India's largest domestic carrier Indigo on December, and setting up a joint venture with China's ZTO to extend its cargo operations.
""The upside of the new airport ... is its potential to tap Chinese, Indian and other emerging Asian markets,"" said Erdem Kayli, senior analyst at TEB Investment/BNP Paribas.
POLITICAL RISKS
The project has been plagued by delays and a protest last year over conditions for workers, after the government said 27 workers had died since construction started in 2015. 
Full operations at the new airport have already been held up three times. Formally opened by Erdogan in October, it has handled fewer than 20 daily flights as the full opening was pushed back first to January, then March and now April.
The opening comes at a time when Turkey's ties with the United States and Europe have frequently been strained. This presents another potential risk for Turkish Airlines - as Qatar's dispute with other Arab states has shown, politics can damage a country's carrier.
""There is uncertainty about Turkey's relationships with other parts of the world, not least the United States,"" Strickland said. ""That gives uncertainty.""
The airport is one of the showcase projects of a 16-year construction boom under Erdogan, who has overseen the building of bridges, ports and railways that have transformed the country.
Some of the biggest schemes, including a planned 40-km shipping canal parallel to the Bosphorus, have been criticized as ill-conceived and wasteful.
Some analysts question whether the airport's ultimate target of 200 million passengers a year is feasible, given the presence of a second international airport, Sabiha Gokcen, on Istanbul's Asian side.

""It seems unrealistic to expect to reach such passenger numbers, because of airspace constraints,"" said an aviation analyst at an international brokerage company who asked not to be named. ""The city has another airport, and there's a question mark whether total passenger numbers of the two airports can exceed 150 million.""

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>",Banned from internet or not? Does Ghosn's tweet violate bail terms?,"By Kwiyeon Ha and Ami Miyazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's sudden emergence on Twitter, a day before he was re-arrested on Thursday, has raised questions about whether the former Nissan Motor boss violated the strict terms of his $9 million bail - something his lawyer has denied.
Ghosn was released on March 6 after more than three months in detention for charges including financial misconduct. At the time, his legal team said he had agreed to a series of conditions, including no access to the internet and that he could only use a computer not linked to the web at his lawyer's office.
However, it was not clear how the internet ban would be enforced, and the bail terms were not made public - as is typical in Japan - making it difficult to determine details.
The issue was thrown into the spotlight after a tweet from new account @carlosghosn appeared in English and Japanese around midday on Wednesday. It said: ""I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11.""
Featuring a photo of a smiling, grey-haired Ghosn in front of a cherry tree, now in full bloom in Japan - and symbolizing the onset of spring for many Japanese - the account prompted journalists to try to ascertain its authenticity.
Forty minutes later, a blue tick appeared, showing that Twitter had verified the owner of the account. The number of followers surged to 20,000 from just a handful earlier, and by midday Thursday, the number had grown to more than 40,000.
If Ghosn violates his bail conditions, which also included installing surveillance cameras in the entrance of his Tokyo residence, the Tokyo District Court could send him back to jail and make him forfeit his $9 million.
However, his lead lawyer Junichiro Hironaka told journalists late on Wednesday that Ghosn had not violated bail terms, saying his client could access the internet from a computer in the lawyers' office provided all usage was logged and reported to authorities. He did not elaborate on the discrepancy between the conditions initially disclosed last month.
""He expressed an interest in using Twitter awhile back, so as long as his lawyers checked the content, it was OK,"" said Hironaka. ""Just sending out tweets on his own would create problems.""
""I don't know if he himself wrote the tweet, but he didn't violate bail conditions,"" said Hironaka, nicknamed ""the Razor"" for many high-profile cases he has won in a country where the conviction rate is 99.9 percent.
It is not uncommon for public figures to have assistants tweet on their behalf, dictated or otherwise.
The Tokyo District Court handling Ghosn's case said it does not disclose bail conditions and that it was impossible to say whether the tweet had violated the terms. Such decisions are left to the judges handling the case, it said.
The Tokyo Prosecutors Office declined to comment, saying bail matters are handled by the court.
Early on Thursday, Ghosn was subjected to a fourth arrest, this time on fresh charges of breach of trust at Nissan in what media reports linked to payments to an Omani vehicle dealer.
By late morning, Japanese media said he had been taken back to the Tokyo Detention Center, where he spent 108 days after being first arrested in November.
Ghosn faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the 2008 financial crisis. He denies wrongdoing.

Ghosn, in a statement provided through his U.S.-based spokesman, called the latest arrest ""outrageous and arbitrary,"" and that it was ""part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me"".

The sale was Asia's largest this year, Refinitiv data showed, exceeding property developer China Evergrande Group's $2.8 billion issue in January.
Tencent sold $2 billion in fixed and floating rate five-year notes, $500 million in seven-year notes, $3 billion in 10-year notes and $500 million in 30-year notes, it said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
The bonds will carry coupons of 3.280 percent, 3.575 percent, 3.975 percent and 4.525 percent on the fixed rate five-year notes, seven-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year notes, respectively.
The floating rate five-year note will have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.910 percent.
The tech firm earlier this week said its board had increased its Global Medium Term Note Programme limit to $20 billion from $10 billion, with proceeds going towards general corporate purposes.
Tencent had a $6 billion offshore issuance quota from China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), two people with knowledge of the deal said on Tuesday.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were joint global coordinators for the sale, Tencent said in an earlier filing.
Tencent suffered a rough 2018, as China's gaming regulator's nine-month hiatus in approving games for monetization prevented the firm from capitalizing on some of its most popular titles.

Net profit for the last quarter of 2018 fell the most since the firm went public in 2004, by 32 percent, in part due to one-off losses at portfolio companies.

White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told reporters on Wednesday that China has for the first time acknowledged that the U.S. “has a point” about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and cyber hacking.
Kudlow said it is a “significant step” toward a trade agreement, although the two countries need to iron out some other differences before they could agree on a deal.
He then added that negotiators are “making good headway, but we’re not there and we hope this week to get closer.”
The latest round of negotiations is continuing in Washington this week. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He later in the day, according to a White House schedule.
The Financial Times reported yesterday that the two sides have resolved 90% of the issues surrounding the deal.

The memo signed by Trump said that the value of global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods may rise to half a trillion dollars a year, with about 20 percent of this trade infringing upon U.S. intellectual property.
""The president has decided it is time to clean up this Wild West of counterfeiting and trafficking,"" White House economic adviser Peter Navarro said on a conference call with reporters.
Companies including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd have policies that ban counterfeit goods and have pointed to their investments in programs to keep fakes off their platforms.
The memo did not identify specific companies by name. 
""Amazon invests heavily in proactive measures to prevent counterfeit goods from ever reaching our stores. In 2018 alone, we spent over $400M fighting counterfeits, fraud, and other forms of abuse,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on Wednesday.
Alibaba said in a statement that it welcomes the initiative ""and the attention it brings to the global fight against counterfeiting.""
""Alibaba has developed best-in-class systems to protect IP and battle the scourge of counterfeiting,"" the company said. ""We look forward to further advancing the working relationship and cooperation that we have with the U.S. federal agencies mentioned in today’s order, as well as with our global commerce peers.”
The move comes as Trump and his economic advisers are locked in trade talks with China that the president says aim to reduce the theft of U.S. intellectual property.

The order requires the Homeland Security Department, together with the departments of Commerce and Justice, to provide recommendations in 210 days on how to address the problem through better monitoring and enforcement, Navarro said.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 10:09PM ET</span>",Tesla deliveries drop due to challenges shipping to Europe and China,"By Alexandria Sage and Rama Venkat Raman
SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc deliveries fell 31 percent in its first quarter as the electric car maker struggled with its first shipments of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China due to longer transit times.
But the Silicon Valley carmaker reaffirmed its guidance to deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year, and said U.S. orders for its new Model 3 - which was recently made available for $35,000 - outpaced what the company was able to fulfill in the quarter.
Tesla, whose delivery numbers missed analysts' expectations, said it had only delivered half of the quarter's numbers by March 21, with 10,600 vehicles still in transit at the end of the quarter. By comparison, only 1,900 vehicles were in transit at the end of the fourth quarter. 
""Overall, the Street was expecting an apocalyptic quarter and Model 3 deliveries were better than feared by many,"" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who noted the overall number was ""clearly rocky.""
Lower deliveries in the first quarter had been expected, as Tesla shifted for the first time to delivering its new Model 3 to China and Europe in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America and after a $7,500 tax credit was cut in half at the end of 2018.
On Wednesday, Tesla said net income in the quarter would be negatively impacted by the lower delivery and recent price cuts. The company warned in February that it would post a first-quarter loss. 
Tesla delivered 50,900 Model 3s in the quarter, falling short of analysts' estimates of 58,900, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla delivered a total of 63,000 vehicles, including 12,100 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. That was less than half the 27,550 Model S and Xs delivered in the fourth quarter.
Analyst Ives called S and X numbers poor, with Tesla focused on Model 3.
Total production fell 10.92 percent to 77,100 vehicles from 86,555 vehicles in fourth quarter. The company churned out 62,950 Model 3s, up from a total of 61,394 Model 3s in the fourth quarter.
The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla's growth strategy and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is under pressure to deliver the vehicle to new international markets efficiently, while guarding working capital. 
Musk has been engaged in a public battle with U.S. regulators stemming from his tweets about Tesla's production estimates and a judge will hear the case on Thursday. 
Although Tesla said in late February that it would soon begin selling its originally promised $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan to its North American customers, the change came too late to make a marked difference in its quarterly deliveries. 
NEW CHALLENGES
Delivering its Model 3 to international markets posed new challenges for Tesla. Musk tweeted that the company encountered ""many unexpected challenges"" when Model 3s came through the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in early February. More recently, misprinted labels delayed Model 3s entering through Shanghai.
The arrival of the Model 3 in Norway led to a surge in market share for Tesla in that country, with the car the biggest seller in Norway in March.
Still, some analysts have questioned the sustainability of global demand as European rivals roll out competing electric vehicles.
Too many vehicles in transit can put a strain on Tesla's working capital. Before Tesla's release, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated that working capital could be tapped by as much as $800 million in the quarter due to such vehicles.
Tesla said it ended the quarter with ""sufficient cash on hand."" 
    As the company strives to improve margins and post profit later in 2019, the company has laid off workers, including about half of the team hired to deliver cars in the United States, and said it would close stores to lower costs. It has since said it would keep higher-volume stores open, while announcing a 3 percent price increase on some models. 
Shares of Tesla closed up 2 percent on Wednesday to $291.81, before the announcement.

1540,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>","Bankrupt PG&E Names TVA’s Johnson as CEO, Forms New Board","(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. tapped Bill Johnson, the outgoing head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, to become chief executive officer and lead the California energy giant out of the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history.
Johnson, 65, is joining the company after more than six years at the helm of TVA, the company said in a statement late Wednesday. PG&E also named 10 new directors to its board -- including former energy executives, restructuring experts, a former federal energy regulator and at least four California residents -- as part of a management shakeup it promised in January. Shares climbed 1.5 percent to $18.75 in after-hours trading.
As CEO, Johnson will be responsible for steering PG&E through what’s expected to be a contentious bankruptcy as activist investors, creditors, wildfire victims and California officials wrestle over restructuring a utility serving 16 million people in one of the world’s largest economies. He replaces Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB), who resigned in January before the company filed for bankruptcy facing $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires its equipment has been suspected of igniting.
“I am humbled to take on this new challenge and am dedicated to meeting the high expectations that our customers, regulators and legislators have for PG&E,” Johnson said in the statement. “While the challenges facing PG&E and California are significant, by working together, we will overcome them to serve the best interests of our customers.”
The appointments follow an intense, weeks-long battle over the future management of PG&E. Even California Governor Gavin Newsom joined the fight, urging the company to resist hedge fund picks and appoint directors who live in California.
Deal Struck
On Tuesday, PG&E was said to strike a deal with a group of investors -- Knighthead Capital Management, Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management -- that own about 10 percent of the company’s shares. The deal called for Johnson to be hired as CEO, along with the nomination of the 10 new board members, people familiar with the situation said. That group squared off against activist investor BlueMountain Capital Management, which had put forth its own slate.
Among the new directors being appointed are:
Newsom didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and it remains to be seen how the appointments will be received in Sacramento.
State Senator Bill Dodd, who helped shepherd utility legislation last year, said he shared the governor’s reservations ahead of PG&E’s announcement. Newsom voiced concerns about a slate of directors PG&E was proposing to appoint last week, and the utility had made only three changes in the list it issued Wednesday, Dodd said, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
“When you look at a slate of 13 candidates, from my vantage point, with the heavy lifting that PG&E has to do going forward, that raises some real concerns,” Dodd said.
Less Than a Day
Johnson, who announced his retirement from the TVA in November, may be best known as the man who served as CEO of  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK). for less than a day. He had been appointed as part of the company’s $17.8 billion takeover of Progress Energy in 2012 but was replaced eight hour later with James Rogers, the former Duke CEO who was supposed to become executive chairman. Johnson received an exit package estimated to be worth more than $40 million.
He was appointed that same year to his post at TVA, a corporate agency of the U.S. government that supplies electricity to power companies serving 10 million people in the Southeast.
Before the appointments, Newsom publicly criticized PG&E’s plans to revamp its board with what he described as “hedge fund financiers, out-of-state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations, regulation and safety.” He urged the company to consider a board made up primarily of Californians.
BlueMountain had meanwhile nominated 13 directors including former California treasurer Phil Angelides, National Transportation Safety Board ex-chairman Christopher Hart and Jeff Ubben, chief executive officer of activist investor ValueAct Capital Management. The firm said in a statement Wednesday that it’ll “carefully evaluate the nominees put forward” before commenting.
A Worthy CEO
Johnson has already drawn some opposition.
Clean energy advocacy group Vote Solar said in a statement that his track record falls short of what “PG&E’s customers deserve.” The group pointed to the lack of solar and wind power on TVA’s coal-dependent system. Coal made up more than a quarter of TVA’s portfolio last year, with solar and wind accounting for just 3 percent, according to the company’s website.
PG&E noted in its statement that, under Johnson’s leadership, TVA retired more than half of coal generation, cutting the utility’s carbon emissions by about 50 percent over the last decade.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 09:12PM ET</span>",FAA launches new review of Boeing 737 MAX to ensure safety,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said late on Wednesday it is forming an international team to review the safety of the now-grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX that will be headed by a formal top U.S. safety official. 
The FAA said it is establishing a Joint Authorities Technical Review ""to ensure the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX"" and scrutinize an anti-stall software that's been questioned in two fatal crashes since October. 
The review will be chaired by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart ""and comprised of a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities.""
The FAA did not immediately disclose who was taking part but a Canadian government spokeswoman said Canada would join.
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two crashes - in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia last month - killed nearly 350 people.
The FAA said the group ""will conduct a comprehensive review of the certification of the automated flight control system on the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft"" and ""evaluate aspects of the 737 MAX automated flight control system, including its design and pilots’ interaction with the system, to determine its compliance with all applicable regulations and to identify future enhancements that might be needed.""
An FAA official said the review was independent of the agency's timetable for deciding when to allow the 737 MAX back into service.
A Boeing spokesman said the company looked forward to working with the panel: ""Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft.""
The review comes two days after the FAA and Boeing signaled the planes may be grounded for longer than previously thought.
Boeing said last week that it was reprogramming software on its 737 MAX passenger jet to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that is under mounting scrutiny following the two deadly nose-down crashes.
The world’s largest planemaker said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the Indonesia accident, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control. Boeing said on Monday it will submit the software upgrade to the FAA in the ""coming weeks.""
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said it was investigating claims by a number of whistleblowers that aviation safety inspectors, including some who worked to evaluate the now-grounded Boeing 737 MAX, were not properly trained or certified.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Transportation Department inspector general's office and a blue ribbon panel to be named by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao are also reviewing the plane's certification.
The FAA has for decades delegated some certification duties to Boeing and other manufacturers.
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Representative Rick Larsen praised the new review.

""Given the many serious questions surrounding the Boeing 737 MAX and the FAA’s certification process, it has become abundantly clear that an independent body must be able to review every step of the process and help restore public confidence ... well before the MAX is allowed to be restored to service,"" DeFazio said in a statement.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 09:01PM ET</span>",Ethiopia to issue first Boeing investigation report on Thursday,"By Eric M. Johnson, Tim Hepher and Jason Neely
ADDIS ABABA/SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Investigators will release on Thursday a keenly awaited report on the deadly crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, Ethiopia's Transport Ministry said, giving the first official clues to the second crash of a new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX in five months.
Some 35 nationalities were among the 157 passengers and crew who died when the nearly full plane crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in clear conditions.
The March 10 disaster prompted a worldwide grounding of Boeing's best-selling plane and scrutiny of its certification process. 
""The 10:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) press conference is to present the preliminary report,"" Ethiopian Transport Ministry spokesman Musie Yehyies said.
The report may shed light on how a piece of cockpit software came back to life after pilots initially switched it off as they tried to save the doomed jet, people familiar with the matter said, placing both technology and crew in the spotlight.
Boeing said on Wednesday it successfully tested an update of the MCAS anti-stall software that is at the center of probes in both the Ethiopian crash and October's Lion Air accident in Indonesia that together killed 346 people.
Boeing said its CEO Dennis Muilenburg joined the Wednesday test flight and that the flight crew performed different scenarios to test failure conditions. ""The software update worked as designed, and the pilots landed safely at Boeing Field"" near Seattle, the company said in a statement.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it is launching a new review of the 737 MAX.
The Ethiopian-led investigation has begun piecing together details of flight 302, starting with faulty sensor data on take-off from Addis Ababa, questions over the Boeing 737 MAX's high speed and a nosedive coinciding with the software re-activation.
The aircraft's high speed and initial climb suggests the engines were running at a higher than usual thrust, experts say.
MCAS was designed to help prevent an aerodynamic stall by issuing commands to push the plane's nose lower. However, in both cases it is suspected of firing up in response to faulty airflow data from a single sensor designed to measure the ""angle of attack,"" a parameter needed to avoid stalling or losing lift.
SENSOR PROBLEMS
Echoing the fate of the Lion Air jet, initial evidence suggests the Ethiopian Airlines jet experienced sensor problems shortly after take-off, causing the MCAS software to begin lowering the nose to grab air under the wings.
Unlike the Lion Air crew, who were flying at a time when pilots had been told little about the MCAS software, the Ethiopian crew used switches to turn the automatic system off but it later re-engaged, people familiar with the matter said.
Although aircraft experts say MCAS cannot turn back on by itself, the report is expected to shed light on whether and why the crew chose to restore electrical power to the system at the risk of setting off more automated nose-down movements.
Aerospace analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a blog post for Leeham News that pilots may have deliberately re-activated the system in order to make it easier to control the aircraft only to be overwhelmed by rapid counter-moves from MCAS.
Investigators will also look at whether the crew carried out all necessary procedures, including a recommendation to stabilize the plane using the control system before turning the crucial software off.
The pilots maneuvered the plane upwards at least two times before hitting the stabilizer cut-out switches to disable the system, one person familiar with the matter said.
However, initial flight data indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a ""neutral"" attitude when pilots hit the cut-out switches, the person added, making the situation harder to manage. 
Cockpit procedures call for pilots to leave the MCAS system off for the rest of the flight once it has been disengaged. 
GLOBAL GROUNDING
Safety experts stress the investigation is far from complete and most aviation disasters are caused by a unique combination of human and technical factors. 
In a statement, Boeing said: ""We urge caution against speculating and drawing conclusions on the findings prior to the release of the flight data and the preliminary report.""
The 737 MAX is Boeing's top-selling jet with almost 5,000 on order. Ethiopian Airlines is also in the midst of an expansion drive, while other 737 MAX customers and victims' families want answers, and potentially compensation. 
Boeing shares closed down 1.5 percent. They have lost more than 8.5 percent since the Ethiopian crash. 
Getting the planes flying again depends partly on the role that Boeing design features are found to have played in the crash, though investigators are also paying attention to airline operations, crew actions and regulatory measures.
The chief executive of Norwegian Air, Bjoern Kjos, who is a former fighter pilot, said on Wednesday he tested the old MCAS flight control system versus the new one in a MAX simulator ""under a malfunction,"" and said it appears to be foolproof.
The FAA's review of the MAX will be headed by former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart and include experts from the FAA, NASA and international aviation authorities, including Canada. 
A spokeswoman for the Canadian government said it will be a part of the review to ensure safety of the MAX.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been seeking rights to the domain name since 2012. But Amazon basin countries Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname have argued that it refers to their geographic region and thus belongs to them and should not be ""the monopoly of one company.""
The global Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees internet addresses, has extended until this month a deadline for the parties to reach a deal. 
""As a compromise solution for the 'dot Amazon' issue, we proposed our participation in the governance of this digital territory, with a view to safeguarding and promoting the natural, cultural and symbolic heritage of the Amazon region on the Internet,"" Brazil's deputy Foreign Minister Otavio Brandelli proposed on Wednesday.
""This would be an innovative mechanism, setting a positive precedent of public-private partnership in the development of internet governance,"" he said in a statement to Reuters, without explaining how it would work.
He said the proposal would give Amazon.com the chance to show Amazon countries and public opinion that it is ""a fully responsible corporation, capable of reconciling commercial interest with values cherished by its customers.""
ICANN placed Amazon.com's request on a ""Will not proceed"" footing in 2013, but an independent review process sought by the company faulted that decision and ICANN then told the Amazon basin nations they had to reach an agreement with the company.

1545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:50PM ET</span>",The Big Trading Dichotomy as Samsung Readies to Report Results,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a big divide of opinions on what’s next for Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.
As the world’s largest memory chipmaker gets ready to release quarterly results, questions about the timing of an industry recovery and a market rumor that one of its products is flawed have been circling around. Along with an unusual profit warning last week, that’s hurting sentiment. At the same time, Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).’s plan to cut output has lifted some spirits.
That’s led to a dichotomy: Foreign investors have bought 576 billion won ($508 million) of Samsung shares since Micron’s announcement two weeks ago, making it the most-purchased stock on South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index. On the other hand, local institutional and retail investors have both gone for the exit as analysts trimmed their estimates, projecting a drop in operating profit to 6.9 trillion won for the first quarter, which would be the worst since 2016. The company is expected to release preliminary results Friday.
“Foreign investors believe markets will be eventually normalized, with a supply control by makers that will adjust inventory,” said Shawn Oh, an equity trader at NH Investment & Securities who communicates with overseas investors. “Locals are still staying a bit on the pessimistic side on the near-term outlook.”
Samsung has rebounded 20 percent this year, almost completely erasing its 2018 plunge. That’s partly on hopes that the market for memory chips will recover as exports of Korean semiconductors jumped last month from a two-year low. Recent Chinese factory data also boosted optimism that the global economic slowdown may not be that bad, a positive for exporters such as Samsung, according to Yoon Joon-won, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management.
“Everyone is discussing when the industry hits its bottom,” Yoon said. “Memory-chip prices could probably fall again in the second quarter, but if the decline is within our acceptable ranges, we may be able to hope for a rebound in the industry. Micron’s comment is changing the atmosphere.”
Views are split on the future of the industry. Firms from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) say the downturn is likely to continue amid high inventory and weak chip sales. For DRAM, a chip memory popular in smartphones, DRAMeXchange expects prices to fall 15 percent in the second quarter and 10 percent in the third. On the other hand, Subin Lee, an analyst at Daishin Securities, says memory-chip prices may rebound in the second half of the year as data centers resume their purchases.
Aside from memory-chip woes, Samsung has been struggling to stem a decline in its smartphone sales as consumers wait longer to upgrade their devices. And its display division, which supplies Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., was hurt by lower-than-expected iPhone sales.
Then the rumor that a defect was found in one of Samsung’s main products hit -- some expect the company may confirm it, and now questions are arising about the potential impact. Costs related to the allegation may be spread or expensed evenly as allowance for bad debt, Peter Lee, an analyst at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets, wrote in a note.
While the stock has rebounded and foreigners are buying, even if demand picks up, it’s hard to believe there’ll be another so-called “supercycle” similar to the one that buoyed Samsung shares in the past, according to Jung Sang-jin, head of equities at Korea Investment Management.
“The supercycle of the chip industry is still in our memories,” he said, adding he’s now betting on stocks tied to domestic consumption. “Even if the demand rises and Samsung’s profits improve to probably up to 10 trillion won in operating profit, that wouldn’t surprise us that much -- unless there’s 20 trillion won or 30 trillion won of profit.”

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:42PM ET</span>",Shorts line up for a Lyft ride despite surge pricing,"By Sinéad Carew and Lance Tupper
NEW YORK (Reuters) - What a difference a week makes.  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) has gone from IPO darling to short sellers' best friend.
Investors have ramped up bets against Lyft, which went public in an IPO priced on Thursday at the top of its already-elevated target range, even as borrowing fees became the most expensive in the market for shares in the ride-hailing service.
More than 38 percent of Lyft's 32.5 million publicly listed shares, valued at $856 million, were sold short by the end of Tuesday's session, according to data from S3 Partners. S3 did not disclose Wednesday's levels. Lyft raised $2.34 billion in its IPO.
In comparison, short-selling in  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which was famously popular among shorts after its 2017 market debut, did not exceed 20 percent of its float until 10 weeks after its initial public offering. 
After rising as much as 23% on Friday in its first trading day, Lyft finished up 8.7 percent. Ahead of the offering, Lyft, which has warned it may never be profitable, had faced criticism for its dual-class share structure and its strategy for autonomous driving. Investor worries also include new laws aimed at increasing driver pay.
On Monday, Lyft's second trading day, the stock opened lower and quickly lost ground, ending down 11.9 percent and below its $72 per share IPO price. 
""The shorting started on Friday, but once the stock dropped 10% in the first 15 minutes of trading on Monday, it became a momentum and technical short because it was such a quick and savage move,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. 
Investors who sell securities short borrow shares and then sell them, in a bet that the stock price will fall, allowing them to buy the shares back at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
Tuesday was the first day short sellers could borrow shares in Lyft, the same day the company received its first ""sell"" rating from Wall Street.
By Tuesday's close, the cost of borrowing Lyft stock had risen to 101.4 percent of the amount borrowed on an annualized basis, according to S3. 
With a 39.9 percent borrow cost, MiMedx Group boasted the second biggest borrow fee for U.S. stocks with more than $50 million sold short, according to S3.
By Wednesday afternoon, borrowing fees for Lyft shares had more than halved, but it was the most expensive stock to short in that group. 
Lyft's initial short interest outshone that of another recent market debutant, Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), which went public on March 21. Short interest in Levi grew steadily for several days after the IPO but never reached the same level as Lyft's. By April 2 about 2.4 percent of Levi shares were sold short.
About 6.61 million Lyft shares with a market value of $455 million were reported as on-loan on Tuesday, according to IHS Markit Securities Finance issued on Wednesday. That firm sees borrowed shares as the best proxy for short selling.
""For Lyft to have that many shares on loan with that fee is notable,"" IHS Markit analyst Sam Pierson said. ""For an IPO there's a lot of demand up front, but even within that framework this is fairly high.""
Still, short sellers did not appear to be the dominant force on Wednesday. The stock closed at $70, after earlier touching its $72 IPO price. It remained well below $88.60, its highest price so far, which it hit during Friday's session.
Lyft shares pared gains on Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that billionaire investor Carl Icahn sold his roughly 2.7 percent stake in Lyft ahead of the IPO.

Of the eight analysts who cover Lyft, three recommend buying the stock while four say to hold it, and one has a sell rating. The median price target for the stock is $77.50, a range of $42 to $97, according to Refinitiv data.

1547,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Expected to Rise
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) jobs numbers were lower than expected today and tomorrow the market will get its weekly jobless claims update. All that leads up to the big employment report on Friday.
The Labor Department will report the latest claims figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen to 216,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Also on the labor front, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas will release its figures on March job cuts.
2. Natural Gas Stockpiles Seen Falling
Natural gas inventories are likely to garner attention in the energy complex Thursday when the Energy Information Administration is expected to report gas storage decreased by about 40 billion cubic feet.
April futures fell 0.14% to $2.67 on Wednesday and have been range-trading in recent sessions as weather-related price action tends to cool off in April, which brings an end to the heating season.
Natural gas prices have struggled to capitalize on the ongoing draw in supplies, which fell to the lowest level since 2014 in March, as production has remained elevated thanks to the U.S. shale oil revolution.
The EIA reported last month that natural gas production in the United States grew by 10 billion cubic feet per day during 2018, an 11% increase compared to the previous year.
Export-led demand has also played a factor in the uptick in production. Exports rose at an annual rate of about 20% to a record of 363 billion cubic feet in January.
Natural Gas futures are down 0.7% over the past year.
3. Corona Brewer Results on Tap

On average, analysts expect that the company earned $1.72 per share on sales of about $1.7 billion.
The stock is well below its 52-week high of more than $236, as its core beverage business has struggled at the same time the company continues to boost its investment in cannabis company  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC).
Constellation said after the bell it plans to shed about 30 of its low-end wine and spirits brands for $1.7 billion.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",Corona maker Constellation to sell about 30 brands for $1.7 billion,"(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) said on Wednesday it would sell about 30 of its low-end wine and spirits brands to E. & J. Gallo Winery for $1.7 billion, as the Corona beer maker focuses on more profitable brands.
In early February, the brewer said it was looking to sell some of its low-end wine brands, as it doubles down on more profitable high-end segment and shift towards beer and cannabis products that target a younger demographic.
The deal primarily includes Constellation's brands priced at or below $11 a bottle such as Clos du Bois, Ravenswood and Mark West and the related facilities. The company expects the deal to close at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Constellation, which is set to report quarterly results on Thursday, retains a host of brands including Robert Mondavi, Meiomi and Kim Crawford.

In 2016, the company divested its Canadian wine business to Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for about C$1.03 billion ($772 million).

1549,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",SoftBank to Seek $15 Billion More for Its Huge Tech Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- For SoftBank Group Corp., $100 billion isn’t enough. The Japanese conglomerate, which has reshaped the technology startup landscape with its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, is in talks with investors to add as much as $15 billion more to its already-massive fund, said people familiar with the discussions.
In about two years, the Vision Fund has invested more than $70 billion in tech companies. SoftBank wants to keep up its deal spree, while leaving enough assets in reserve to continue buying shares in companies it currently backs. Later, it plans to undergo an even more ambitious effort to assemble a second Vision Fund, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.
SoftBank has weighed a variety of ways to pump more cash into the original Vision Fund. Proposals include raising more capital, persuading state-backed investors in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi to waive their rights to debt repayments or taking out more bank loans, said the people. Terms of the fundraising have yet to be finalized, and there’s no certainty a deal will come together, one of the people said.
Spokesmen for the Vision Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. declined to comment. Representatives for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The Vision Fund has been writing huge checks at a rapid rate since raising the bulk of the fund in 2017. SoftBank has signed dozens of deals with startups involved in cancer detection, construction, dog walking, indoor farming, ride-hailing, satellites and window glass. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has said he intends to raise a new $100 billion fund every two or three years.
For a while, SoftBank appeared to have a long-term partner in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and chairman of the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, told Bloomberg in October that he would pledge another $45 billion to the next Vision Fund. Then the crown prince came under fire over accusations that he ordered the assassination of a Washington Post journalist. He denied prior knowledge and blamed the killing on Saudi security operatives who had gone rogue.
Amid international scrutiny of Prince Mohammed, the relationship with SoftBank and its biggest Middle Eastern investors showed signs of fraying. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that representatives of the Saudi and Abu Dhabi funds voiced concerns over the high prices the Vision Fund was paying for tech stocks.
Son had been holding preliminary discussions with investors last year about backing a second fund that could be established as soon as this year. The new fund would likely draw a wider pool of financiers.
SoftBank is seemingly in a more favorable negotiating position now. The stock is up about 50 percent this year. Although the debut of the second fund isn’t expected imminently, executives from SoftBank have been meeting over recent months with a range of investors -- some of whom backed the original Vision Fund and others who didn’t -- with attempts to nail down commitments, people familiar with the talks now say.
One stopgap to keep the money flowing came last month, when the Vision Fund secured a $3 billion loan from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and other banks. SoftBank executives have since renewed talks with banks to potentially take on even more debt for the Vision Fund, said people familiar with the discussions.
Another idea currently under consideration would enable the fund to reinvest some of the $5.6 billion profit it has made from investments in Nvidia Corp. and Flipkart, said the people. Or they might wait until Uber Technologies Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc. go public in the coming months and include a piece of those profits, one of the people said. Either scenario would require investors to approve changes to their contracts, which is no small feat.
A third scenario relies predominantly on the fund’s backers in the Middle East. SoftBank is asking investors to consider giving up the $3 billion a year they demanded in exchange for $40.6 billion in a preferred equity loan to the fund, the people said. Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi hold the vast majority of that stock.

1552,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Closes Higher on Trade Deal Hopes, Surge in Semis","Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed higher on Wednesday as optimism on trade and surging chip stocks helped offset falling energy stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15%, the S&P 500 added 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.60%.
The U.S.-China trade talks are at the “endgame stage,” said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Ninety percent of the deal is done, but the last 10% is the hardest part, it’s the trickiest part, and it will require trade-offs on both sides.”
The cautiously optimistic remarks come as China’s Vice Premier Liu He got his meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underway on Wednesday, resuming talks that took place in Beijing a week ago.
Despite optimism on U.S.-China trade riding high, trade-sensitive industrials struggled to close above the flatline for the day, pressured by a slump in defense companies.
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) fell 4.5%,  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) fell 2.4%, and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) fell 1.92%.
Beyond trade, falling energy stocks kept a lid on gains in the broader market as oil prices fell following an unexpected build in U.S. crude supplies.
But a surge in tech stocks propped up sentiment on risk following a surge in chip stocks, led by Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), up 8.5%.
Nomura talked up the prospect of higher profits for AMD on expectations that weakness in chip markets will bottom out in the first quarter thanks to an improving economic backdrop in China, which accounts for a large proportion of global spending on chips.
Elsewhere in tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed 0.7% higher despite Nomura pouring cold water on expectations that the company's services revenue would offset slower iPhone sales sooner rather than later.
App Store growth slowed to 15% in the March quarter from 18% in the December quarter, according to Sensor Tower, Nomura said. The price cut in iPhones are doing little to lift demand for the company's flagship smartphones amid ongoing softness in the China smartphone market, the bank added.
In consumer discretionary, GameStop (NYSE:GME) played its way into trouble, falling 4.7% after its guidance on full-year earnings fell short of Wall Street consensus estimates.
Following the dour guidance, Morgan Stanley highlighted declining trade-ins of older games as a headwind on GameStop's used-game sales and gross margin.
""Indeed, there seems to be a widening gap between new and used trends, and we are concerned that fewer trade-ins hurt other parts of the business as well,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Economic data offered little to spur a rally in stocks as the private sector created fewer jobs than expected, and the services activity undershot economists' forecasts, pointing to further signs of a slowdown in the economy.

""The software update worked as designed, and the pilots landed safely at Boeing Field (near Seattle),"" it said in a statement.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",U.S. agency drops plan to adopt international vehicle window safety standards,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Wednesday it was dropping a 2012 proposal to harmonize U.S. vehicle window safety standards with international rules.
Under the Obama administration, the auto safety agency known as NHTSA proposed adopting international rules on glazing materials agreed to by a world forum in 2004.
But NHTSA said it was now withdrawing the proposal because it could not conclude that harmonizing the rules ""would increase safety.""
The agency cited crash data that suggests ""current glazing materials are performing acceptably."" The rules were previously adopted by the European Union.
The United States already has performance requirements in place for car windows to reduce injuries resulting from impact, ensure transparency for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through windows in collisions.
NHTSA said safety issues around glazing had been substantially reduced since the 1960s, adding that it still planned to conduct additional glazing research.
In 2012, NHTSA said adopting the international rules would modernize U.S. testing to account for ""tempered glass, laminated glass, and glass-plastic glazing used in front and rear windshields and side windows"" and would ""better reflect real world conditions and eliminate redundant and unnecessary testing.""
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that represents major automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, said in August 2012 it supported NHTSA's efforts to harmonize regulations.

""Differences, even small ones, in functionally equivalent regulations cause redundancy that adds cost to the product without benefit for the consumer,"" the group wrote.

1555,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>","While Dividend Seems Safe, Walgreens Faces Big Challenges","By Charley Blaine
Investing.com - The best you can say about Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) now is that the dividend of $1.76 a year is safe.
Everything else is uncertain, especially after Walgreens' earnings on Tuesday, which even CEO Stefano Pissena called ""very disappointing"" during the company's analyst call. The prospects are ugly enough that the company cut its fiscal 2019 guidance for 7% to 12% earnings growth on a constant currency basis to flat.
The stock fell 13% on Tuesday and fell below $55 on Wednesday for the first time since 2013. It is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, down more than 19%, and off more than 35% from its 52-week high reached last fall.
After the call, a number of analysts cut price targets on the stock into the low $60s. Technical indicators on Investing.com rate the stock a strong sell.
Sales are getting pressured just about everywhere, but the biggest issue is the U.S. pharmacy business. Insurance companies and government agencies are driving down reimbursement levels. So, while Walgreens is filling more prescriptions (and will be as the population ages), its profit from each sale is shrinking.
Business in the front of its pharmacies is getting hurt, too, in part because old reliables aren't so reliable. This year's flu season wasn't nearly as bad as 2018, cutting into sales of cough, flu and cold medicine. Plus, tobacco sales are lower, in part because Walgreens is getting out of the business.
Its Boots business, which operates pharmacies across of much of Europe, is showing poor results, at least in dollars, as the dollar rises and the pound and euro slip. Plus, European economies aren't doing all that well.
Competitors are doing wild and crazy things. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) went out and bought health insurance company Aetna (NYSE:AET) for $68 billion.
The analyst call was more notable for what wasn't really addressed.
First, no analyst raised the issue of whether Medicare-for-all might actually happen. CFO James Kehoe noted that the company is implementing $1.5 billion in annual cost cuts and a massive move into digitizing everything. Then, he said, ""Over the long term, we are comfortable that our growth model can deliver mid- to high-single digit adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies.""
So, for Walgreens the issue is dealing with what appear to be incremental issues posed by any changes to healthcare laws.
This second issue is larger.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (formed in 2014 when Walgreens bought the 45% of Alliance Boots it didn't own) is now a sprawling operation. It has a presence in more than 25 countries, either wholly or through investments or franchises, and counts more than 415,000 employees. While the U.S. is the largest piece portion of that business, it's still hard to juggle when things don't match up country to country.
At least the dividend is not really pressuring operations. It represents about 28% of cash flow. And there's enough cash flowing through the business that the company expects to buy back $1.7 billion in shares each year over the next three, which helps boost reported earnings per share.
Its consistency suggests that the company has the financial strength to fix the business, at least for now."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Wednesday, extending a strong start to the quarter as rising hopes of a trade deal with Beijing boosted investor sentiment.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said that talks between the United States and China have progressed and that both sides hope to get closer to a deal this week.
Shares of chipmakers, which are heavily reliant on China for their revenue, especially benefited. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped as much as 3% to a record high. The index was last 2.4% higher.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc shares gained 9.3%, the most on the S&P 500, and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) shares rose 2.0% after Nomura Instinet started coverage of both the stocks with ""buy"" ratings.
The positive sentiment on trade outweighed underwhelming economic data.
The Institute for Supply Management came out with its U.S. services sector PMI for March, which was below estimates and at its lowest since August 2017.
Earlier, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers added 129,000 jobs in March, below economists' estimates.
""It's the push-and-pull hope of a trade deal versus the stark reality of disappointing economic news,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.37 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,192.5, the S&P 500 gained 4.52 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,871.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.12 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,893.80.
The gains put the S&P 500 index just 2% below a record high in September as a dovish Federal Reserve and trade hopes set the stage for a strong start to the quarter.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co capped gains on the Dow, dropping 1.3% after Baird said it expects Wall Street to cut earnings estimates ""considerably"" after the company reports delivery numbers next week. The numbers could reflect the 737-MAX groundings following the Ethiopian crash, Baird said.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 28 new lows.

AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to unveil its third-generation Ryzen series CPUs, with the new Zen 2 architecture and the corresponding X570 chipsets, at Computex in late May, DigiTimes reported. The chipmaker's shares rose 9%.
The new Rome server CPUs will start shipping towards the middle of the year and the next-gen Navi GPUs will launch in the third quarter.
The launch of the new chips comes as AMD has been winning new business at the expense of rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has suffered from CPU shortages, the report said.
Many motherboard manufacturers have increased the shipment proportion of their AMD 500 series-based motherboards, attracted by the price and performance of AMD's Ryzen 3000 processors, the report noted.
The report underscored Nomura's bullish call on the chipmaker issued a day earlier.
""We think a return to sustainable profitability will help drive Advanced Micro Device’s stock value,"" analyst David Wong wrote to clients. ""We forecast AMD’s reported GAAP EPS will climb through 2019 and rise meaningfully in subsequent years from roughly breakeven in the March 2019 quarter.""
Nomura initiated coverage on AMD with a buy rating and $33 price target.
In recent weeks, the analyst community has turned more positive on chipmakers, betting that the weakness would bottom out in the first quarter amid expectations that a rebound in the Chinese economy will boost spending on chips.

The latest round of funding boosts the consumer lending company's total financing to about $800 million, the company said in a statement. 
Affirm was valued at $2.9 billion in the latest funding round, financial news website Axios said, citing sources. Reuters could not independently confirm the valuation.
The company plans to use the funds for hiring and expansion.
Fidelity Management and Research, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Scottish fund Baillie Gifford were among its other investors.
Levchin started Affirm in 2013 to give consumers without credit history or savings accounts access to small loans. The startup offers financing for online purchases, such as a couch or guitar, which is paid back in monthly installments.

For Levchin, Affirm is something of a PayPal 2.0, using big data analytics and highly complex security systems to offer consumers an alternative to traditional banks.

The plant in the town of Esipovo 40 kilometers north west of Moscow is the first in years to be opened by a foreign carmaker in Russia where investment into the once burgeoning auto industry dried up amid western sanctions and a stagnant economy. 
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Putin said the plant would produce 25,000 cars a year and that investment in the project had totaled 19 billion roubles ($291 million). 
Putin said the factory, built after Daimler signed a deal with Russia's authorities in early 2017, would employ almost 1,000 people. 

Most global automakers opened plants in Russia in the first half of the 2000s, but after peaking in 2012 car sales slumped to a ten-year low of 1.42 million in 2016. The market is picking up again, and a total of 1.8 million cars were sold last year.

China - embroiled in a major diplomatic dispute with Ottawa - has blocked imports from two major Canadian exporters and on Tuesday Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said a third company had received a Chinese notice of non-compliance. 
""It was a misunderstanding ... in January, three Canadian companies received notices of non-compliance regarding shipments of canola seed from Canada to China,"" said the official.
""In March, China suspended the registration of two of the companies. They have not suspended the registration of the third company ... it is nothing new and there has been no escalation,"" said the official, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation.
Early last month, China cited the discovery of pests as the reason for blocking shipments of canola seed from Richardson International. Shortly afterward, it expanded the ban to a second major exporter, Viterra Inc.

China accounts for about 40 percent of Canada's canola seed, oil and meal exports, according to the Canola Council, with seed exports to China worth some C$2.7 billion ($2 billion) a year.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",German lawmakers ready to block public cash for Deutsche-Commerzbank,"By John O'Donnell
BERLIN (Reuters) - Lawmakers are warning Germany's finance minister that they will block any attempt to invest public money into a merged  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), a deal which could require up to 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) of fresh capital.
They intend to deliver this message at a closed-door meeting next week with Olaf Scholz, although it is unclear whether the Social Democrat finance minister still plans to attend.
""The merged bank will probably need fresh capital. One thing that we will not stand for is that the state gives more money,"" said Bettina Stark-Watzinger, who chairs the Bundestag's finance committee, emphasizing a hurdle to any deal.
Deutsche Bank's exploratory merger talks with state-backed Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany's finance ministry, which is worried about the future of the country's biggest bank.
A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group, which one German official said will need up to 10 billion euros of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up. 
While German parliamentarians cannot stop the merger itself, they are warning that the Bundestag can block any fresh money to fill a capital shortfall, a crucial pillar to any deal.
""This goes contrary to one of the lessons of the financial crisis – that the taxpayer should not foot the bill for troubled banks,"" Stark-Watzinger said.
A spokesman for Scholz, who was the first to publicly reveal the merger talks but has since sought to distance himself from the process, insisting it is up to the banks to decide on their future, declined to comment, as did Deutsche Bank.
""UNTHINKABLE""
Lothar Binding, a leading Social Democrat on the committee, also said the government needed approval from the Bundestag if it wanted to back the merged group with fresh funds. 
This would not be triggered if Germany's 15 percent Commerzbank stake automatically translates into a roughly 5 percent stake in the merged group, but approval is needed if the bank asks investors for fresh money, as expected.
""As things stand, it is unthinkable that the Bundestag would agree,"" said Binding. ""Any synergies in this deal would come at an immensely high price: huge unemployment. 25,000 to 30,000 jobs could go. I'm against a merger.""
Some conservatives are similarly opposed to the deal. 
""We need competition in the banking market, not mega mergers,"" said Hans Michelbach, a lawmaker from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. 
""How on earth can we sell a merger with this bank to our voters? I won't support it under any circumstances.""
Frustration has been growing in parliament because lawmakers believe Scholz is ignoring their concerns.
Through its stake in Commerzbank, the German government would become a top shareholder in a merged group, playing a central role in any fusion. Lawmakers fear this puts it on the hook to shoulder losses if the bank later runs into trouble.
Berlin could yet pull the plug if it believes a deal would be politically unpalatable.
""This merger is rubbish. It will cost not only jobs but hard cash as well,"" said Lisa Paus, a Green party member of parliament, adding that she would reject any government participation in a capital hike. 

""It is a running joke in parliament: 'Where is Scholz?', she said, adding that his failure to explain the merits of a merger had infuriated many lawmakers. ""He doesn't speak to us.""

The announcement https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm635157.htm comes at a time when the regulator is aiming to curb the surge in teenage use of the popular nicotine devices, which the FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, due to leave the agency this month, has termed as an ""epidemic"".
The agency said it had observed a slight increase in the reports of seizures since last June and has identified 35 cases of seizures following use of e-cigarettes between 2010 and early 2019. The seizures, which mostly involved youth or young adult users, had occurred after a few puffs or up to one day after use. 
E-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community, with some focusing on the benefit of shifting smokers to less harmful nicotine products, while others fear it would create a new generation addicted to nicotine.
Seizures or convulsions are known potential side effects of nicotine poisoning and have been reported in relation to intentional or accidental swallowing of nicotine-containing e-liquids, according to the FDA statement.
However, the agency said it could not yet say for certain that e-cigarettes had caused the seizures and the cases warrant an investigation into whether there is in fact a connection.
Last month, the FDA had released formal plans to curb the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, which involve restricting the availability of flavors other than tobacco, mint and menthol, to stores or online portals where strong age-verification protocols are in place.
The agency on Wednesday said that it was also looking into any additional consequences to nicotine use as some e-cigarettes deliver high concentrations of nicotine.
The FDA said many of the reports it had received lacked enough information to identify a specific brand or sub-brand of e-cigarettes.

Some of the reported seizure cases involved users who had a prior history of seizure diagnosis, while a few others suffered seizures in association with use of other substances such as marijuana or amphetamines.

1578,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",U.S.-Mexico Border Closing Would Shut Carmarkers and Cripple Farm Goods,"(Bloomberg) -- Go inside the global economy with Stephanie Flanders in her new podcast, Stephanomics. Sign up here.
U.S. auto production would grind to a halt in a week, while pork producers and dairy farmers would be shut out of their largest export market. Grocery shoppers would quickly face shortages of avocados, tomatoes and other produce or steep price increases as supplies plummet.
President Donald Trump has been short on details about his threat to close the border with Mexico to cut off illegal immigration, and even inside the White House aides are unsure how -- or even if -- he’ll follow through. But any move that would shut down or hinder $1.7 billion in daily cross-border trade would have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. economy.
Amid warnings from his Republican allies and his advisers, Trump on Tuesday dialed back somewhat from his threat by tweet last week to shut the border if Mexico didn’t stop the flow of Central Americans heading north. He suggested the U.S. could “close large sections of the border, maybe not all of it.”
But he also made clear the idea of a broader action isn’t off the table.
“Let me just give you a little secret: security is more important to me than trade,” Trump said at the White House. “I’m totally prepared to do it. We’re going to see what happens over the next few days.”
Supply Chains
Analysts said a border closing would rapidly reverberate through a U.S. economy in which supply chains are closely integrated with Mexico, especially hitting the auto industry and farmers already reeling from the impact of Trump’s trade war with China. Avocado prices have already spiked.
“You can’t build an auto without all the parts,” said Kristin Dziczek, a vice president of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. “Within a shift or two we would start to see some parts shortages, and some of those parts are so mission critical we would see the entire industry shut down within a week or so.”
A typical vehicle is assembled from 30,000 parts and Mexico is the largest source of foreign components for U.S. manufacturers, who have geared their production to lean inventories and just-in-time delivery. Seats, for example, often go back and forth across the border several times as they are produced in stages, said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist with Cox Automotive Inc., an Atlanta-based research and marketing company.
“I don’t see how the industry can react in any way,” Chesbrough said. “You need very specific parts to go into a vehicle.”
Auto Parts
Even if the administration decides to exempt auto parts from a border closing, that would be difficult to do in practice, Dziczek said. Late Tuesday, Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was considering ways to limit damage, telling CNBC one idea might be to find ways to allow freight across the border to “ameliorate the breakdown in supply chains.”
For American farmers and grocery shoppers, a border closing “would be disruptive really quickly,” said Veronica Nigh, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Mexico supplies more than 60 percent of all fresh produce sold in the U.S. during the winter and early spring, said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, a trade association that represents importers and distributors of Mexican produce.
Price Surges
American shoppers would see an immediate price surges and then virtual disappearance from supermarkets of tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, squash, eggplant, green beens, mangoes, melons, berries and chili peppers, Jungmeyer said.
Trump’s threat already has driven up the wholesale price of Hass Avocados in Mexico City by 34 percent since Monday, the biggest one-day gain in a decade. Mexican avocados account for 75 percent to 80 percent of U.S. consumption, according to the Hass avocado board.
Mexico also is the third-largest export market for U.S. agriculture and the largest for corn, pork and dairy products, according to the U.S. trade representative. It is also the largest foreign source of food for Americans.
Trump’s Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressed concern a border shutdown would hurt U.S. Farmers.
“It’s not helpful,” Perdue said during a visit to Purdue University in Indiana that was recorded by the department. “I would like to see certainly it not affect agricultural trade in that regard, whether it’s rail or truck, but that may be wishing for too much.”
Sixty-nine percent of agricultural trade travels across the border by truck, Nigh said, including virtually all U.S pork and dairy exports to Mexico.
“If we lose the market, it would be catastrophic,” said Jim Monroe, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council. “We’re a highly export-dependent industry.”
Farm Income
Five new pork packing plants opened in the U.S. in last few years, only to have export markets contract because of the trade wars, Monroe said.
“It could not come at a worse time,” Monroe said. “We’ve already seen a significant drop in producer profitability because of tariff disputes.”
Tom Vilsack, a former U.S. agriculture secretary who is now president of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, said in a statement that closing the border “would be a gut punch that could set the industry back by a decade or two.""
“There is not a ready alternative market for the millions of gallons of milk that are converted into the thousands of tons of dairy ingredients and cheese we ship to Mexico,” Vilsack said.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday the president hasn’t set a timeline for action. The president left himself an opening to retreat by saying Mexico has stepped up apprehensions at its southern border “as of yesterday.”
“Let’s see if they keep it done -- if -- if they keep doing that,” Trump said.
Consternation in Congress
Still, Trump’s threat, and the way he made it, caused consternation among Republicans in Congress and drew derision from Democrats.
“Closing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country, and we would hope he would not be doing that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, indicated the administration hasn’t given Congress any insights.“I’m not quite sure what he means by closing the border,” Johnson said.
South Dakota’s John Thune, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, called closing the border a “bad idea” and expressed some frustration with Trump’s lack of consultations.
“Obviously this is a president who sometimes tends to move on his own and then have some of those conversations later,” Thune said. “That’s the dynamic everybody here deals with.”
But Senate Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump ally, said he’s ""all for"" closing the border if it will ""compel Congress to fix the underlying problem.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking at an event in Washington Tuesday, dismissed Trump’s threat to shut down the border as “an applause line, not an idea.”"
1579,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 10:34AM ET</span>",Ghosn tweets about telling the truth as report says prosecutors readying new case,"By Kenneth Maxwell and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn promised to ""tell the truth"" at a news conference next week, taking to Twitter to announce his first briefing since being released on bail and hours after a report that prosecutors were preparing a fresh case against him.
Ghosn, widely lauded for rescuing Nissan Motor Co from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago, has experienced a dramatic fall from grace that shook the global auto industry and raised questions about the future of Nissan's alliance with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
He was arrested in Tokyo in November and faces charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust over allegedly failing to report around $82 million in salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the financial crisis.
Released on $9 million bail last month, Ghosn has denied the charges, calling them ""meritless"" and saying he was the victim of a boardroom coup.
""I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11,"" Ghosn tweeted from the @carlosghosn account on Twitter, which displayed the blue tick mark indicating it had been verified by the social media site.
The account was created this month. It was the sole tweet, posted in Japanese and English.
While Ghosn is under strict bail terms - including on internet usage - his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters the tweet did not violate those terms.
Hironaka also said there had been no requests from Tokyo prosecutors, after Japan's Yomiuri newspaper and other media outlets reported authorities were preparing a fresh case against Ghosn over payments the automaker made to a business partner in Oman.
FRESH CHARGES?
Prosecutors are in discussions with the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and others and plan to make a decision soon on whether to prosecute Ghosn on further charges of aggravated breach of trust, the newspaper said, citing sources involved in the case.
A spokesman for the Tokyo prosecutors office said he was not aware of any new investigation when contacted by Reuters. 
Ghosn's spokesman has previously said payments of $32 million made over nine years were rewards for the Oman firm being a top Nissan dealer. Such dealer incentives were not directed by Ghosn and the funds were not used to pay any personal debt, the spokesman said.
Sources told Reuters earlier this week that Renault had alerted French prosecutors after uncovering suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was chief executive of the French automaker.
Nissan had previously established its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Oman distributor, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA). 
Evidence sent to French prosecutors late last week showed that much of the cash was subsequently channeled to a Lebanese company controlled by Ghosn associates, the sources said.

Reuters has not been able to reach SBA for comment on the matter.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) moved to scrap former chef executive Carlos Ghosn's 765,000 euro ($859,000) annual pension, people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, as the French carmaker is drawn deeper into the financial misconduct scandal engulfing its alliance with Nissan.
Renault, which last week alerted prosecutors to millions of euros in suspect payments by its Middle Eastern sales arm, also proposed to dock part of the ousted alliance boss's 2018 pay at a board meeting on Wednesday, two sources said.
A Renault spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing.
Ghosn, who is facing trial in Japan, was forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January, when he notified the board in his resignation letter that he was entitled to draw his pension, said one of the people close to Renault.
""But his lawyers got it wrong,"" the source said after Wednesday's board meeting.
Directors also recommended that shareholders block 224,000 euros in Ghosn's variable pay for 2018, and approved governance changes reducing the size of the board to 18 members from 20 upon his formal departure as a member, the sources said.
Long-serving director Philippe Lagayette and Cherie Blair, the wife of British former prime minister Tony Blair, are both also stepping down from the Renault board in June.

The carmaker earlier axed 30 million euros in deferred and severance pay to Ghosn in the wake of his November arrest and indictment on charges including failure to declare $82 million in Nissan pay he had arranged to receive after retirement.

(Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, the world largest alternative asset manager, has so far raised over $22 billion for its latest flagship private equity buyout fund, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The New York-based firm, led by cofounder Steve Schwarzman, expects to conclude the fundraising later this year for its eighth buyout fund, said the source, requesting anonymity as the details are private. 
Blackstone does not have a firm target in mind but it anticipates the fund will be the largest ever of its kind, overtaking the $24.6-billion fund raised by Apollo Global Management in 2017, the source added. 
Blackstone President Jon Gray had said in January the firm expected the fund to exceed $20 billion in size. 
A spokeswoman declined to comment on the fundraising, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg. 
Blackstone, which had $44.4 billion in private equity funds it had raised but yet to invest at the end of 2018, has been pursuing several large leveraged buyouts in recent years. 
Last year, it purchased a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent company of Reuters News, in a $20-billion deal. 
Among its purchases so far in 2019, it has partnered with Hellman & Friedman to acquire human resources applications provider Ultimate Software Group Inc in an $11 billion buyout and for the acquisition of German online listings company Scout24 AG. 
At the end of 2018, Blackstone had $472.2 billion in total assets under management. 
The fundraising also comes as Brookfield is bulking up in size to rival Blackstone, last month agreeing to buy most of Oaktree Capital Management.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn's sudden appearance on Twitter on Wednesday was a surprise move by the businessman that perplexed people and sent journalists scrambling, and not for the first time. 
The first tweet from the @carlosghosn account on the social network at 12:51 p.m. (0351 GMT) read, ""I'm getting ready to tell the truth about what's happening. Press conference on Thursday, April 11."" 
It did not specify a time or place.
Featuring a photo of a smiling, grey-haired Ghosn standing in front of a tree with seasonal cherry blossoms, the account initially lacked the blue tick mark to show it had been verified by the social network. 
That left journalists unsure of its authenticity - particularly as the conditions of Ghosn's $9 million bail preclude him from using the internet.
Forty minutes later, when the blue tick appeared, the tweet swept across social media and the account's followers swelled to almost 20,000, from just a handful earlier. 
Some of the replies appeared sympathetic to Ghosn, with others carrying photos of his now-famous exit from a Tokyo detention center last month.
""Stood right alongside you with #GiveGhosnBail. Looking forward to hearing your side,"" wrote one Twitter user with the name @highmileage. 
Ghosn had also caught media off guard when he disguised himself in a workman's uniform, cap and face mask to try and give waiting reporters the slip on leaving the detention center after his release on bail. 
The architect of the Nissan and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) global alliance was then pursued by media as he rode away in a small work van, a Suzuki, topped with a ladder.
Ghosn's dramatic fall from grace began with his arrest in November after getting off a private plane at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. He has since been charged with financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust. 
On Wednesday, the Yomiuri newspaper said Tokyo prosecutors will soon decide whether to prosecute Ghosn on further charges. A further arrest could jeopardize the planned news conference. 

It remains unclear if Ghosn sent the tweet or it was sent on his behalf. His bail conditions allow him to access a computer at his lawyer's office but forbid him to use the internet.

Asset managers have become less willing to pay as much for stock-picking research following MiFID II, which unbundled fees. It has forced some brokers to scale back their coverage of small- and medium-sized (SME) companies.
""There are many companies that are no longer understood by capital markets. If value is no longer understood, that leads to imbalances - opening up opportunities for us,"" Triton Managing Partner Martin Huth said on Wednesday.
Private equity fund Triton specializes in SME investments in the Nordics and Germany.
In volatile markets, taking listed companies private was a possibility for Triton, Huth said, adding that potential targets Triton is currently looking at are smaller than the recently acquired $2.5 billion firm Ifco.
In January, Triton closed a 5 billion euro ($5.62 billion) fund, which is targeting companies with an enterprise value between 300 million and 2 billion euros, Huth said, adding that for larger deals Triton could work with other funds or its own fund investors.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and France's AMF have both said they are looking into the impact on the market of the MiFID II rules unbundling fees.

He will be replaced by Linda Findley Kozlowski, who was most recently the chief operating officer at Etsy.
""We are incredibly excited to have an executive of Linda's caliber as Blue Apron's next CEO,"" Matt Salzberg, the chairman of Blue Apron's board of directors, said.
""Linda’s exceptional leadership and marketing expertise, as well as her understanding of Blue Apron customers as a long-time customer herself, will help her advance the company towards sustainable, profitable growth,"" he added.
In addition to the departure of Dickerson, cofounder and chief technology officer Ilia Papas will also leave the company to pursue other opportunities.
Blue Apron reaffirmed its prior guidance of ""a significant improvement in net loss and achieving profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the first quarter of 2019 and for full year 2019.""
The meal-kit maker has had a difficult time as a publicly traded company since its June 2017 initial public offering. First, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced plans to buy Whole Foods, causing Blue Apron to slash its IPO range to between $10 and $11 a share, down from $15 to $17, as investors worried about the competition such a deal would bring. Then, less than a month later, Amazon rolled out its own meal-kit business. 
More recently, the company has had trouble holding onto customers. Last August, Blue Apron said its total number of customers plunged by 24% year-over-year in the second quarter and that revenue per customer was down by $1 to $250. At that time, the stock was trading near $2 a share.
And in December, Blue Apron tumbled to a low of $0.65 before a partnership with Weight Watchers ignited a rally to more than $1.60.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 08:35AM ET</span>","Santander focused on Europe cost cuts, Latin American profit","By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Santander (MC:SAN) assured investors on Wednesday that cost savings in mature markets in Europe and higher profitability growth in Latin America were enough to deliver on midterm financial targets while pushing its digital transformation.
Santander said it was aiming for incremental annual cost savings of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the medium term, of which 1 billion euros would come from Europe.
Europe's banks are focused on cost savings as they attempt to offset a squeeze on margins due to ongoing record-low interest rates in the euro zone.
Santander shares were up 2.1 percent at 116 GMT against a 1.4 percent rise on the European STOXX banking index.
As part of its focus on efficiency in Europe, it said it was expecting 250 million euros of additional cost savings in Spain from the integration of Popular to boost its underlying profitability to between 14-16 percent from around 11 percent.
When it first announced the acquisition of Popular in 2017, Santander said it was expecting cost synergies of close to 500 million euros per year from 2020.
In Britain, Santander's third biggest market, it said that as part of its strategy it would focus on cost management and continued risk discipline, without giving any specifics.
Of its main markets, Britain was the area with the lowest underlying profitability target ratio. It set out a target of between 10-12 percent from 9 percent in 2018.
Santander is expecting the British economy to grow around 1 percent over the next couple of years partially due to uncertainty over Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
""It could be better and it could be worse, but your guess is as good as mine. As to what's going to happen I'm a bit confused,"" Sandtander Chairman Ana Botin said when asked about the Brexit outcome. She stressed that the lender was taking a conservative approach toward lending in Britain.
Santander said around 730 million euros of the total cost savings would come from efficiency gains in IT and operations and 220 million euros from shared services across regions, including Britain.
The bank also said it was aiming to reach a cost-income ratio - a measure of efficiency - of between 42 percent and 45 percent at group level in the medium term from 47 percent.
Santander reiterated it was aiming to lift its return on tangible equity (ROTE), a measure of profitability, to 13-15 percent in the medium term from 11.7 percent in 2018.
LATIN AMERICA PROFITABILITY
In Brazil, the bank's biggest market, Santander said it was expecting low interest rates to maintain growth in its loan book and keep improving its underlying ROTE above 20 percent.
Its business in Latin America, responsible for 43 percent of the bank's profits, was seen rising its profitability to between 20-22 percent, thanks to high and sustainable revenue growth.
Santander also repeated a mid-term core Tier 1 capital ratio target of 11-12 percent, against 11.3 percent in 2018 but below the average of more than 12.5 percent among its European peers.
Botin dismissed analysts' concerns over the bank's capital adequacy, highlighting the lender's lower risk retail and higher diversification model.
""Being prudent, having more capital, we all want that but at some point enough is enough and if they keep on building buffers and buffers, Europe will not grow, banks in Europe will have increasing problems and they will have less inclination to lend,"" Botin told investors in London.
With banks facing increasing competition from so-called new technology entrants, Santander also unveiled a plan to expand its digital bank, Open Bank, to 10 new international markets in order to reach two million customers.

As part of its digital drive, Santander said it would invest over 20 billion euros in technology over the next four years.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 08:23AM ET</span>",Nordic trust tarnished by money laundering scandal,"By Johan Ahlander, Esha Vaish and John O'Donnell
STOCKHOLM/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Money laundering allegations involving Sweden and Denmark have shattered faith in the open Nordic business culture, prompting demands for tighter controls on the banks held responsible.
Ranked among the least corrupt countries by anti-graft campaign group Transparency International, Sweden and Denmark have been rocked by investigations into Danske Bank and Swedbank, knocking billions off their value.
Politicians, regulators and investors now want closer policing and more stringent penalties, unwinding a system where the state largely trusted banks to keep themselves in check.
""Openness is key in our society. This is a system built on trust and that trust has decreased quite substantially,"" Swedish financial markets minister Per Bolund told Reuters.
""It's not enough to fire one person,"" Bolund said of Swedbank's dismissal last week of Birgitte Bonnesen as chief executive, adding that an overhaul of its controls was needed, in a clear signal of future government action. 
""That has to go all the way from the top to the bottom.""
Sweden has yet to announce substantial reforms following the emergence of money laundering allegations against Swedbank which originated in Europe's Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia.
Latvia, a former Soviet state with a large Russian-speaking minority, had modeled itself as a financial bridge for Russians moving money to Europe. Similar profitable activity took place in Estonia, but has now become a reputational liability. 
Danske Bank has been ejected from Estonia after admitting 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious money movements flowed through its branch there between 2007 and 2015. And it is also pulling out of neighboring Baltic states.
Danish academic Gert Svendsen, author of 'Trust', says the scandals risk undermining a central tenet of Nordic culture. 
""People become happier if you can do things based on trust. That explains why Swedes and Danes are quite happy,"" he said.
WIDER WAVES 
The money laundering scandals, which have been growing week by week, are shaking politics as well as the boardroom.
In Denmark, which was first to be hit by Danske Bank, the scandal bolstered support for a left-wing opposition bloc that some polls suggest could oust the right-wing coalition in elections expected by June.
In response, the Danish government plans to create what one minister dubbed a ""more aggressive financial regulator"", doubling the officials fighting money laundering to 24, allowing it to fine banks for breaches or insert an observer on a board.
""In the case of Danske Bank, we've seen how authorities send letters back and forth for seven or eight years before it was stopped,"" Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov said, announcing the shift toward U.S.-style controls.
Sweden may follow suit, with prime minister Stefan Lofven last week saying he could ""strengthen legislation"" following criticism that regulators have been too lax.
Last year the management of Sweden's financial watchdog went against its own experts' recommendations that it should sanction several of the major bank for insufficient money-laundering controls, opting instead to send warning letters.
The FSA also had to tighten rules requiring banks to set aside more funds for home loan losses after the central bank said it was being too generous.
And Joacim Olsson, head of the Swedish Shareholders' Association has criticized it for being tough on smaller banks but softer on large ones. 
""We in Sweden as a whole, and other regulators, have done too little. That is the conclusion from Danske Bank,"" Swedish FSA head Erik Thedeen told reporters last month. 
Louise Brown of Transparency International said Sweden needed to reform, adding: ""We need to upgrade both regulatory execution and corporate governance"".
REGULATORY RELATIONS
The Danske Bank and Swedbank scandals have also raised questions about often close relationships between regulators and the banks the oversee.
Former Danish FSA chairman Henrik Ramlau-Hansen, who had served as finance chief at Danske Bank for five years before joining the FSA in 2016, stepped down in May last year.
Denmark now prohibits the chairman and deputy chairman to have worked at financial institutions for five years prior.
Sweden's FSA boss Thedeen had in previous roles worked with Swedbank's board member Peter Norman, although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing by either. 
The FSA has said that Thedeen earlier recused himself from the Swedbank investigation due to the conflict of interest, and that money laundering supervision, including the probe, were being handled by his deputy.
For some, such closeness is inevitable. ""Sweden is quite a small country,"" said Torbjorn Hallo, an economist at the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. ""Most people know each other.""
And some investors say it is time for change. 

""We have had some concerns about the Nordic model ... for some time. Often boards lack industry experience, and are instead pulled from a local pool,"" the head of corporate governance at one London fund manager said, adding that the management often goes unchallenged as a result.

Swedbank is embroiled in a money-laundering scandal involving Danske Bank, which revealed last year that its Estonian branch had been used to move 230 billion euros ($258 billion) of suspicious payments between 2007 and 2015.
Browder founded Hermitage Capital and was once the biggest foreign money manager in Russia. He has been instrumental in driving authorities to bring cases against Danske Bank.
""At the moment the prosecutor is analyzing the data, and the decision on whether to start an investigation will be made within 10 days,"" said the spokeswoman, who declined to comment on the content of the filing.

Earlier this week Sweden's Economic Crime Authority (EBM) dropped a complaint by Browder saying the limited transfers involving Swedish accounts had occurred before tighter anti-money laundering legislation was introduced in 2014 and as a statute of limitations had expired in the case.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 08:05AM ET</span>",Commerzbank stake sale would cost German taxpayers billions of euros,"By Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - German taxpayers would lose billions of euros if the state sold its stake in Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) ahead of a possible merger with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), a government document showed, highlighting the risks of government involvement in the sector.
Berlin owns 15.6 percent in Commerzbank after a bailout a decade ago, and lawmakers have called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz to get rid of the stake to avoid future risks for the budget if Commerzbank should merge with its larger rival.
Deutsche and Commerzbank said last month that they were in talks to merge.
In an answer to a parliamentary request seen by Reuters, the Finance Ministry said that the Commerzbank share price, or the price offered in any takeover deal, would have to be some 26 euros to avoid a loss for the state.
The Commerzbank shares are currently worth some 7 euros.
Lisa Paus, budget lawmaker of the opposition Greens, said the Finance Ministry's answers showed that the government's loss currently stands at 3.7 billion euros ($4.16 billion), though it is unrealized.
""The bailout of banks has cost German taxpayers enormous sums of money in the past. Whoever believes that this is over now, is horribly mistaken,"" Paus said.
""If the next big crisis hits, Deutsche Bank could turn into the next billion-euros grave for German taxpayers' money,"" Paus said, adding that she was against the merger.
Asked if the government had any plans to sell its Commerzbank stake in case of a merger, Finance Ministry official Bettina Hagedorn said that the government would not participate in any speculation regarding the outcome of the still ongoing merger talks between both banks, according to the document.
Scholz and his deputy Joerg Kukies are widely seen as having pushed behind the scenes for a merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank. But since both banks announced their merger talks, Scholz has repeatedly played down the government's role.
The German government has been worried about Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis.

Deutsche is trying to turn itself around under new leadership, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests.

Norwegian last month said it would postpone sales of six other aircraft of the same model, however, to help offset the impact of the worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets.
Under its fleet renewal program, loss-making Norwegian aims to sell older aircraft, often replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient models.
The carrier, which recently raised 3 billion Norwegian crowns ($351 million) in cash from shareholders, said on Wednesday the sale of the two planes would boost its liquidity by a further $21 million after debts are repaid.
""The sale is in line with the company's strategy of capitalizing on the scale built up over the last few years and the changed focus from growth to profitability,"" Norwegian said in a statement.

The company had 164 aircraft in its fleet at the end of 2018.

(Reuters) - Shares in CMC Markets slid more than 10 percent to a record low on Wednesday after the online trading firm forecast a drop in income in the year to March as new rules curbed client activity, and its finance chief decided to depart.
The profit warning dragged down shares in Britain's biggest online trading firms IG Group and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) Ltd.
Regulators are tightening rules on products that allow anyone with a bank card to make highly leveraged bets on financial markets through apps and online platforms.
CMC Markets said it expected net operating income of 131 million pounds ($172.17 million) for the year to March 31, compared with 187.1 million pounds a year before. 
It also forecast a 37 percent drop in revenue to 110 million pounds for the unit that offers complex financial products to retail clients.
""We know that calendar 2019 (year to date) has been weak for retail leveraged trading, but this is more than just industry conditions,"" Liberum analyst Ben Williams (NYSE:WMB) said. 
""They are losing share. It is now a loss-making business and full year 2020 estimates are too high.""

Separately, the company said its chief operating and financial officer Grant Foley would leave the company to pursue other opportunities. 
Britain's financial watchdog said last week it will permanently ban the sale of binary options, which are complex derivative products, to retail consumers to protect them from large and unexpected trading losses.
That is similar to a temporary ban the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has in force across the European Union. ESMA also has temporary curbs on contracts for difference (CFDs).
Binary options allow people to bet on whether the price of a share, currency or index will go up or down within a certain timeframe. CFDs give an investor exposure to price movements in securities without owning the underlying asset.
CMC said the new rules had led to retail clients trading less and using more of their cash to fund margin needs, or needing to deposit more funds with CMC to trade at previous levels. It said however trading showed ""signs of stabilizing"".

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rallied to six-month highs on Wednesday thanks to signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, reassuring economic data and hopes of a softer Brexit, helping push Germany's 10-year bond yield back above zero percent. 
Oil prices rose to within striking distance of the key $70 per barrel mark -- a multi-month high -- on supply concerns.
And sterling extended its gains after British Prime Minister Theresa May said late on Tuesday she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour Party leader, raising hopes of a ""softer"" Brexit.
Signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and decent Chinese and U.S. factory activity data in recent days has lifted sentiment and taken the edge off world recession fears.
Europe's stock markets rose to their highest since August, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed to a seven-month peak. 
That left the MSCI world equity index at a six-month high, while U.S. equity futures pointed to a solid start for Wall Street shares.
""What we're seeing is that markets have climbed a wall of worry but there is progress on trade, a recession is unlikely, central banks have made nods to more dovish policy,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. ""If you put that into the mix I'm not surprised risk assets have moved up."" 
Germany's stock market rose over 1 percent to its highest level since October, while French stocks scaled a similar high. A firmer pound, however, weighed on London's FTSE index, which was flat on the day.
Wednesday's economic news also lifted sentiment: activity in China's services sector picked up to a 14-month high in March, euro zone retail sales were stronger than expected in February.
Hopes for a deal to end the trade war between the world's two largest economies were meanwhile fanned by fresh comments from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Washington expects ""to make more headway"" in talks this week.
""We're being told that we're 90 percent of the way there which is obviously encouraging but the final 10 percent -- which apparently includes the enforcement mechanism and the removal of tariffs -- could take some time to iron out,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London.
""Investors are happy to be patient here in the hope that the two sides get this right and put an end to a trade war that has clearly taken its toll on markets.""
Generally strong world stocks and hopes of a softer Brexit sparked a sell-off in safe-haven government bonds.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose almost 4 basis points to 2.52 percent. 
Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose to 0.01 percent, having hit a 2-1/2 year low at around minus 0.09 percent a week ago. Britain's 10-year gilt yield jumped 7.5 basis points to 1.08 percent, heading for its biggest daily jump in three months.
Safe-haven gold also suffered from stronger world stock markets, dipping to $1,292.63 per ounce.
Oil prices rose for a fourth day, pushing Brent toward a nearly five-month high of $70 a barrel as support from OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions overshadowed a report showing an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories.[O/R]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.16 percent to $62.68, having hit $62.99, the highest since Nov. 7.
BREXIT ROLLER COASTER
Sterling rose further as traders welcomed news that Britain's May would begin cross-party talks with the opposition Labour party as a signal that Britain will end up with a ""softer"" exit from the European Union.
The pound strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.3196, its highest since March 28. The British currency had slipped below $1.30 on Friday on growing fears of a no-deal Brexit.
The dollar strengthened 0.15 percent against the yen to 111.49 and the euro added 0.4 percent to $1.12440.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, eased 0.4 percent to 97.009.

Cryptocurrency bitcoin, which surged 18.7 percent on Tuesday following a major order by an anonymous buyer, added another 1.2 percent to $4,961.20.

1601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Staying on the Sidelines of the Equity Rally Is Starting to Really Hurt,"(Bloomberg) -- Staying away from stocks this year might not have been such a great idea after all.
The S&P 500 is just 2.2 percent away from a record high. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is trading at the highest since August, and both car stocks and Italy’s FTSE MIB are set to close in a bull market today. The German bund yield is dipping below zero, fueling appetite for risk assets. And the latest Euro-area services data shows resilience.
What’s making strategists, including those at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, optimistic that this rally can keep going is that investors continue to avoid equities and are bracing for the worst-case scenario. Global stocks are up 14 percent this year, but a $79 billion exodus from equity funds and reduction of exposure to a 2016 low spells out a rally that is extremely low-conviction.
There was a good reason for investors to be under-invested in European equities: manufacturing activity was weakening. The surprising part is that stocks have almost erased their 2018 losses.
“No one appears to be positioned for good news, and the pain trade still looks to be on the upside,” said Barclays strategists, including Emmanuel Cau, in a note on Wednesday. “We continue to find the risk-reward for equities more attractive than for bonds.""
Traders continue to hide in cash and bonds as the factors that fueled the gains in stocks -- softer monetary policy and optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal -- are fluid and can turn against the market. This is why Guillermo Hernandez Sampere, head of trading at German asset manager MPPM EK, prefers to invest in stocks but keeps some cash in case things go south.
“I wouldn’t blame anyone for staying on the sidelines with all these global issues present. A rally, which is based on hope, and I think we are in the middle of one, holds great danger of a trap,” said Hernandez Sampere. “I would keep some cash, the next dip will come for sure.”
Short-covering was the main driver of this year’s equity bounce, according to Barclays, and macro hedge funds remain long bonds and short equities.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles, the U.S. automaker said on Wednesday, as it seeks to reverse slumping sales in the world's top auto market.
Ford had said previously it would launch 50 new or significantly redesigned vehicles in China starting in 2018 and through 2025, and Wednesday's announcement provides more clarity on the timeline.
Its China operations chief Anning Chen said the automaker is committing itself to improving its relationships with Chinese joint-venture partners and localizing its management teams by hiring and promoting more Chinese nationals and global talent with Chinese expertise, among other initiatives.
The new plans are intended to ""enable us to gain the momentum to break through"" in the marketplace, Chen told a small group of reporters.
Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China, the second biggest market globally for the Dearborn, Michigan automaker, after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales slumped 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017. 

Ford has said its sales crisis stemmed mainly from a lack of new products. Industry experts also ascribe the company’s China trouble to the Sino-U.S. trade war and its rocky relationship with domestic partners Changan Automobile Group and Jiangling Motors Group.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>","Not just Brexit: EU frets next crisis may come from money managers, clearing","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - While Brexit and trade disputes dominate financial headlines, European Union officials are warning about another risk faced by the bloc and the global economy: the growing importance of new, little-regulated systemic financial actors.
Changes in global financial rules and investment strategies have seen the emergence of new giants in global financial markets in recent years, among them clearing houses like London-based LCH and asset managers such as Blackrock (NYSE:BLK).
EU officials warn the swelling of their books has not coincided with a proportionate tightening of their oversight, however, meaning the potential risks they pose to financial stability are growing.
In three confidential EU documents, seen by Reuters, the EU sends hints at new regulations to reduce those risks.
A paper prepared by the Romanian presidency of the EU ahead of an April 5-6 finance ministers meeting invites officials to consider actions to counter challenges to financial stability posed by the asset management industry and clearing houses.
Those dangers are further spelled out in a document by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the body dedicated to protecting the EU's financial stability which is chaired by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
The confidential paper, which will be presented to euro zone finance ministers at the Bucharest meeting, draws up a list of risks to financial stability which include the shadow banking system -- another name for asset managers and investment funds.
The threat-list is topped by trade and Brexit dangers, and also mentions challenges to bank funding and debt sustainability risks.
The main reasons for concern over the shadow banking sector are its increasing size and complexity, the high leverage of some funds, lack of risk monitoring and poor transparency. 
Blackrock, the biggest of all funds, manages some $6 trillion of assets, making some giant banks look tiny in comparison. Despite that, it faces lighter requirements and less stringent oversight than lenders.
EU finance ministers will raise this issue at the G20 level in a meeting with their counterparts in Washington on April 11-12, where they will urge partners to address, if necessary, ""emerging financial vulnerabilities"" springing from the sector.
CLEARING
Clearing houses cause similar headaches after their systemic relevance grew with new regulations that require more transactions to be centrally cleared, rather than being conducted bilaterally.
After the last financial crisis a decade ago, banks in Europe were forced to contribute to a new rescue fund and raise fresh buffers that would be used in case they fail, under the oversight of a new body, the Single Resolution Board (SRB), created with the task of disposing of failing lenders.
But this ""resolution mechanism"" does not cover clearing houses, like the giant LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange, which dominates clearing of euro-denominated derivatives worth trillions.
With Brexit looming, the EU has changed its rules in a way that could force LCH to relocate to the bloc after Britain leaves. That is likely to boost the EU's powers of supervision over systemic clearing houses, but not its ability to limit damage in the event they go bust. 
Clearing risks extend to large investment banks, like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which process huge amounts of securities transactions, the SRB's head Elke Koenig said at a hearing in the European Parliament on Tuesday.
""We have not made the progress we should have made on the recovery and resolution"" of clearing houses, Koenig told EU lawmakers, stressing the issue should be primarily addressed at global level.

These firms have been turned into ""focal points"" of the financial system, making them so systemic that their failure would cause serious trouble, she said, adding that the EU was barely prepared for such an event.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",Toyota to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp will offer free access to its hybrid-vehicle patents through 2030, it said on Wednesday, seeking to expand use of the lower-emission technology even as the global industry shifts toward fully electric cars.
The pledge by one of the world's biggest automakers to share its closely guarded patents, the second time it has opened up a technology, is aimed at driving industry uptake of hybrids and fending off the challenge of all-battery electric vehicles(EVs).
Toyota said it would grant licenses on nearly 24,000 patents on technologies used in its Prius, the world's first mass-produced ""green"" car, and offer to supply competitors with components including motors, power converters and batteries used in its lower-emissions vehicles.
""We want to look beyond producing finished vehicles,"" Toyota Executive Vice President Shigeki Terashi told reporters.
""We want to contribute to an increase in take up (of electric cars) by offering not just our technology but our existing parts and systems to other vehicle makers.""
The Nikkei Asian Review first reported Toyota's plans to give royalty-free access to hybrid-vehicle patents.
Terashi said that the access excluded patents on its lithium-ion battery technology.
UNLOCKING KEY TECHNOLOGY
Toyota's move to unlock its patents underlines its belief that hybrids are an effective alternative to all-battery EVs, given a fuel efficiency roughly double that of gasoline cars, lower cost and that they do not need charging infrastructure.
Toyota vehicles account for more than 80 percent of the global hybrid vehicle market.
""Toyota has realized that they made a mistake by protecting their hybrid technology for years. This prevented diffusion"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.
""Toyota on its own can't get key technology accepted, but if other companies use it, that offers the best chance of expansion,"" she added.
 Since pioneering the Prius in 1997, Toyota has sold more than 13 million hybrids, which twin a conventional gasoline engine and electric motor, saving fuel by capturing energy during coasting and breaking and using it to power the motor.
Hybrid vehicles account for around 3 percent of all vehicles sold globally, eclipsing the roughly 1.5 percent share of all-battery EVs, according to LMC Automotive.
Global automakers have pledged to electrify their offerings as a growing number of countries slash vehicle emissions by as much as half by 2030, but many say that shifting to fully electric cars will take time given high cost of batteries.
Lewis at Macquarie said automakers in China and Europe could be keen to access Toyota's hybrid-vehicle patents as they look for lower-emission cars to sell in lower-tier cities where costly battery EVs are out of reach for many drivers.
Toyota is also betting on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) as the ultimate zero-emissions vehicle, and as a result, has lagged many of its rivals in marketing all-battery EVs.
In 2015, it said it would allow access to its FCV-related patents through 2020.

Flybe, which carries 8 million passengers a year between 81 airports across the UK and Europe, said it was working on some mitigation actions, but did not provide further details.
The airline, which flies over 210 routes across 15 countries, said affected customers can re-book their travel on an alternate flight or apply for a full refund. 
Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital bought Flybe, Britain's biggest domestic airline in February, through a joint venture company called Connect Airways for an initial 2.2 million pounds.

The deal was later revised to sell the airline's main trading company Flybe Ltd and online operation Flybe.com Ltd to the consortium for 2.8 million pounds without needing shareholder backing.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis's spinoff of its eyecare division Alcon, set for Tuesday April 9, marks the largest Swiss stock deal in a decade and forces a reshuffle of the benchmark Swiss Market Index (SMI) as private bank Julius Baer gets booted out.
Novartis has estimated Alcon's value at around 25 billion Swiss francs ($25 billion), while some analysts predict an initial market capitalization of 21 billion francs ($21 billion) to 23 billion, implying shares worth from 43 to 47 francs. 
By contrast Baer's value has tumbled by a third in a year to 9.3 billion francs. It will instead be included in the SMIM index, replacing Aryzta, SIX Swiss Exchange said after Tuesday's market close. 
Dominated by Nestle, Novartis and Roche, the SMI is Switzerland's most important index. Membership is based on market capitalization, adjusted for the free float of readily tradable shares in its constituents.
Alcon is being spun off in a one-for-five share deal announced by Novartis last June as it focuses on new drugs rather than the surgical devices and contact lenses Alcon makes.
Joining the SMI may boost demand from funds focusing on the top Swiss companies. Yet Alcon's inclusion means healthcare and medical technology will weigh even more heavily on the SMI. 
Novartis's weighting had been capped 18 percent, but with Alcon the two will account for up to 21.5 percent of the SMI, Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts estimated on Wednesday.
Novartis's biggest owners - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the Sandoz family, Capital Research Global Investors and Vanguard Group - will have similar holdings in Alcon, between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. 
""We anticipate incremental buying of Alcon shares by some funds seeking to build a full-size position, offset by others not wanting to own a non-pharma eyecare company,"" Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said.
Novartis bought Alcon's eye surgery and contact lens portfolio in stages through 2010 for $52 billion from Nestle, only to see it lose ground to competitors as sales and profitability slipped. 
In surgical equipment, Alcon competes against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Germany's Zeiss and Bausch in a $9 billion per year market. Rivals in vision care, worth $14 billion annually, include J&J, Cooper and Bausch.
In 2016, a new Alcon head, Mike Ball from Hospira, redoubled research and marketing spending to resurrect revenue, before Novartis chief Vas Narasimhan decided to shed the division.
The last comparable-sized Swiss listing was in 2010, when oil driller Transocean floated on the same day its Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",IKEA to test furniture rental in 30 markets,"KAARST, Germany (Reuters) - IKEA will expand tests to allow customers to rent desks and sofas rather than buy them as it shifts away from selling low-cost disposable furniture in response to growing environmental concerns.
The world’s biggest furniture group first said it was looking into furniture leasing in February. It fleshed out its plans on Wednesday at an event held at its first 'sustainable' store in Kaarst, western Germany, opened in 2017.
""Testing out opportunities for leasing offers is one of the ways we are challenging ourselves to deliver on our transformation strategy,"" said Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores. 
""Climate change and unsustainable consumption are among the biggest challenges we face in society.""
IKEA's move toward supporting a more circular economy comes as many young consumers say they want to minimize their impact on the environment, preferring to rent items ranging from clothing to cars.
Its business model has already come under pressure from the rise of online retail and a growing reluctance among younger shoppers to travel to its vast out-of-town stores, get the flat-pack furniture home and assemble it themselves.
Rent the Runway, which has previously only rented out designer apparel and accessories, said last month it will partner with Williams-Sonoma Inc's West Elm brand to allow subscribers to rent home decor.
IKEA, which had global sales of 39 billion euros ($44 billion) last year, said it wants to develop subscription-based leasing offers to encourage products to be reused as many times as possible before being recycled.
It had already committed to make all its products from renewable and recycled materials by 2030 and also to design all its products to be reused, repaired and recycled. In 2018 it handled 1 million orders for spare parts to repair products.
IKEA has already started testing different furniture rental projects in the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Poland, and aims to expand the tests to all its 30 markets next year.

In Sweden and Switzerland, it is looking into providing furniture to companies on a subscription model, while in the Netherlands it is testing a rental package for students in cooperation with a housing association.

The magazine said Commerzbank's management is scheduled to discuss how to proceed in the merger talks during its next regular session, Wirtschaftswoche added, citing company sources and an internal memo.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Upon initiating formal talks with Deutsche Bank on March 17, Commerzbank chief executive officer Martin Zielke told bankers that management aimed for a decision on whether to go forward with a merger in the next two to three weeks, two sources with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
In a memo to employees days later, Zielke wrote: ""I can promise you that we will strive to keep this period of uncertainty as short as possible and we will work hard to ensure that a decision is reached soon.""

Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner said that the banks aim to announce more concrete steps on the merger by late April.

Dunkerton, the former boss of Superdry, on Tuesday was voted back on the board by a slim margin and hours later was named interim chief executive officer after winning the backing of shareholders looking for a revival of the fashion group's fortunes.
The move did not sit well with most of Superdry's board, which had opposed his comeback. Chief Executive Officer Euan Sutherland immediately resigned after five years at the helm.
Dunkerton, who owns 18.4 percent of the equity, quit a year ago after a row over strategy. He takes issue in particular with Superdry's product design and internet plans.
Analysts said the resignations raised fears of more departures as the company deals with a share price that has dropped 64 percent over the past year following several profit warnings, the latest in December.
""We would be more concerned if we see further significant departures from the retail board and operational management teams and view the recruitment of a heavyweight CFO as a priority,"" Peel Hunt analysts said.
(Graphic: Superdry founder to return after profit warnings hit shares - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HWhCeJ)
Analysts also said short-term disruptions were inevitable as Dunkerton steadies the ship and starts to enact his recovery plans, which will tack on costs as the company tries to jump-start revenue.
Superdry's board had accused Dunkerton of a lack of transparency with shareholders and said his return would be damaging and disruptive. The board warned that his return would see directors either resign or not seek re-election.
""The resignation of the entire board of Superdry and its two brokers following co-founder Julian Dunkerton's narrow victory vote yesterday to return as CEO, monumental as it may be, is really only the tip of the iceberg where necessary change is concerned,"" Edison Investment analyst Kate Heseltine, said. 
Analysts said Superdry will need to provide a clear view of the future to investors.
""From here the hard work begins to turn around the fortunes of this once darling retailer that has seen its sales and profits, and the share price, plummet over the past year,"" Heseltine said.

UBS and Investec also left as brokers to Superdry.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) said its effort to expand in gene therapy via the $4.3 billion takeover of Spark Therapeutics remained on track despite failing to get enough votes to clinch the deal and as U.S. regulators continued scrutinizing it.
The Swiss company said it was extending its offer to May 2 from the original deadline of Wednesday, having received support from holders of only 29.4 percent of Spark shares. It needs a majority for its offer to go through. 
A spokesman said Roche remained confident the deal would be completed by the end of June. 
""All terms and conditions of the offer shall remain unchanged during the extended period,"" Roche said in a statement on the $114.50 per share offer it announced in February.
Roche also said a review of the acquisition by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government agency which seeks to prevent anti-competitive practices, was taking more time than anticipated and its plans had had to be refiled.
It did not give any further detail on the refiling but said it had been agreed with the FTC and with Spark.
""The FTC review and clearance is required for the deal to be completed and needs more time,"" a Roche spokesman said. 
""The deal is not in doubt at all and we expect it will be completed according to our guidance in the first half of 2019. There needs to be more than 50 percent of the shares to be tendered, but we believe our offer to be full and fair and it has been recommended by the board of Spark,"" the spokesman added.
GENETIC MATERIAL
Spark shares closed at $114.01 on Tuesday. Roche shares were down 0.3 percent in early trade.
Gene therapies use specially engineered viruses to deliver genetic material into defective cells, in hopes of improving or potentially even curing an inherited condition.
Roche offered more than twice the Philadelphia-based company's closing price on Feb. 22 for a portfolio that includes a blindness treatment that has U.S. and European approval and other projects for hemophilia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease.
The offer came as rivals including Novartis also move into gene therapy, where treatments for rare, inherited diseases command some of the highest prices in medicine. 
Spark's blindness therapy Luxturna for instance is priced at $850,000 per patient. The treatment had sales of $27 million in 2018.
However Spark faces at least three lawsuits in the United States by shareholders challenging the sale, on grounds that it undervalues Spark's stock and is unfair to shareholders. 
Roche on Wednesday declined to comment on the lawsuits. 
Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan is interested in gene therapies to help compensate for patent losses on his $21 billion per year trio of cancer medicines Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which are facing competition from cheaper copies. 

Spark, which also has product candidates that have shown promising early results in patients with hemophilia, reduced its net loss to $78.7 million in 2018, while revenue increased to $64.7 million.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates NBD said on Wednesday it will buy Turkey's Denizbank from Russia's Sberbank at a roughly 20 percent discount to a previously agreed price, after a steep fall in the Turkish lira.
Under a new agreement reached with state-owned Sberbank, Dubai's largest lender said it will buy Turkey's fifth largest private bank for 15.48 billion lira ($2.8 billion), compared to the 14.6 billion lira announced in May.
Although the deal's lira value is higher, the dollar value when it was announced in May was put at the equivalent of $3.2 billion, about $400 million more that the new price.
The lira has tumbled over concerns about the Turkish central bank's independence and Ankara's worsening ties with Washington.
The Denizbank deal comes against a backdrop of Turkey's strained relations with Gulf states since Ankara stood by Qatar after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and others accused Doha of supporting terrorism, a charge it denies.
The transaction will help Emirates NBD diversify its business and establish itself as a leading bank in the region, the bank's vice chairman Hesham Abdulla al-Qassim said in May.
For Russia's biggest bank by assets, the sale of Sberbank's biggest asset outside Russia is part of a shift back to its home market. It bought Denizbank in 2012 for about $3.5 billion when it wanted to establish a presence abroad.
For Emirates NBD, the revised deal represents a discount of roughly 20 percent, a spokesman for the bank told Reuters, without providing further details.
Sberbank said it expected to receive $5 billion from the sale of Denizbank, including capital and debt. The news of the sale sent shares in Sberbank up 1.5 percent at market opening. 
The sale price is based on Denizbank's capital plus 5 percent, according to international financial reporting standards, Sberbank said. The bank added that it expected the deal to be closed by the end of the second quarter of 2019. 

Denizbank's equity amounted to 15.51 billion lira as of December 31, Emirates NBD said in a bourse statement, adding that the deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are heading higher as surveys of the services sector in China and elsewhere raised hopes that the global economy is pulling out of the slowdown that began towards the end of 2018.
News of a possible breakthrough in the Brexit process also supported sentiment, although the boost to the pound ensured that the FTSE 100 lagged its peers, gaining only 0.1% as of 04:15 AM ET (0815 GMT).
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 2.46 points, or 0.6% at 387.48, while the trade-sensitive German Dax led the way with a 1.2% gain.
Asian markets had rallied overnight after the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to its highest level in 14 months. The mood was further improved by a Financial Times report suggesting that a trade deal between the U.S. and China is close (although the newspaper’s sources noted that the last 10% of any trade negotiation are the hardest).
The big question of the day was therefore whether European services PMIs would make up for the shocking readings from manufacturing last week.
They did: the Eurozone services PMI rose to 53.3 from 52.7 in March, beating expectations for an unchanged reading. The improvement was sharpest in  Italy, which has been under a cloud this week after the OECD slashed its growth forecast for the year and issued a dire warning about its debt trajectory. But readings also improved in Germany and France, even if the latter wasn’t enough to bring the composite French PMI above the 50 line that would represent growth.
China-sensitive auto and supplier stocks appear to be getting the most uplift from the data, with French suppliers  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) leading the CAC 40. German rivals Hella (DE:HLE) and Continental (DE:CONG) are likewise outperforming the big local auto brands.
Banks stocks - especially in Spain - are also picking up as the outlook for the economy brightens a bit. Santander (MC:SAN) is up 1.7%, after unveiling another 1.2 billion euros of planned cost cuts. The bank is under pressure to move on from an embarrassing aborted attempt to hire UBS investment bank chief Andrea Orcel as CEO.

The appointments follow an intense, weeks-long battle over who will lead PG&E out of the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. The three shareholders, which collectively own almost 10 percent of PG&E, disclosed their plans to push for changes at the company last month.
They have squared off against activist investor BlueMountain Capital Management, which put forth its own slate of 13 directors. Even California Governor Gavin Newsom joined the fight, urging the company to resist hedge fund picks and appoint local directors.
BlueMountain’s nominees include former California treasurer Phil Angelides, National Transportation Safety Board ex-chairman Christopher Hart and Jeff Ubben, chief executive officer of activist investor ValueAct Capital Management. It’s unclear whether the firm will push ahead with its proxy fight despite PG&E’s agreement with the other group.
The new board will have to guide PG&E through what’s what’s already a contentious reorganization as shareholders, creditors, wildfire victims and California officials grapple over restructuring a utility serving 16 million people in one of the world’s largest economies.
Wildfire Deaths
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January, while facing $30 billion in liabilities tied to wildfires that its equipment may have caused. The company promised a board overhaul and has said its power lines were probably responsible for the deadliest wildfire in California history. The state is continuing to probe the cause of the fire, which killed 85 people last year.
Johnson would succeed Geisha Williams (NYSE:WMB), who resigned as PG&E’s chief executive officer just days before the filing.
Newsom earlier criticized PG&E’s plans to revamp its board with what he described as “hedge fund financiers, out-of-state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations, regulation and safety.” He urged the company to consider a board made up primarily of Californians.
Johnson has already drawn some opposition.
Clean energy advocacy group Vote Solar said in a statement that his track record “falls far short of the kind of commitment to promoting a culture of safety and clean energy progress that PG&E’s customers deserve.” The group pointed to the lack of solar and wind power on TVA’s coal-dependent system and said the utility “makes it hard for customers to go solar.”
Coal made up more than a quarter of TVA’s portfolio last year, with solar and wind accounting for just 3 percent, according to the company’s website. But the utility has been decommissioning some of its oldest coal-fired units to make way for new resources.

The MAX has been grounded globally since last month following two fatal crashes in five months involving the same aircraft type, killing 346 people. 
Boeing has said a software update to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system, which is under scrutiny after the deadly nose-down crashes, would be submitted in the coming weeks.
""Based on their corrective action plan we will validate that plan independently and maybe cooperate with other entities in Europe and based on that if we feel comfortable we will decide [if we lift the grounding],"" General Civil Aviation Authority Director General Saif Mohammed al-Suwaidi told Reuters at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi.

1621,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",Brexit May Bring New Threat for Germany's Beleaguered Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s beleaguered investment bankers could face even more competition when rivals move staff to the country after Brexit.
While relocations from the U.K. will initially have little effect, that may change if banks then use their newly established presence in Germany to expand in the local market for investment banking services, Joachim Wuermeling, the head of banking supervision at the Bundesbank, said in an interview.
“This is a dynamic business, and it may well be that when they wake up in the morning and look around them, they may see that they have further opportunities on the ground,” he said. “Frankfurt’s financial center will become more international and more competitive.""
Such a trend would mean more pain for firms like  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn). While Wuermeling didn’t name any banks, the Frankfurt-based firm is Europe’s biggest investment bank by revenue and has been losing market share to U.S. rivals. After a series of failed turnaround efforts, it is now studying a merger with a smaller German rival  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG).
Both companies have recently emphasized their German roots, but competition for corporate clients in their home market has eroded margins. Commerzbank this year cut its revenue outlook because of that, though new competitors keep entering. Dutch lender  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV announced in 2018 that it wants to increase its German corporate banking staff by 50 percent over the next three years.
Wuermeling and other European banking supervisors have said they are neutral in assessing a potential merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.
“Any merger is first and foremost a decision for the markets and, in particular, for the owners of the banks involved,” Wuermeling said of the deal talks. “If this happens, supervisors will pay it the highest degree of attention.”
A deal between the two German banks could lead to the loss of as many as 30,000 positions, people familiar with the matter have said. Brexit-related relocations of bank jobs to Germany may help offset some of that.
Wuermeling said he expects about 2,000 jobs to be moved to the country by 24 banks this year alone. Frankfurt’s finance lobby puts the number at as many as 2,500 jobs and estimates that the figure could rise to 10,000 in coming years.
“The sales area will weigh heavier at first, but the back office will be built up as well,” Wuermeling said. “What happens in the coming years depends on how much business will relocate.”
In addition to moving staff, banks are also shifting hundreds of billions of euros of balance sheet assets to Germany to prepare for Brexit. While the biggest chunk -- about 400 billion euros ($449 billion) -- will be moved by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). plans to shift about 200 billion euros, people familiar have said. That would turn it into one of Germany’s largest banks.
So far, banks have sought to keep as much of their operations as possible in the U.K. to limit costs, but it’s possible they will eventually move euro-dominated business conducted for clients outside the European Union as well, said Wuermeling, who is also a member of the European Central Bank’s supervisory board.
“Building up risk management and clearing in the euro area could generate a dynamic of its own and they may ask whether it’s worth doing the business in parallel,” he said. “That’s the most interesting question.”
The Bundesbanker urged companies that rely on banking services to switch contracts with U.K. counterparties to entities based in the EU so that they can keep running. Failing to modify the contracts would mean banks aren’t able to provide loans and services as agreed.
“That could cause difficulties,” he said. “They won’t be a threat to financial stability, but the ride could be bumpy.”

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",Ethiopian Airlines pilots initially used Boeing emergency procedures before crash: WSJ,"By Jamie Freed and Jason Neely
SINGAPORE/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX jet that crashed last month had initially followed Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's emergency procedures but later deviated from them as they tried to regain control of the plane, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. 
The crash killed all 157 people on board and led to a global grounding of 737 MAX jets and scrutiny of the certification process for the Boeing plane. 
Boeing had issued guidelines to pilots on how to disable an automated anti-stall system after a deadly crash in Indonesia in October, that were followed by an emergency airworthiness directive by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
The Journal report, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, said the pilots had initially shut off the MCAS anti-stall system that was pushing the airplane's nose down shortly after it took off from Addis Ababa.
The pilots then cranked a manual wheel in an attempt to stabilize the plane, the report said, but they eventually decided to restore power to the usual electric trim on their control yokes, likely because the manual attempt did not achieve the desired results.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Boeing declined to comment.
""We are not commenting on an active accident investigation per international protocols,"" a Boeing spokesman said.
The planemaker said on Monday a proposed software enhancement package to MCAS would be submitted in the ""coming weeks"", having previously said it would deliver the fix for U.S. approval by last week. 
A 737 pilot told Reuters last week it was ""not physically easy to make large trim changes to correct, say, an MCAS input"" by using the wheel. 
""You - or more than likely the other pilot - have to flip out a little handle and wind, much like a boat winch,"" the pilot said.
The Ethiopian Airlines pilots appeared to have restored power to the electric system to cope with a persistent steep nose-down angle, the paper said.
Their actions reactivated MCAS and allowed it to continue its strong downward commands that they were unable to counteract using electric thumb switches, the paper said.
The FAA directive after the Indonesian crash had instructed pilots to use cut-out switches in the center console to shut off the electric power to the system. 
The switches should remain off for the remainder of the flight, the FAA directive said.
A preliminary report by Ethiopian investigators is due within 30 days of the March 10 disaster, according to international rules governing crash investigations.

Ministry of Transport spokesman Musie Yehyies said there were no plans to publish the report on Wednesday.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 01:44AM ET</span>",Pernod Ricard betting on growth from green agenda,"By Dominique Vidalon and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - Drinks group  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which is being targeted by activist investor Elliott, is banking that its push into socially and environmentally sound business practices will boost its growth in the coming decade. 
Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group behind  Diageo  (LON:DGE), is unveiling on Wednesday a strategic roadmap plan going up to 2030.
That plan includes eight pledges to undertake socially responsible business habits, such as preserving and looking after the land used to produce its Martell cognac or Mumm champagne brands.
Other pledges include aims to save water and cut down on waste and carbon emissions, as well as fighting alcohol abuse and promoting gender balance in its top management teams.
Companies around the world are tweaking business models to ensure they capture the current vogue for having strong environmental, social and corporate governance habits ('ESG').
This is partly to win over ""Millennial"" customers who are often keen to help the environment, and to attract investments from funds that specialize in putting trillions of dollars into companies screened for having good ethical criteria.
""It's about making sure we have a very cohesive plan of action that addresses all aspects of our business from grain to glass,"" said Pernod executive Vanessa Wright, speaking to Reuters ahead of the publication of the new Pernod plan.
BROADER PLANS TO BOOST PROFITS
Pernod - together with peers such as Diageo, Danone and Nestle - is looking to respond to new demands from consumers choosing healthier diets and lifestyles seen as helping the environment and communities.
Wright, who is group vice-president for Sustainability & Responsibility at Pernod, said the new ethical pledges formed part of Pernod's broader plan to lift profits and sales, with the French company under pressure from Elliott. 
New York hedge fund Elliott Management wants Pernod to improve profit margins and corporate governance.
Pernod, which also makes Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey, has already vowed to raise operating margins by 50-60 basis point each year between now and 2021, provided it can deliver annual organic sales growth of 4-7 percent.
Pernod is also promising to close the gender pay gap across its business by 2022.
In the last eight years, some 95 percent of Pernod's vineyards have been awarded formal certificates to show they do not harm the environment, while those vineyards have also cut back on the amount of water used and their carbon emissions. 
""A lot of these actions will create long-term value. Value will also come from consumers being more attracted to our brands and we will also save some costs,"" said Wright.
By 2030, Pernod is committing to halve its carbon footprint levels from 2.84 million tonnes per year at present.

It is also hoping to replenish 100 percent of the water consumption at production sites, and will ban promotional items made from single-use plastic by 2025, among other gestures.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 10:09PM ET</span>",AIG paid CEO Duperreault $20.9 million in 2018: filing,"By Ross Kerber and Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) said on Tuesday it paid Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault $20.9 million in 2018 while also outlining a series of reforms to its pay practices in the face of shareholder criticism. 
The pay, for Duperreault's first full year at the helm of the insurer, was less than half the $43.1 million he received in 2017, which included a $12 million cash bonus and other one-time awards.  
At its annual meeting in 2018, only 62 percent of shareholder votes backed the pay, an unusually low number compared with the roughly 95 percent support that major U.S. companies typically receive in such votes. So-called say-on-pay votes are nonbinding but low results often spur directors into action to guard against losing their own seats.
AIG now hopes to win over some of the skeptical investors at this year’s annual meeting, set for May 21 in New York. Potentially making the task harder will be that shares of the company declined 34 percent in 2018.
Duperreault, known in the insurance industry as a turnaround expert, took charge of AIG in May 2017. 
In its proxy, filed on Tuesday, AIG listed a number of steps it has taken in response to shareholder concerns, including tying executive pay more directly to share performance.
For instance, the company said that although Duperreault could have achieved a short-term incentive award of $3.456 million, the board reduced that to $3.04 million in order to reflect “shared accountability” for overall company performance. 

Other changes include an initiative to increase diversity among board members and ensuring that board member nominees who are also chief executive officers and up for election this year serve on only one outside board.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 07:50PM ET</span>",Mrs Watanabe joins activist investors to shake up Japan Inc,"By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - Foreign activist investors who have long complained about Japanese companies' cash-hoarding and stingy payouts to shareholders may have found an unusual ally -- Japanese retail investors.
Market activism has historically been low-key in Japan but a drive by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get investors to be more assertive in their demands for shareholder value has slowly changed this.
That push may pick up momentum in May when representatives from some activist funds, both foreign and domestic, meet hundreds of Japanese retail investors in Tokyo at an event organized by an online broker, a month before the peak of Corporate Japan's annual general meeting (AGM) season.
Such a meeting would have been unheard of in the past, market players say, in a country where offshore activists were seen as ""foreign vultures"" seeking to pillage precious corporate savings.
""There have always been skeptical views that 'hostile' activism can't be as successful in Japan as it is in the United States,"" said Hiroki Tsujimura, chief investment officer (CIO) at Nikko Asset Management. ""However, given the rapidly changing environment, we have started to see successful activists' campaigns recently."" 
The country's retail investors hold about one sixth of domestic shares and are colloquially known as Mrs Watanabe, a reference to the archetypical Japanese housewife and her household investments.
Japan Inc has managed to weather pressure from shareholder activism thanks to still large institutional cross-share holdings. A joint front between foreign activists and domestic retail investors, however, could increase pressure on management.
Already, there are signs of change: the number of companies that had proposals from shareholders at AGMs increased to more than 50 by 2017 from below 30 in 2011, according to Daiwa Institute of Research (DIR).
Those proposals include calls for higher dividend payouts, selling non-core assets, and changing the structures of executive boards.
While such proposals are usually voted down, support for them has increased in recent years, putting pressure on company management, and in some cases, prompting companies to adopt some of the suggestions.
In a recent example, investors in housing products maker Lixil Group last month called for the ouster of top management, citing concerns about corporate governance.
Foreign funds hope the May 19 meeting, hosted by securities broker Monex Group, will help promote the needs of retail investors, who collectively own 1,830 trillion yen ($16.5 trillion) of assets, including 96 trillion yen in listed Japanese stocks.
""The best scenario is that retail shareholders increasingly vote for good shareholder proposals that add value to companies, and increase corporate values across the board,"" said Seth Fischer, founder and CIO of Hong Kong-based Oasis Management, who plans to take part in the meeting.
Fischer sees the meeting as a good opportunity to discuss ideas with retail investors.
Zuhair Khan, head of Japan research at Jefferies, thinks activism can help boost the value of Japanese shares, which currently trade at just 1.1-1.2 times their book value.
He expects even modest success in corporate reforms could boost shares to 2-times their book value.
""The upside to the Japanese stock market of improved governance is huge,"" Khan said.
Monex Group, the organizer of the meeting, said the response from international activist funds has so far been promising.
Oki Matsumoto, founder and chairman of Monex, said increased co-operation could be a win-win for both retail investors and institutional activists.

""I hope the meeting will have some positive impact on voting at AGMs this year,"" Matsumoto said.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 07:30PM ET</span>",U.S. judge orders PG&E to hold dividends to pay for efforts to reduce wildfire risks,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Tuesday that PG&E Corp cannot resume dividends and must use the money to reduce wildfire risk in California, stopping short of more costly measures he proposed earlier this year.
The new criminal probation terms for PG&E are modest compared with ones the judge had in mind in January and that PG&E said could have cost upwards of $150 billion.
The terms will, however, keep PG&E under the supervision of Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and hold the company, which also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, to its target for clearing areas around its power lines of some 375,000 trees this year.
PG&E's probation stems from its felony conviction after a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline blast in San Bruno, California, near San Francisco, that killed eight people and injured 58 others.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29 in anticipation of liabilities from wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze, the Camp Fire. It killed 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.
At a January hearing, Alsup, who is overseeing PG&E's probation, said he felt compelled to propose additional probation terms in the aftermath of Camp Fire. San Francisco-based PG&E expects its equipment will be found to have caused the blaze. 
The probation process is separate from San Francisco-based PG&E's bankruptcy.
As the company faces $30 billion in wildfire liabilities and bankruptcy proceedings, the energy company is expected to name as its new chief executive Bill Johnson, a source said on Tuesday. Johnson has been the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority since 2013 and is retiring on Friday. 
Additional probation terms imposed by Alsup on Tuesday will require PG&E to meet goals in a wildfire mitigation plan it unveiled in February.
The goals include removing 375,000 dead, dying or hazardous trees from areas at high risk of wildfires in 2019, compared with 160,000 last year.
The judge said PG&E will not be able to pay shareholders until it complies with his new probation terms.
Shares fell 2% on Tuesday to close at $17.66 on the New York Stock Exchange and are down 63% since November 2018 due to concerns about the company's bankruptcy and wildfire liabilities. The shares traded as low as $5.07 in January. 
PG&E in December 2017 suspended its quarterly cash dividend, citing uncertainty about liabilities from wildfires in October of that year that struck Northern California.
PG&E paid $798 million in dividends in 2017 and $925 million in 2016, a period in which the company did a poor job of clearing areas around its power lines of hazardous trees, according to Alsup.
Money meant for shareholders should have been spent on efforts to reduce wildfire risks in recent years, Alsup said at Tuesday's hearing.
""PG&E has started way more than its share of these fires,"" Alsup said.
""I want to see the people of California safe,"" the judge added.
Lawyers for PG&E did not contest the new terms, which the company considers more feasible than terms Alsup proposed in January. 
To comply with the terms Alsup proposed in January, PG&E said it would have to remove 100 million trees. The company added that shutting power lines during high winds as Alsup proposed would not be feasible because the lines traverse rural areas to service cities and suburbs.
Idling lines could also affect the power grid in other states, PG&E said.

Alsup on Tuesday said he was still considering his proposal to require PG&E to shut down power lines during windy weather to prevent tree branches from making contact and sparking fires.

Johnson, who has been the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority since 2013 and is retiring on Friday, would not comment on the PG&E rumors.
A group of investors, including Knighthead Capital Management, Redwood Capital Management and Abrams Capital Management, have been pushing for Johnson to be hired.
Before joining TVA, Johnson was the chairman, president and CEO of Progress Energy from 2007-2012 before it merged with North Carolina rival  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK).
Another hedge fund, BlueMountain Capital Management, announced a slate of 13 directors.
Last week California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote to PG&E's interim chief executive officer expressing concern about the company's plans. He wrote, in a letter seen by Reuters, that he is ""troubled to learn that PG&E is primed to reconstitute its board with hedge fund financiers, out-of-state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations, regulation and safety."" 
BlueMountain said last week that it has already proposed a slate of nominees with relevant safety, utility and clean energy expertise, as well as significant experience in the state of California. Its slate includes hedge fund manager Jeff Ubben, who is based in California, and former California Treasurer Phil Angelides.
PG&E faces crushing liabilities related to deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes.

A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered PG&E not to pay shareholders dividends and instead use the money to fund its plan for cutting down trees to reduce the risk its equipment will spark more destructive wildfires in wooded areas of California.

1. ADP Payrolls, ISM Services on Tap
As we near the monthly payroll report, the market gets its first batch of private sector jobs data tomorrow.
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) will report its nonfarm payrolls number for March at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
On average, economists expect that 184,000 private-sector jobs were added last month, about the same as were added in February, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management will release its measure of services activity for March.
The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) is predicted to have fallen to 58.1
Markit will report its final measure of U.S. services activity in March at 9:45 AM ET. Economists predict it remains at 54.8, the same as the preliminary measure.
2. Speed Bumps Ahead for Surging Oil Prices?
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a build.
The American Petroleum Institute released data Tuesday that, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. The API showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 2.963 million barrels last week. That was the second-consecutive weekly build.
Crude bulls will be hoping for better news from the EIA's report, with economists predicting supplies fell 0.425 million barrels for the week ended March. 29.
Crude production will also garner attention after the EIA reported last week that output remained at a record 12.1 million barrels a day in its previous report.
Crude oil futures settled 1.6% higher at $62.58, a fresh high for the year, thanks to declining production from OPEC and its allies such as Russia.
""OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, are intentionally keeping the oil supply tight ... as a result, prices are rising,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",White House sees 'headway' on U.S.-China trade ahead of new talks this week,"By David Lawder and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China ""expect to make more headway"" in trade talks this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday as the top U.S. business lobbying group said differences over an enforcement mechanism and the removal of U.S. tariffs were still obstacles to a deal.
""We expect to make more headway. I can't report any of the details, but it's a larger, grander discussion than anything we've had before in U.S.-China trade relations, and there's a certain amount of optimism,"" Kudlow said in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Kudlow, who directs the White House National Economic Council, acknowledged that there are still issues to be resolved, and the Trump administration will focus heavily on ways to hold China to keep its reform promises and curbing intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers and lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to resume talks with Chinese vice premier Liu He on Wednesday, just days after the two sides reported progress in talks last week in Beijing. 
The Chamber, the largest and most influential business lobbying group, sees increasing chances that Washington and Beijing will reach a deal to end a nine-month tariff war. 
""We're getting to the point where it's clear that both governments want a deal,"" Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's head of international affairs, told reporters. ""The presidents want a deal, and they need to get through the end-game issues. This is a critical week.""
The United States and China have levied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of two-way trade since July 2018, raising costs, disrupting supply chains and roiling global markets.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is pressuring Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries, including changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers.
Trump on Tuesday afternoon repeated his now-familiar refrain that China trade talks were going ""very well"" as he met with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House.
Absent significant process this week on the ""tricky"" issues of tariffs and enforcement, the goal to complete a deal this month may be missed, Brilliant said.
The Trump administration and American companies want structural IP and market economy issues addressed, with a way to ensure China follows through on its promises, Brilliant said. 
U.S. officials favor tariffs as a way to maintain leverage on China and ensure those obligations are met. But it is unlikely that China would agree to an enforcement mechanism that included re-imposition of unilateral U.S. tariffs without the current tariffs being removed, Brilliant said.

The continued threat of tariffs hanging over commerce would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been affected by the trade war.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>",Massachusetts says Wynn Resorts executives concealed sexual misconduct accusations involving Steve Wynn,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts gaming regulators on Tuesday released an investigative report concluding that former executives of Wynn Resorts Ltd concealed sexual misconduct allegations against the casino operator's billionaire founder, Steve Wynn.
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission released the report at the start of a three-day hearing focused on whether Wynn Resorts remains suitable to retain a license needed to run a $2.6-billion casino just outside Boston it plans to open in June.
Wynn has called the sexual misconduct accusations ""preposterous."" His lawyer had no immediate comment on Tuesday.
The report by the commission's investigations and enforcement bureau followed a January 2018 article by The Wall Street Journal detailing allegations that the billionaire had engaged in a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.
His subsequent exit as the company's chief executive and sale of his 11.8-percent stake in the company made him one of the most prominent corporate executives to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted longstanding patterns of sexual harassment and abuse in major U.S. institutions.
Wynn Resorts said in a Tuesday statement it arranged for Wynn to leave without severance, cooperated with the Massachusetts inquiry and has parted ways with any employee who did not investigate or report allegations against Wynn.
Wynn Resorts shares were up 1.9 percent at $131.85.
Massachusetts investigators concluded that over several years, a limited group of executives and employees disregarded company policies when it came to allegations of sexual misconduct against Wynn involving other employees.
The 199-page report said certain executives, with the help of outside lawyers, also took steps after learning about allegations against Wynn to conceal them.
""Their efforts at secrecy made it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for gaming regulators to detect this potentially derogatory information through typical regulatory means,"" the report said.
The report said the actions of those now-former executives ""appear to have contributed to a culture where employees were reluctant to report allegations against Mr. Wynn to management.""
The Las Vegas-based company received its Massachusetts license in 2013, allowing it to move forward with building the 671-room ""Encore Boston Harbor"" in Everett, Massachusetts.
The five-member commission is not expected to issue a decision for several weeks. It can impose conditions on the Las Vegas-based company's license or revoke it entirely. 

Nevada casino regulators, following a similar investigation into its response to allegations against Wynn, in February fined the company $20 million.

DETROIT (Reuters) - A former top United Auto Workers official in charge of the union's relations with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) pleaded guilty on Tuesday in a U.S. federal court in Detroit to misusing the automaker's funds for lavish spending on UAW officials.
As part of a plea agreement, Norwood Jewell, who headed the UAW's FCA department from 2014 until his retirement in January 2018, pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to violate the Labor Relations Management Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a fine of up to $250,000. 
Jewell is the highest-ranking former UAW official charged so far in a wide-ranging investigation into illegal payoffs to UAW officials by FCA. To date, seven people linked to the union and the automaker have been sentenced in the government's corruption investigation.
Jewell's court appearance comes at a sensitive time for the UAW, which faces contract talks later this year with FCA, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. 
Prosecutors say FCA officials conspired to divert to UAW officials more than $4.5 million in training center funds intended to pay for training for union members. 
Both the UAW and FCA have repeatedly said that only a few individuals were involved and that this did not affect contract talks between the two in 2015.
Dressed in a black suit, charcoal gray shirt and a black-and-blue striped tie, Jewell told the court he failed to properly apportion funds between his two roles at the UAW and the National Training Center funded by the FCA to train workers. 
""I own up to what I did and I am taking responsibility for my actions,"" Jewell said.
Prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 12 months to 18 months.
According to court documents, Jewell used the FCA's National Training Center credit card and approved the use of the credit cards by other UAW officials to make more than $40,000 worth of charges for items such as travel and meals.
Defense attorney Michael Manley told reporters the corrupt practices preceded Jewell's appointment in 2014, that he had worked to halt those practices and ""that he did not take anything for personal gain.""

""My hope is that he will not go to jail,"" Manley said.

Shares of the company fell 7.52 percent to $9.34 in extended trading after GameStop also reported quarterly revenue below analysts' estimates.
GameStop has struggled in the face of a changing retail landscape and in March named retail industry veteran George Sherman chief executive officer, its fifth CEO in just over a year.

The company also forecast a 5 to 10 percent drop in total and same-store sales for 2019.
For the latest quarter, GameStop posted adjusted earnings of $1.60 per share, scraping past analysts' estimates of $1.58 per share.

Net sales fell 7.6 percent to $3.06 billion, missing estimates of $3.28 billion.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 04:46PM ET</span>",Purdue's Sackler family fights 'inflammatory' Massachusetts opioid case,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family behind OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP have asked a judge to toss a lawsuit by the Massachusetts attorney general that claims they helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, arguing it contains ""misleading and inflammatory allegations.""
The wealthy family in a motion on Monday argued that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's lawsuit mischaracterized internal records to create the ""false impression"" they personally directed privately-held Purdue's marketing of painkillers.
Her lawsuit, filed in June in Suffolk County Superior Court and revised earlier this year to include new allegations, was the first by a state to try to hold Sackler family members personally responsible for contributing to the opioid epidemic.
The case is among roughly 2,000 lawsuits filed mostly by state and local governments seeking to hold Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies responsible for the opioid crisis.
Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Healey's complaint cites records to argue that family members, including Purdue's former President Richard Sackler, personally directed deceptive opioid marketing while making $4.2 billion from Purdue from 2008 to 2016.
They did so even after Purdue and three executives in 2007 pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay a total of $634.5 million in penalties, the lawsuit said.
But in their motion, the Sacklers said nothing in the complaint supports allegations they personally took part in efforts to mislead doctors and the public about the benefits and addictive risks of opioids.
They said their role was limited to that of typical corporate board members who participated in ""routine"" votes to ratify the management's staffing and budget proposals.
""Not a single document shows an individual director engaging in any unlawful conduct regarding the sale of prescription opioids or ordering anyone else to do so,"" the Sacklers' lawyers wrote.
Healey, in a statement, called the motion ""an attempt to avoid accountability.""
At least 35 states have cases pending against Purdue. Four have also named Sackler family members as defendants, including Richard Sackler, Theresa Sackler and Mortimer D.A. Sackler.
Last week, Purdue reached its first settlement in the recent wave of lawsuits, agreeing with the Sacklers to a $270 million deal with Oklahoma's attorney general. Oklahoma's lawsuit did not name Sacklers as defendants. 

Purdue had been exploring filing for bankruptcy before the accord's announcement, Reuters reported in early March.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 03:49PM ET</span>","U.S. March, first-quarter auto sales drop in weak start to 2019","By Nick Carey and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday reported weak U.S. sales for March and the first quarter, citing a rough start to the year, but said a robust economy and strong labor market should encourage consumers to buy more vehicles as 2019 rolls on. 
Passenger-car sales suffered throughout the first quarter versus the same period in 2018 as Americans continued to abandon them in favor of larger, more comfortable, and for automakers, far more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs.
The battle for market share in the particularly lucrative large-pickup truck market intensified in the quarter, as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV'S (FCA) Ram brand outsold No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's Chevrolet-brand trucks. 
The two automakers have both launched redesigned pickup trucks. For decades Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has had the single best-selling truck brand in its F-Series trucks, with the Chevy brand a solid No. 2, and Ram a distant third.
In the fourth quarter the Chevy and Ram brands were tied for second place behind Ford.
GM said versions of its new Silverado pickup trucks that are already on the market rose 20 percent in the first quarter versus sales of the old model in 2018. GM said it is still ramping up production of remaining variants of the truck. 
Overall, U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to decline in 2019 after a long bull run since the end of the Great Recession, led by falling passenger car sales. Competition in the high-margin SUV market is intensifying. 
Ford on Tuesday unveiled details of the latest version of its Escape SUV, heavily emphasizing comfort features including a movable rear seat to provide more leg room for passengers, plus consumer-friendly features such as an 8-inch (20.3 cm) touchscreen and Wi-Fi connection for up to 10 devices within 50 feet (15.2m) of the vehicle.
GM's first-quarter sales fell 7 percent, with declines across all brands. Sales of Silverado pickup trucks fell nearly 16 percent and the high-margin Chevy Suburban large SUV dropped 25 percent. 
GM and Ford do not report monthly sales. Ford is scheduled to release its first-quarter sales on Thursday.
FCA reported a 7 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and a 3 percent drop for the first quarter. All of FCA's brands dropped in March, except for Ram, which saw a 15 percent increase in pickup truck sales.
""The industry had a tough first quarter, but with spring finally starting to show its face and continued strong economic indicators ... we are confident that new vehicle sales demand will strengthen going forward,"" FCA's U.S. head of sales, Reid Bigland, said in a statement. 
Toyota Motor Corp reported a 3.5 percent fall in U.S. sales in March and 5 percent for the first quarter, hurt by declining demand for its Corolla sedans and Camry vehicles.
""While some of our competitors are abandoning sedans, we remain optimistic about the future of the segment,"" Toyota said in a statement.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd posted a 5.3 percent drop in sales in March, and its first-quarter sales were down 11.6 percent.
Honda Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co bucked the trend. Honda's U.S. sales rose 4.3 percent in March and 2 percent in the quarter, while Hyundai's were up 1.7 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.

Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive have predicted a 2.1 percent drop in U.S. auto sales in March, partly due to bad weather, mixed economic data and lower tax refunds.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>","Brazil ports linked to Bunge, Cargill seek lower Panama Canal fees","By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian port operators including units of global grain traders Cargill Ltd and Bunge Ltd will unveil a proposal this week to lower Panama Canal tariffs and cut their costs in shipping agricultural commodities to their main market China.
They will argue that at current tariffs, shipping grains from Brazil's northern ports via the Cape of Good Hope is almost $206,000 cheaper on a per-ship basis than using the Canal, despite the shorter distance.
In a study to be presented at a conference in Panama City on Thursday, the private port operators association ATP will propose using the idle capacity of the old Panama Canal instead of the congested large new locks opened in 2016 for Panamax ships.
This could potentially cut shipping costs and shorten journey times by 4-5 days between Brazil, the world's leading soybean supplier, and the Chinese and other Asian markets, according ATP, of which Cargill, Bunge, Brazil's grain trader Amaggi and pulp and paper producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA are members.
The operators hope their proposal will open the way for talks between Brazil and Panama to find a way to slash tariffs.
""It is good for both sides, because today Panama no longer receives a significant number of Brazilian grain ships bound for China due to the inexistence of a tariff agreement,"" Luciana Guerise, ATP executive director, said in a statement sent to Reuters.
ATP said the tariff proposal has to be made by the Brazil's agriculture ministry to the country's foreign affairs ministry, which would be responsible for negotiating the terms with Panamanian authorities.
Neither of the ministries had an immediate comment.
The initiative marks a new step in the development of new trading routes for Brazil, the world's largest exporter of agricultural commodities including soybeans, sugar, coffee, tobacco, orange juice, pulp, beef and chicken. 
An initial step in that direction was taken in March last year when Aprosoja, an association of grain growers in Mato Grosso state, signed a cooperation agreement with the Panama Canal Authority.

""We believe we can capture part of the grains that leave Mato Grosso and reach the north of Brazil,"" Jorge Quijano, the Canal's chief executive, said then. ""The Panama Canal would be an option for the product to reach Asia, especially China.""

Daniel Mattes was accused of overstating the Palo Alto, California-based company's revenue more than tenfold, making $14.6 million by selling his shares from April 2014 to February 2015, hiding the sales from Jumio directors, and falsely telling Jumio lawyers that the directors approved the sales.
Mattes, 46, who lives in Wels, Austria, also told at least one investor he was not selling his shares because there was ""lots of great stuff coming up"" at the privately held company and ""he'd be stupid to sell at this point,"" the SEC said.
The SEC said Mattes agreed to disgorge $16.76 million including interest and pay a $640,000 civil penalty.
Former Chief Financial Officer Chad Starkey will pay $421,000 to settle SEC charges related to Jumio's financials and Mattes' stock sales.
Neither Mattes nor Starkey admitted or denied wrongdoing.
""Company executives must provide investors with accurate information irrespective of whether their companies are publicly or privately traded,"" Erin Schneider, the SEC associate regional director in San Francisco, said in a statement.
Jumio filed for Chapter 11 protection in March 2016, after restating its financials the prior September, and was bought by the venture capital company Centana Growth Partners. Airbnb, Coinbase and WeWork are among Jumio's current clients.
Mattes is now chief executive of 42.cx, an artificial intelligence startup he founded that is based in Vienna.
In a phone interview, Mattes said he was ""a little bit emotional about this whole topic"" because he was no longer with Jumio, but wanted to ""move on with my life"" and agreed to settle.
""I created a market over the years, ramped the company up,"" Mattes said. ""The company was worth a lot, then it was worth nothing, and now it's thriving and even better than ever.""
A lawyer for Starkey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Care.com's stock tumbled last month after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company listed U.S. caregivers who had police records and were later accused of committing crimes while caring for clients' children or elderly relatives.
Best Buy had offered Care.com's Care@work service as a benefit to its employees. 
""We have suspended our relationship with Care.com as we do a thorough review of both the program and the company,"" Best Buy spokesman Jeff Shelman said in a statement. ""We remain committed to providing affordable back-up childcare to our employees.""
Care.com spokeswoman Nancy Bushkin said in an email that her company hopes to resume providing its service to Best Buy.
""While disappointed, we respect Best Buy’s decision and are committed to working closely with their teams to confirm the safety of our backup care services and the value they have already begun to bring to their employees,"" Bushkin said.

The development between Best Buy and Care.com was reported earlier in a research note from Wall Street firm BTIG, which lowered its rating on Care.com as a result.

1648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>","Goldman Sees Earnings Boost in Financials, Says Buy Call Options","(Bloomberg) -- As big banks get set to kick off the U.S. corporate earnings season next week,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is advising investors to use call options to position for a rally in financial stocks into May.
Goldman derivatives strategists led by John Marshall underscored the “extreme underperformance” in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, known by its ticker XLF, and the KBW Bank Index -- even after adjusting for the moves in equities, credit and rates. “We see the potential for a relief rally,” they wrote in a research note Tuesday.
Large-cap banks have underperformed their normal correlation with macro assets by more than 10 percent over the last two months, while the $22.7 billion XLF has trailed it by 6 percent, the strategists wrote. They recommend buying calls on XLF and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). to “position for this upside asymmetry.”
Specifically, they advise clients to buy XLF May $27 calls for 32 cents, versus a stock reference price of $26.34, and the BAC May $29 calls for 78 cents versus a stock reference price of $28.54.
Financial stocks came under pressure last month after Federal Reserve officials said they don’t expect to raise interest rates this year. While XLF has recouped much of its post-Fed declines, it’s still down more than 9 percent from last year’s high in September.
The strategists cite Goldman Sachs prime brokerage data coupled with the timing of underperformance that appears to show institutional investors, particularly hedge funds, are underweight financials. “This underpositioning creates a situation where upside asymmetry is undervalued,” they wrote.
The first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season begins in earnest next week, with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. scheduled to report."
1649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. government warns ads for lab-grown diamonds must be crystal clear,"By Diane Bartz and Barbara Lewis
WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which investigates allegations of deceptive advertising, said on Tuesday that it has sent warning letters to eight companies insisting that they distinguish in advertisements between diamonds that come from mines and those made in laboratories.
The FTC declined to identify the recipients of the letters. An unredacted version of one letter viewed by Reuters identified the recipient as Diamond Foundry, a California company that makes laboratory diamonds. Diamond Foundry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agency said that it had found instances in which the eight companies advertised diamond jewelry ""without clearly and conspicuously disclosing that the diamonds are laboratory-created,"" according to the letter.
Analysts say increased production of laboratory-grown diamonds will lower the price of the stones.
The Diamond Producers Association (DPA), which represents mining companies like De Beers,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and Alrosa, welcomed the FTC insistence that companies distinguish between diamonds that are mined and those that are made in laboratories.
""The DPA has for several months expressed serious concerns about misleading marketing communication and unsubstantiated eco claims coming from many laboratory grown diamond marketers,"" said DPA Chief Executive Jean-Marc Lieberherr. 
De Beers, a unit of  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), said it was pleased by the move, saying the two kinds of diamonds were ""distinct product categories.""
De Beers has responded to pressure from lab diamonds by tearing up its decades-old policy of only selling natural diamonds in jewelry and beginning to sell synthetic stones. It sells the lab-made diamonds for less than rivals to emphasize the difference between what it sees as fun, fashion jewelry and natural diamonds created in the earth and with a high re-sale value.
Since it began selling synthetic gems as jewelry it said the cost of synthetic's stones has plunged.
The FTC, in its letters, also asked the companies to review the use of ""eco-friendly"" or similar terms to describe diamonds made in a laboratory. ""It is highly unlikely that they can substantiate all reasonable interpretations of these claims,"" the FTC said in its release.
The first lab-made diamond was made in 1955 and larger crystals were made in 1970, but the first synthetic diamonds for purchase were not made until 1970s, according to Dr. James Shigley, research fellow at the Gemological Institute of America.

""These lab grown diamonds are diamonds. They have the same physical and chemical properties. We're not talking about an imitation,"" he said, noting that many diamonds are sold for grinding or other industrial purposes.

1650,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",StockBeat: Delta Air Lines Lifts off on Bullish Outlook,"Investing.com - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) soared Tuesday after lifting its earnings guidance for the first quarter amid ""healthy"" demand.
Delta guided first-quarter adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 a share, up from a prior forecast for $0.70 to $0.90 a share, sending its shares up more than 6%.
The airline also highlighted ""healthy"" revenue from its corporate sector, which tends to make up the bulk of margin growth for airlines.
The carrier expects top-line growth of 7% in the first quarter, while total revenue per seat mile, a key industry metric, is expected to increase by about 2% year over year.
Non-fuel unit costs are expected flat to up 0.5% year over year, better than initial guidance of up 1% to 2%.
Delta also announced that it extended its Skymiles credit card contract with  American Express  (NYSE:AXP).
The surge in Delta prompted a wave of buys across airline stocks, with United Continental (NASDAQ:UAL) up 2.7% and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) up 2%.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) lagged, rising just 0.8% as sentiment around the stock remains somewhat subdued after the carrier last week cut its first-quarter unit revenue and capacity guidance and raised its cost outlook, citing the negative impacts of the government shutdown, weather disruptions and flight cancellations.
The grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max aircraft and a higher number of planes than normal already out of service from its fleet were also blamed for the weaker guidance.
Southwest will continue to ground its Boeing 737 Max fleet through May, extending its earlier timeline from April 20, Reuters reported, citing an internal document."

A spokesman said Metro was talking with more than two serious investors.

The paper said that would make the break-up of Real more likely, as both are more interested in the chain's real estate rather than taking it on as a going concern, although Metro Chief Executive Olaf Koch wants to sell it as a whole.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's stock sank further below its IPO price on Tuesday after receiving its first negative review from an analyst who is skeptical that consumers will give up car ownership in favor of relying on ride-hailing services.
Shares of the money-losing San Francisco company fell as much as 4.2 percent to $66.10 on Tuesday, their second straight session of losses after a hotly anticipated $72 initial public offer on Friday. The stock was down 2.3 percent at $67.41 early on Tuesday afternoon on the Nasdaq.
The stock's weak performance could make investors more cautious about a string of expected public listings from Silicon Valley unicorns, including Uber Technologies Inc and Pinterest, which are also unprofitable.
Seaport Global initiated coverage of Lyft with a ""sell"" rating and a $42 price target, with analyst Michael Ward calling the stock's current valuation a ""leap of faith"" that consumers will forego owning cars in favor of using ride-hailing services.
""Despite the optics of vehicles being an underutilized asset, we believe people will continue to own their own vehicles as primary transportation and instead rely on the ridesharing services as a convenient supplement,"" Ward wrote in a client note.
Another five analysts have initiated coverage of Lyft, with two of them recommending the stock and three assigning neutral ratings.
Those five analysts on average expect Lyft's revenue to jump 60 percent to $3.45 billion in 2019, while Ward estimated 2019 revenue would reach $3.40 billion.
Lyft reported a loss of $911 million in 2018, wider than its $688 million loss in 2017, despite revenue doubling in 2018 to $2.16 billion. It has not said when it expects to become profitable.

The stock, which surged as high as $88.60 in the first few minutes after its listing on Friday before slipping steadily lower, is now trading at about 5.7 times expected annual revenue. By comparison, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's stock is currently at 4.8 times expected revenue, while  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is at 6.5 times expected revenue.

(Reuters) - A three-day surge in U.S. stocks stalled on Tuesday, as a downbeat forecast from drugstore chain Walgreens Boots hit the pharma sector and economic data did little to ease growth concerns.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was dragged down by a 12.2% slump in Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc after the company cut its 2019 profit growth forecast and reported a quarterly profit that missed analysts' estimates.
The S&P consumer staples index was down 0.7%, leading declines among nine of the 11 major S&P sectors that were down. Rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) fell 3%, while shares of several drug wholesalers also took a hit.
Data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods slipped in February and shipments were flat.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, or core capital goods orders, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.1%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it to remain unchanged.
The data comes on the heels of a survey showing a surprise rebound in China's manufacturing activity and better-than-expected U.S. numbers, which drove the S&P 500 to near six-month highs on Monday.
""We've gotten to a place and time where we are going to need new evidence to move this market higher,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""Incrementally better-than-expected data might move this market higher, which was not the case in today's durable goods number.""
At 12:43 p.m. ET, the Dow was down 106.92 points, or 0.41%, at 26,151.50 and the S&P 500 was down 3.47 points, or 0.12%, at 2,863.72.
The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.89 points, or 0.06%, at 7,833.80, boosted by a 2.8% jump in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Despite coming under pressure, the S&P 500 is 2.4% away from a record closing high hit in late September, held back by trade uncertainties, the Federal Reserve's plans to end monetary policy tightening, Britain's chaotic exit from the European Union and concerns about corporate profit growth.
With the first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season about two weeks away, investors are bracing for what may be the first U.S. profit decline since 2016. Analysts expect quarterly earnings to fall 2%, according to Refinitiv data.
Airline stocks got a lift from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Inc's better-than-expected first-quarter profit forecast. Its shares jumped 6.5%, while the Dow Jones US Airlines index was up 3.2%.
Dow Inc was up 4.7% in its stock market debut following the spin off from DowDuPont.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 31 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 44 new highs and 33 new lows.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",BlackRock's Larry Fink overhauls leadership ranks in key business units,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, has made changes to its senior leadership ranks aimed at winning more business from top institutional clients and boosting growth of its alternative investing business, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
BlackRock, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management, is giving primary responsibility for those institutional clients to executives in local regions.
It is also putting Edwin Conway in charge of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a group of complex investment products that Chief Executive Larry Fink thinks can amp up the company's profits.
BlackRock, known best for funds that track the stock and bond markets, has been putting more emphasis on so-called illiquid alternative investments, complex investments including private equity and real estate that typically come with higher fees and are more likely to be sold to an institution than a mom-and-pop investor.
Conway, previously head of Blackrock's institutional client business, will succeed David Blumer, who is becoming an adviser. The alternative group's chairman is Mark Wiseman, one of several people tipped as Fink's possible successors .
As part of the changes, Mark McCombe, another potential Fink successor, takes on a new role as chief client officer to work with global clients, including governments, financial companies and investment consultants that steer money from big clients, such as pension funds. Rob Fairbairn, who is already responsible for some top clients, becomes a vice chairman. 
Fink, one of BlackRock's founders in 1988, has neither signaled any intention to leave nor publicly named a successor. He told analysts last year that he thinks the alternative investments business can be a source of major growth for the company.
Asset managers have been squeezed by rising competition and pressure to reduce fees, and in recent months many have been cutting jobs and costs. Even BlackRock, which has benefited by offering low-cost exchange-traded funds, announced layoffs in January. At the time Fink pledged to continue investing in what he sees as growth opportunities.
The changes ""show our commitment to constant reinvention and to the ongoing development of our senior leaders,"" Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito wrote in the memo. ""They are also designed to reinvigorate our approach at every level of the firm – and with every employee – at a critical time.""

Other changes announced on Tuesday included naming a new head of its Latin American business and corporate strategy. BlackRock elevated a new chief product officer, Patrick Olson, to a role that had been unfilled. Richard Prager, who runs the company's trading and its lucrative operations lending out stocks, will retire. And Rick Rieder, a top BlackRock investor and global chief investment officer of fixed income, will be leading a ""Global Allocation"" team that picks investments across stocks, bonds and commodities.

Debt ended the year at about $243.2 trillion from $239.9 trillion at the end of 2017, after hitting a nominal record high of $248 trillion at the end of the first quarter. The year-end figure was little changed when compared with gross domestic product globally, ending close to the 2017 figure at 317% of GDP, though ""still very high by historical standards,"" according to the report.
Among developed or mature markets debt grew 2.2%, but the ratio to GDP remained little changed at about 390%. However, the overall steadiness does not reflect increases in the ratio from Japan, France and Australia, while debt ratios fell in Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal.
Debt grew in the United States by the most since 2007, but strong economic growth drove the debt-to-GDP ratio to its lowest level since 2005 - though it is still high at 326%.
Emerging markets' debt grew at the slowest pace since 2001, adding about $1 trillion, or under 25% of the average increase in the five previous years. The debt-to-GDP ratio in emerging markets was also steady at around 212%.
Government debt in emerging markets rose to a record 49.7% of GDP, with the largest ratios coming regionally from Asia and Latin America.
""High levels of interest spending on public debt threatens productive allocation of public resources,"" the report said, singling out Brazil, Lebanon and Egypt.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Bayer board says pursuit of Monsanto was done diligently,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer's non-executive board reaffirmed its support for top management's decision to acquire seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, after losing high-profile lawsuits to U.S. plaintiffs who claimed Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller caused their cancer.
In documents posted on the company's website on Monday, the non-executive supervisory board said an expert opinion it commissioned from lawfirm Linklaters found that Bayer's management had complied with their duties when acquiring Monsanto for $63 billion last year.
""The Supervisory Board extensively discussed this expert opinion and based on this also comes to the conclusion that the Board of Management acted in compliance with its duties,"" it said.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) shares have lost more than 35 percent of their value, equivalent to about 33 billion euros in market capitalization, since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because its Monsanto unit did not warn of Roundup's alleged cancer risks. It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month.
Although the German drugs and pesticides maker is appealing the verdicts, more than 10,000 similar cases are pending in state and federal courts, with analysts predicting the company will have to pay out billions of dollars in settlements.
Shareholders are expected to express their discontent at Bayer's annual general meeting on April 26.
Monday's statement by the non-executive board was published in a joint reply from Bayer's management and supervisory boards to countermotions brought by some shareholders for the AGM. 
Chief Executive Werner Baumann, who broke cover on his pursuit of Monsanto within weeks of taking the top job in 2016, has said in newspaper interviews that he enjoys the backing of the supervisory board.
The supervisory board in Germany's two-tier corporate board system has to sign off on larger transactions and Bayer's non-executive Chairman Werner Wenning backed the Monsanto deal throughout, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is not likely carcinogenic to humans. 
The World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion, classifying glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 10:04AM ET</span>",Shell to quit U.S. refining lobby over climate disagreement,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Tuesday became the first major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave a leading U.S. refining lobby due to disagreement on climate policies.
In its first review of its association with 19 key industry groups, the company said it had found ""material misalignment"" over climate policy with the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) and would quit the body in 2020.
The review is part of Shell's drive to increase transparency and show investors it is in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement's goals to limit global warming by reducing carbon emissions to a net zero by the end of the century.
It is also the latest sign of how investor pressure on oil companies is leading to changes in their behavior around climate. 
""AFPM has not stated support for the goal of the Paris Agreement. Shell supports the goal of the Paris Agreement,"" the Anglo-Dutch company said in its decision.
Shell said it also disagreed with AFPM's opposition to a price on carbon and action on low-carbon technologies.
AFPM Chief Executive Chet Thompson thanked Shell for its ""longstanding collaboration.""
""Like any family, we aren't always fully aligned on every policy, but we always strive to reach consensus positions on policies,"" Thompson said in a statement. 
""We will also continue working on behalf of the refining and petrochemical industries to advance policies that ensure reliable and affordable access to fuels and petrochemicals, while being responsible stewards of the environment.""
AFPM counts around 300 U.S. and international members including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  BP  (LON:BP) and Total that operate 110 refineries and 229 petrochemical plants, according to its 2018 annual report.
Shell's review was welcomed by Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, which invests in Shell and led discussions with the company over its climate policy.
""This is an industry first,"" Matthews said. 
""With this review Shell have set the benchmark for best practice on corporate climate lobbying not just within oil and gas but across all industries. The challenge now is for others to follow suit.""
WALK AWAY
Shell also found ""some"" misalignment with nine other trade associations, including the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's main lobby. 
Shell said that while it had some climate-related differences with API, it welcomed the lobby's advocacy on a range of state and federal issues such as trade and transport, as well as the API's efforts to reduce methane emissions.
It will continue to engage with the API and other groups over climate policies and monitor their alignment, Shell said.
Last year, Shell caved in to investor pressure over climate change, setting out plans to introduce industry-leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay.
Its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, has since repeatedly urged oil and gas producers to take action over climate and pollution.
""The need for urgent action in response to climate change has become ever more obvious since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. As a result, society's expectations in this area have changed, and Shell's views have also evolved,"" van Beurden said in the report.
""We must be prepared to openly voice our concerns where we find misalignment with an industry association on climate-related policy. In cases of material misalignment, we should also be prepared to walk away.""
Shell last month urged President Donald Trump’s administration to tighten restrictions on emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, instead of weakening them as planned.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 10:04AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's huge Airbus order padded by old or incomplete deals - sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - A landmark order from China for 300 Airbus jets signed during a state visit last week was bolstered by repeat announcements of dozens of existing deals and advance approval for deals that have yet to be struck, two people familiar with the matter said.
Echoing an umbrella order for 300 Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets awarded during a visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump in 2017, the headline figure for the new ""framework order"" for European jets was partly driven by political considerations, the people said.
The Airbus deal would have been worth some $35 billion at list prices but the amount of new business is lower, they added. Duplicate announcements included a deal for 10 A350 aircraft to an unnamed buyer, which represents a repeat announcement of an order for 10 jets by Sichuan Airlines at an air show last year.
The disclosure takes some of the shine off an announcement widely regarded as the economic highlight of a trip to Europe by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nonetheless the deal marked a return to the aircraft market by China's state buying agency after a pause of over a year during global trade tensions.
The overall figure of 300 was introduced late in the process and after Xi's visit was underway, although plane orders typically take months to negotiate, one of the people said.
Airbus declined to comment on detailed orders but left open the possibility that the large total contained gaps.
The agreement ""creates the approval framework for aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines, be it existing orders or future orders,"" a spokesman said.
TRADE TIES
Airbus shares fell 0.7 percent on Tuesday, extending earlier losses after Reuters reported gaps in the China deal. Airbus' stock had risen almost two percent after China's mega-order, signed in Paris on March 25 in front of Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Industry sources say major planemakers play by similar rules when selling to China, where they face a two-tier system of negotiations with airlines within a framework of state-backed umbrella deals that may be influenced by geopolitics.
But the headline figures for new orders during high-profile diplomatic visits, which for several years hovered around 150 aircraft for both Airbus and Boeing, have increased as trade ties between Washington and China go through highs and lows.
In November 2017, months before a trade war erupted with the imposition of tariffs, China announced an order for 300 Boeing jets during a visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Analysts expressed doubts at the time over how much of that was new business, and said part of the announcement represented renewed government support for deals already on Boeing's books.
""The most recent Airbus and Boeing deals followed a similar pattern,"" said a China aircraft industry specialist.
Boeing is now seen as next in line to secure a 200-300-plane order as part of a possible economic truce being negotiated to end the trade war, but the recent grounding of one of its jets has cast uncertainty over the timing of the deal.
Boeing and Airbus compete fiercely to serve the needs of the world's fastest-growing airplane market, while bracing for future competition from China's own aerospace industry. 

Analysts say Beijing tends over time to balance U.S. and European purchases, though recent years have seen the rise of a growing number of independent Chinese leasing companies and an increase in autonomous decision-making by several airlines.

“There is ample liquidity everywhere in the world, the corporate sector needs less protection against volatility because there is less volatility, but volatility can happen in a very harsh way for a few days,” Lemierre said in a Bloomberg Television interview Tuesday. The environment seen in 2018 is continuing “now because of the monetary policy decided both by the Fed and the ECB.”
Lemierre is joining a growing chorus of bankers who warn that markets haven’t returned to normal. UBS Group AG Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti last month described the first quarter as one of the most challenging in years. While Lemierre stopped short of providing details on his bank’s performance this year, he hinted that restructuring efforts happening at “all banks” could help improve earnings.
“Banks are adapting to these circumstances,” Lemierre said from Brussels. “If you think about the results of the activities of the banks, probably 2019 will be different because of the adaptation of the banking sector to these realities.”
Trading at BNP Paribas slumped at the end of last year as it lost about $80 million on derivatives trades linked to the U.S. stock market. France’s largest bank decided to close its proprietary trading unit and U.S. commodity derivatives business as part of a broader revamp.
Rival  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA is bracing for even deeper measures at its investment bank, with plans to cut 8 billion euros ($9 billion) of risk-weighted assets at its global-markets unit. Deputy CEO Severin Cabannes has told staff that top management isn’t betting on a turnaround anytime soon for the markets business."

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>","World shares hit six-month high, oil chases $70 a barrel","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets' fast start to the year continued on Tuesday as world shares inched to a six-month high, Brent oil neared $70 a barrel for the first time since November and the dollar showed renewed signs of strength. 
Some brightening of the global industrial mood – at least in China and the United States – had to compete with another dour U.S. retail sales report, Britain's broken Brexit plans and turbulence in Turkey, but it seemed to be enough.
European bourses shook off an early wobble to climb for a third day, while the S&P 500 looked set to add another few points to its best start to a year since 1998 as the MSCI world did the same.
Europe was led by a near 1 percent jump in London's FTSE 100 which was lifted by a 0.6 percent weaker pound after the UK parliament failed once again on Monday to find any alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit divorce deal.
May was hunkered down in hours of cabinet meetings with her senior ministers on Tuesday to plan her next moves, but it seemed more in hope than expectation and EU officials warned again of a 'no-deal' crash out for the UK.
It also meant investors stuck with UK Gilts, and safe-haven German bonds, negative yields notwithstanding, in the bond markets despite a pop back higher in key U.S. yields in recent days.
""It does seem that British MPs want to avoid a no-deal Brexit by all means, but they are not voting for any of the alternatives and time is running out,"" DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said.
""So I think investors have to prepare for the possibility that no-deal Brexit is on its way in 10 days' time."" 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended up 0.2 percent and at a seven-month high after also rallying more than one percent in the previous session.
Chinese bluechips scored a 10-month high, leapfrogging Colombia to the top of the leaderboard of world share markets, while Australian shares gained 0.4 percent after the Aussie dollar dropped following a meeting of the country's central bank.
The RBA held interest rates steady and highlighted the strength of employment, showing no immediate inclination to echo the outright dovish tone of some of its global peers.
Nevertheless it highlighted ""downside risks for the global growth environment"" and with elections coming soon markets were betting the RBA will ultimately be forced to ease its rates, if only to stop the Aussie dollar from rising.

OIL ON THE BOIL 
The other big shift taking place was in oil markets where prices hit fresh 2019 highs after a U.S. official said on Monday that Washington was considering more sanctions on Iran and a key Venezuelan export terminal halted operations.
U.S. crude futures traded at $61.90 per barrel, up 0.5 percent on the day while Brent futures were eyeing $70 a barrel for the first time since November at $69.19.
""China's PMI number was the most significant monthly increase since 2012, which should ease concerns around a potential threat to oil demand,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy at SPI Asset Management.
Copper and gold both ticked down in the industrial and precious metals markets but in the digital world, Bitcoin suddenly came back to life. 
It jumped more than 20 percent to touch $5,000 at one point, its highest since November. Crypto-analysts pointed to a large order in a thin market, though there wasn't any obvious trigger for the order immediately apparent. 
The upward swing pushed Bitcoin through its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than a year. The value of the unit plunged last year as global authorities tightened their regulation of the market.
The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rival currencies, rose as much as 0.3 percent to 97.430 which left the euro at $1.12, the yen at 111.37 and the pound worth $1.3030. 
In emerging markets, gains in MSCI's EM share index were capped at 0.25 percent, after currency volatility in countries such as Turkey and South Africa that were under pressure from political tension and weak local manufacturing.
The lira gave up 1.4 percent after the United States halted delivery of equipment related to the F-35 fighter aircraft, its first concrete step after Ankara pressed on with plans for a Russian-made missile defense system.
The disagreement is the latest in a series of diplomatic spats between the U.S. and Turkey, which were partly responsible for pushing the currency into crisis last year. 
It also comes after a heavy-handed clampdown on the international lira market designed to prevent big lira swings before last weekend's local elections that saw President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party lose both Istanbul and Ankara.
""A close eye will need to be kept on the level of (Turkey's)FX reserves -- US$ 71.4 bln in March-- which cover around 3 months of imports and is equal to around 40 percent of short-term foreign debt,"" analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.

Russian companies had been able to borrow cheaply abroad but have faced handicaps in raising money in the West since 2014 when Europe and the United States imposed sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukrainian crisis.
Elena Kuritsyna, Director of the Corporate Relations Department at the central bank, said that after talks with Chinese regulators, Russia in late 2018 amended its securities markets laws to help companies raise funds in China to compensate for the lack of access to European debt markets.
""We wanted to make debt raising an easier exercise for Russian companies,"" Kuritsyna told reporters, presenting the changes that the central bank had made.
The changes allow Russian companies to issue Eurobonds, or bonds denominated in currencies other than the rouble, outside Russia without the need to get permission from the Bank of Russia, Kuritsyna said.

""We see interest in this instrument, especially ... given the current geopolitical situation,"" Kuritsyna said, without giving any information on the possible amount of funds that Russian companies can or want to borrow in China.

1683,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",Pemex Is Too Big to Fail and Investors Are Finally Catching On,"(Bloomberg) -- True believers in Petroleos Mexicanos are fueling a rally in its bonds, reckoning that government support for the beleaguered state-owned company will ultimately provide a backstop from any troubles.
Investors including MetLife (NYSE:MET), Pictet and SMBC Nikko Securities say Pemex’s bonds were overly punished last year amid concerns the government isn’t doing enough to address the company’s problems. The challenge of falling production given Pemex’s $108 billion of debt and high taxes is real, but optimists argue its yields shouldn’t be much above sovereign notes.
“The ironic thing about Pemex is that the worse the credit profile deteriorates, the more it becomes a sovereign credit,” said Roger Horn, a senior emerging-markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York who is traveling to Mexico with a group of investors next week to scout opportunities.
Pemex’s benchmark bonds due in 2027 returned 4.1 percent last month, almost three times the average for a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of government and quasi-sovereign notes from emerging markets. The extra yield the notes pay above similar-maturity securities from the government has fallen to 2.5 percentage points -- still about 50 basis points over the past year’s average, but down from 2.95 percentage points in early January. The spread is as high as 5 percentage points for some euro- and peso- denominated bonds.
Mexico’s state oil producer had suffered in bond markets in recent months as some analysts and investors began to view its problems as so big that even implied government backing wasn’t enough to put their minds at ease. Generally, notes from state-owned companies -- known as quasi-sovereigns -- are seen as less risky because of the government backstop.
“Mexico’s significantly greater budgetary dependence on Pemex likely implies a greater chance of the company receiving government aid” if it needs it, according to Jaimin Patel, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who says the Mexican producer’s credit rating might be a full eight levels lower without the government backing.
Guido Chamorro, who manages $4.5 billion of assets as co-head of emerging-market hard-currency debt at Pictet, recently added to his holdings of Pemex’s 2027 bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chamorro says that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will do what it takes to shore up the company’s footing. He’s on the lookout for a rating downgrade -- S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings have said they may cut the producer’s investment-grade ranking -- because any dip in prices could be an opportunity to buy more.
“Pemex still makes money. It’s simply not allowed to keep it,” Chamorro said from London, lamenting the company’s high tax burden. Still, “default is not an issue over the foreseeable future.”
Fitch cut Pemex’s rating by two steps earlier this year to BBB-, the lowest investment grade. Moody’s has Pemex at the same level, while S&P has it two levels higher at BBB+. The company’s ratio of net debt to a measure of earnings, an indication of indebtedness, was 3.7 at the end of last year, among the highest globally.
The press departments at Pemex and Mexico’s Finance Ministry didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.
Lopez Obrador’s administration took power in December promising to rescue the company and restore its former glory. The president hails from one of Mexico’s top oil-producing states, Tabasco, where he has promised to spend $8 billion on a new refinery. He’s also granted Pemex 90 billion pesos ($4.7 billion) in tax breaks over the next six years and a 25 billion peso cash injection this year. Deputy Finance Minister Arturo Herrera has said that as much as $7 billion could be used from a stabilization fund to help the company with debt obligations over the next 18 months.
For MetLife Investment Management, the Pemex calculation is fairly simple -- money managers there just think of the oil producer and Mexico’s government as essentially the same credit, and don’t sweat the price volatility.
“We are confident that Pemex will work closely with all stakeholders to strengthen its position,” said Thomas Smith, an emerging-market portfolio manager for the firm.

1684,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>",Amazon's Latest Price Cut Leaves the Competition Unfazed,"Investing.com – Amazon.com’s third round of price reductions at Whole Foods Markets may be a signal that competition is tougher than the online giant initially thought.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said that it will cut prices on a range of produce by an average 20% from Wednesday. It’s the third round of cost cuts in just over two years since it bought the organic food retailer.
The move appears to be aimed at enhancing its Prime service in the U.S.: the company said it will double the range of Prime member deals at the grocery chain and offer deeper discounts.
While it has repeatedly said it intended to bring prices down, the move suggests that Amazon is not having things all its own way. Other big players in U.S. grocery market, such as Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or  Target  (NYSE:TGT), have all responded to Amazon’s challenge in recent quarters. Certainly, the shock and awe effect visible when it bought Whole Foods two years ago has faded: neither Amazon’s stock nor those of its competitors moved much in response to the news, although Dutch-based Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize (OTC:ADRNY), the owner of Stop & Shop and Giant Landover, fell 1.7% in early European trading.
Amazon is facing a two-way squeeze this year. It’s forecasting a slowdown in sales growth and a rise in costs – not least due to investment in its grocery stores. Its shares fell 5% at the end of January after forecasting revenue growth of between 10%-18% in the first quarter, the slowest rate in at least four years.
The shares have more than recouped those losses since, but the latest measure is a reminder that buying market share in a competitive grocery business can be an expensive business."

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",EU watchdog told to step up work on share price tool to tackle market fragmentation,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's financial services chief has told regulators to prioritize work on an instrument to collect share prices for investors to find the cheapest deals.
The instrument, known as a ""consolidated tape"", has long been a cherished goal for users of Europe's fragmented stock markets currently faced with about 20 trading venues, some offering the same stocks.
The tape distributes real time trade and quotes from trading venues in the market. The United States introduced such a tape decades ago to bolster efficiency in trading by knitting together platforms.
The EU's revised ""MiFID II"" securities rules, introduced in 2018, gave Brussels powers to appoint a provider if a private sector tape for a reasonable cost remains elusive.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is reviewing how MiFID II is working, but it told the EU's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis last week that due to Brexit, this work is being delayed by 6-24 months.
""We are currently assessing those delays by ESMA,"" Dombrovskis told the European Parliament's economic affairs committee on Tuesday.
""We will assess whether it's time to consider establishing more market transparency by means of a consolidated tape. We would like ESMA to prioritize this report. The U.S. markets have such a tape, so we would consider to introduce one in the EU."" 
He wants ESMA's report on a tape by early 2020.
It is part of a wider battle between exchanges and their biggest customers over the price of share trading data, with big funds asking Brussels to intervene.
FESE, Europe's exchanges industry body, published a report last month which it said showed bourses were not gouging customers with high charges.
The report also said that data vendors were already offering a de facto tape for prices on the bulk of the so-called ""lit"" exchanges, where prices and trades are instantly visible.
Dombrovskis said initial lessons could be drawn from MiFID.
""We intend to look at consumer protection issues, as well as take a deeper look at the operation of equities and bond markets,"" he told EU lawmakers.
Asset managers have become less willing to pay as much for research for picking stocks to buy following MiFID II, which forces some brokers to scale back their coverage of small- and medium-sized (SME) companies.

""We will assess how the unbundling of investment research from brokerage has worked out, and whether we need to adjust this unbundling rule. We have been receiving a lot of complaints, especially on the SME side in this area,"" Dombrovskis said.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 08:12AM ET</span>",Brexit leaves Ford at crossroads on long-term British plans,"By Toby Sterling
HALFWEG, Netherlands (Reuters) - Ford is spending tens of millions of euros preparing for a possible British exit from the European Union without a trade deal and has yet to decide on its longer-term plans for Britain, Ford Europe chairman Steven Armstrong said on Tuesday.
""We love being in Britain, but it has to be competitive and if it's not competitive then we'll have to take whatever actions we'll need to take to protect the business,"" Armstrong told Reuters at an event in the Netherlands.
Ford, which makes 1.3 million engines at two British locations, Bridgend and Dagenham, and cars in Germany, has warned it could face $1 billion in tariff costs in case of a so-called hard Brexit.
While the company has announced 5,000 job cuts in Germany, its second-biggest European market, it has yet to make major decisions in Britain, which is its biggest.
Armstrong said Ford was already spending tens of millions on euros on measures such as currency hedges and shifting inventory between countries. He said the best case scenario was that money spent preparing for Brexit would be ""wasted"".
Britain's departure from the EU has been pushed back from March 29 until at least April 12 or potentially much later, ruining some of the contingency plans of certain carmakers.
BMW's Mini plant in Britain is closing for four weeks and Peugeot's Vauxhall car factory for two weeks in moves planned months ago to help deal with any disruption from Brexit.
""We've been clear with the government in the UK and also in Brussels, we have to maintain frictionless trade at the borders and tariff-free trade,"" said Armstrong.
TARIFF THREAT
Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has become increasingly incredulous as a stable and attractive investment environment descends into deep political crisis.
Ford's British-built engines, which are shipped for fitting in vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere, could face delays and extra costs from a no-deal Brexit. 
""We've spent the last 40 years putting a business together that relies on cross-border trading,"" said Armstrong, who is overseeing an overhaul of Ford in Europe to refocus on its strong position in commercial vehicles and on popular European lines such as Fiesta, Britain's top-selling passenger car.
""We can't radically reshape on day one so you'd have to live with (tariffs) for a period of time,"" he said.
Armstrong said Ford has hedged against the possibility of a sharp fall in the value of the pound through the end of 2019, while stockpiling inventory would help bridge a one or two month period of potential chaos around Brexit.
""But it's impossible really to mitigate the financial impact in the longer term of no-deal,"" he said. Ford could try to pass on higher tariff costs, but that would be difficult in Britain, where a recession would mean falling sales, he added.

""We haven't really factored in completely the negative shock. There are a number of things that we would try to do but the reality is ... it would impact the whole of industry, not just Ford,"" Armstrong said.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 07:48AM ET</span>",Why some green investors are passing on Uber and Lyft,"By Ross Kerber and Heather Somerville
BOSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some environmentally focused investors are not ready to buy into  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) or Uber Technologies Inc, worried about the climate impact of this year's two most closely watched initial public offerings.
Both companies hope to push people away from car ownership and promote shared and sustainable transportation services, among their many ambitions that have already reshaped traffic in major U.S. cities.
Lyft began trading on Friday and its larger rival Uber will kick off its IPO this month, though neither has shown itself to be profitable and shares of Lyft sank below their initial price of $72 on Monday.
Academics and city planners are still studying whether the companies will help reduce carbon emissions by making better use of existing vehicle fleets, or increase them by clogging traffic and diverting riders from trains and buses.
But even as the companies argue congestion has many causes including growing city populations, some investors cite early indications that ride-hailing technology puts more, not fewer, cars on the road.
""As far as I can tell, they're actually putting more cars into the congested areas, and they're pulling business out of the transit systems,"" said Murray Rosenblith, portfolio manager of the New Alternatives Fund, which aims to make socially responsible investments.
""This is not an area where New Alternatives is going to get engaged,"" Rosenblith said.
Joshua Brockwell, a director at Azzad Asset Management, which also factors environmental issues into investment decisions, said both companies also face the issue of drivers ""deadheading,"" or driving around in between fares.
While both also aim to reduce private car ownership, he said, ""that's a not an eco-friendly goal in and of itself. It's overall 'miles traveled' and carbon emissions that count.""
Representatives for several other well-known climate-focused investors said they do not buy IPOs or were not ready to weigh in on ride-hailing, including Green Century Funds, Boston Common Asset Management and Parnassus Investments.
Research shows mixed results. A 2017 University of California at Davis study found ride-hailing boosted use of commuter rail but pulled people away from buses and light rail. In addition people often used the apps to take trips they previously made by walking, biking, taking public transit or not taking at all.
A study by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority found that about half of new congestion in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016 was from ride-hailing. Average speeds in the city stood at 20.9 miles per hour at the end of the period, researchers found, 3.1 miles per hour slower than at the start. https:// Drivers for Lyft and Uber often travel far to reach urban areas before they even turn on the app. It is common for drivers from California’s Central Valley to drive close to 100 miles (160 km) to San Francisco in search of more lucrative fares. Lyft executives including Chief Policy Officer Anthony Foxx said that the company has taken other steps to combat congestion such as showing bus arrival times on its smartphone app and investing in bicycles and scooters. Lyft also says it spent millions of dollars on carbon offsets in 2018, and supports transit infrastructure.  ""We are on a long path. We didn't get to this level of congestion in our cities overnight,"" Foxx said in an interview with Reuters. Uber did not make executives available to comment, but the company has made its own commitments to bikes, scooters and other sustainability initiatives. Its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in September promised $10 million to study ideas such as congestion pricing to speed traffic.  One opportunity is that Uber and Lyft could help drivers buy more expensive electric cars, which have a lower cost per mile. Accelerating the shift to electric could win over Seb Beloe, head of research at WHEB Asset Management in London, another investor focused on sustainability, he said via email. But he avoided the Lyft IPO and worries the service and Uber will diminish public transit. As things stand, ""we think that the case is not yet compelling"" for the companies, Beloe said.

Superdry said proxy votes cast ahead of a meeting of investors showed Dunkerton had secured 50.75 percent of the votes cast for his reappointment as a director. 
The final outcome will be declared once votes cast at the general meeting itself are included.
Dunkerton, who owns 18.4 percent of Superdry's equity, had quit the firm a year ago after a row over strategy. He particularly does not agree with Superdry's product and internet plans.
Superdry, whose main products are sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets, has issued a string of profit warnings, the latest in December, and its shares have slumped 64 percent over the last year. It has been led by Chief Executive Euan Sutherland since 2014.
Superdry's board had opposed Dunkerton's return, saying it would be highly disruptive and could trigger resignations.
Dunkerton and Superdry's co-founder and former brand and design director James Holder, who has a 9.7 percent stake, also wanted to place Peter Williams (NYSE:WMB), an industry veteran who is the current chairman of online fashion retailer Boohoo, onto the board as a non-executive director.
The proxy votes showed Williams had also won the support of 50.74 percent of votes cast.

Shares in Superdry were down 2 percent at 1114 GMT.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 06:49AM ET</span>","Microsoft, BMW launch industrial cloud technology partnership","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BMW Group on Tuesday launched an initiative to create an Open Manufacturing Platform that seeks to stimulate innovation and accelerate the development of 'smart' factories.
It's the second alliance of its kind in a week after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services teamed up to connect the German car maker's 122 group plants to improve production systems and processes.
Both deals reflect a push by 'hyperscale' cloud computing providers to capture and manage the terabytes of data thrown off by the network of connected devices such as robots and sensors that make up the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).
""Microsoft is joining forces with the BMW Group to transform digital production efficiency across the industry,"" Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Microsoft Cloud + AI Group, said of the alliance that was announced during the Hanover Messe industrial trade fair.
""Our commitment to building an open community will create new opportunities for collaboration across the entire manufacturing value chain.""
The platform will be built on the Microsoft Azure IIoT cloud platform, which BMW already uses. Its reference architecture will be based on open-source standards, an approach designed to encourage other partners to join in.
Microsoft, in a statement, said the goal was to have an initial set of four to six partners in place by the end of 2019 and a minimum of 15 initial use cases deployed in a production setting.

BMW already has 3,000 machines, robots and autonomous transport systems connected with its own IIoT platform that is built on Microsoft Azure. It said it would contribute some of its initial use cases to the project.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon weighs sale of Nigerian oil and gas fields for up to $3 billion,"By Ron Bousso and Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) recently held talks on the sale of a suite of oil and gas fields in Nigeria as the company focuses on new developments in U.S. shale and Guyana, industry and banking sources told Reuters.
The potential disposals are expected to include stakes in onshore and offshore fields and could raise up to $3 billion, two sources said.
""Exxon is actively divesting in Nigeria,"" one source who was briefed on the divestment plans said.
Exxon declined to comment.
The Irving, Texas-based company is one of the largest oil and gas producers in Nigeria, with 106 operated platforms. Its oil output in the West African country reached 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, its website says. 
Exxon officials have held talks in recent weeks with several Nigerian companies to gauge their interest in the fields. 
One source said Exxon was soon due to open a ""data room"" - which would provide technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details - in Nigeria.
The discussions focused on a number of onshore fields Exxon shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm NNPC, including oil mining leases 66, 68, 70 and 104, one source said. Exxon's share of oil production in those fields reached 120,000 bpd in 2017, the last year for which data was available. 
Exxon is also weighing the possible sale of stakes in offshore fields in Nigeria, two sources said.
It is looking into offering for sale assets in Equatorial Guinea and Chad, according to two sources.
The Nigerian government has in the last decade supported a drive by domestic firms such as Oando, Seplat and privately held Aiteo to expand their operations in the country as international companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) sought to lower their presence due to oil spills resulting from pipeline sabotage.
Exxon recently launched the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan's largest oilfield, which would mark its retreat from the former Soviet state after 25 years.
Exxon announced earlier this year plans to boost its capital spending from $26 billion in 2018 to $30 billion in 2019 and up to $35 billion next year as it seeks to develop oilfields in Guyana and the U.S. Permian basin as well as gas projects in Mozambique and the U.S. Gulf Coast.

In an analyst presentation last month, Exxon said it would accelerate its divestments to around $15 billion by 2021.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 06:09AM ET</span>",Ghosn's lawyers say his trial must be separate from Nissan's to ensure fairness,"By Tim Kelly and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Lawyers for Carlos Ghosn asked a Tokyo court on Tuesday to try the ex-Nissan Motor Co boss separately from his former employer, arguing he would otherwise not get a fair hearing to fight charges of financial wrongdoing. 
The request marks the first major legal maneuver by Ghosn's new legal team since his release on bail last month, as he faces mounting accusations of financial misconduct during his time at the helm of Nissan and partners  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors, one of the world's biggest automaking groups. 
The case has shaken the global auto industry and marked a dramatic fall from grace for an executive once lauded for his rescue of Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago.
Tokyo prosecutors have indicted Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a close associate who served as a director on Nissan's board, on financial-misconduct charges. Nissan is also included in the indictment for making false disclosures in annual securities reports, for which the company has expressed regret.
""No matter how you look at it, having Ghosn sit alongside Nissan at the trial would be peculiar, it would go against his right to a fair trial,"" his main defense lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told a briefing.
Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November after Nissan told prosecutors its own investigation uncovered evidence of his wrongdoing. He spent more than 100 days in a detention center before being released on $9 million bail last month. Ghosn, now ousted as chairman of Nissan, denies the charges, as does Kelly.
Ghosn faces criminal charges in Japan over failing to report around $82 million in salary from Nissan, and for temporarily transferring personal financial losses onto Nissan's books during the global financial crisis.
""It's right that his lawyers wouldn't want Ghosn to stand trial with Nissan. Nissan will plead guilty and that would clearly influence the mood of the trial,"" said Nobuo Gohara, a lawyer who heads Gohara Compliance and Law Office, which is not involved in the Ghosn case.
OMAN CONNECTION
Hironaka, a high-profile defense lawyer dubbed ""the razor"" for his courtroom prowess, told the briefing that his team wanted Ghosn's case separated from that of Kelly's because the American is a potential key witness for the Ghosn defense.
Tokyo prosecutors were not immediately available to comment on Ghosn's lawyers' requests. A Nissan spokesman said the company could not comment on judicial procedures. 
Hironaka also said he did not rule out the possibility of further charges against Ghosn in Tokyo.
Reuters reported on Monday that Renault had alerted French prosecutors to payments made to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman, citing three sources.
Renault has established it paid out millions of euros described as dealer incentives to Omani distributor Suhail Bahwan Automobiles (SBA) over five years from around 2011, said the sources, who were briefed on the findings. 
Hironaka told the briefing he was aware of the report but had not spoken to Ghosn about it. Ghosn's French lawyers have denied the allegations of potential embezzlement in Oman.
Nissan had previously found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to SBA.
Responding last month to earlier reports about the Nissan payments via SBA, a Ghosn family spokesman said: ""The dealer incentive payments were directed by regional heads, not the CEO, and rewarded top performing dealers around the world.""
Nissan is holding an extraordinary shareholders meeting next week to vote to remove Ghosn and Kelly as directors, and Hironaka said there was no plan to appeal if shareholders vote to depose the former executives.
An external committee reviewing governance at Nissan said last week there were enough facts to suspect violations of laws and the private use of company funds by Ghosn.

It described a corporate culture at Nissan ""in which no one can make any objections to Mr. Ghosn"", who was ""in a way deified within Nissan as a savior who had redeemed Nissan from collapse"".
