0,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 05:04PM ET</span>","During COP26, Facebook served ads with climate falsehoods, skepticism","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -Facebook advertisers promoted false and misleading claims about climate change on the platform in recent weeks, just as the COP26 conference https://www.reuters.com/business/cop was getting under way.
Days after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, touted the company's efforts to combat climate misinformation in a blog as the Glasgow summit began, conservative media network Newsmax ran an ad on Facebook that called man-made global warming a ""hoax.""
The ad, which had multiple versions, garnered more than 200,000 views. In another, conservative commentator Candace Owens said, ""apparently we're just supposed to trust our new authoritarian government"" on climate science, while a U.S. libertarian think-tank ran an ad on how ""modern doomsayers"" had been wrongly predicting climate crises for decades. 
Newsmax, Owens and the Daily Wire, which paid for the ad from Owens's page, did not respond to requests for comment. 
Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, does not have a specific policy on climate misinformation in ads or unpaid posts. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google said last month it would no longer allow ads that contradict scientific consensus on climate change on YouTube and its other services, though it would allow content that discusses false claims. 
Facebook generally does not remove misinformation in posts unless it determines they pose imminent real-world harm, as it did for falsehoods around COVID-19. The company says it demotes posts ranked as false by its third-party fact-checkers (of which Reuters is one) and prohibits ads with these debunked claims. It says advertisers that repeatedly post false information may face restrictions on their ability to advertise on Facebook. It exempts politicians' ads from fact-checks.
Asked about ads pushing climate misinformation, a company spokesperson said in a statement: ""While ads like these run across many platforms, Facebook offers an extra layer of transparency by requiring them to be available to the public in our Ad Library for up to seven years after publication.""
UK-based think-tank InfluenceMap, which identified misleading Facebook ads run from several media outlets and think-tanks around COP26, also found fossil fuel companies and lobbying groups spent $574,000 on political and social issue Facebook ads during the summit, resulting in more than 22 million impressions and including content that promoted their environmental efforts in what InfluenceMap described as ""greenwashing https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/slowly-european-regulators-turn-up-heat-greenwashing-2021-11-04.""
One ad paid for by the American Petroleum Institute panned over a natural landscape as it touted its efforts to tackle climate change, while BP (NYSE:BP) America ran an ad detailing its support for climate-friendly policies in neon green writing. 
""Our social media posts represent a small fraction compared to the robust investments our companies make every day into breakthrough technologies aimed at capturing methane, advancing hydrogen and accelerating carbon capture,"" the API said in a statement, saying the natural gas and oil industry was committed to lowering emissions. BP said in a statement that it was ""actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, through a range of transparent channels, including social media advertising.""
Oil and gas companies have placed ads across a broad range of other media properties ahead of and during the COP26 summit, including on podcasts, newsletters and through TV commercials. In Europe, Greenpeace and other environmental groups called last month for a ban on adverts and sponsorships by oil and gas firms. 
Facebook has started adding informational labels to posts about climate change to direct users to its Climate Science Center, a new hub with facts and quizzes which it says is visited by more than 100,000 people a day.
Asked in an interview aired this week at the Reuters Responsible Business USA 2021 https://reutersevents.com/events/rbs-usa event where he thought Facebook still fell short on climate issues, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer said, ""Obviously, there's been concern about people sharing misinformation about climate on Facebook.""
""I'm not going to say we have it right at any moment in time,"" he said. ""We continually reevaluate what the state of the world is and what is our role, which starts with trying to allow people free expression, and then intervening when there are harms happening that we can prevent.""
He did not directly answer why Facebook had not banned all climate misinformation ads but said it ""didn't want people to profit over misinformation.""
EMPLOYEES QUESTION POLICY
The company's approaches to climate misinformation and skepticism have caused employee debate. Discussions on its internal message board show staff sparring over how it should handle climate misinformation and flagging instances of it on the platform, such as in a January post where an employee said they found ""prominent results of apparent misinformation"" when they searched for climate change in its video 'Watch' section. 
The documents were among a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left in May. Reuters was among a group of news organizations able to view the documents.
In the comments on an April post highlighting Facebook's commitment to reducing its own environmental impact, including by reaching net zero emissions for its global operations last year, one staff member asked if the company could start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from its platforms. 

Two external researchers working with Facebook on its climate change efforts told Reuters they would like to see the company approach climate misinformation with the same proactiveness it has for COVID-19, which Facebook cracked down on during the pandemic.
""It does need to be addressed with the same level of urgency,"" said John Cook, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University who is advising Facebook on its climate misinformation work. ""It is arguably more dangerous.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday said it assessed $3.9 billion in fines related to enforcement actions in fiscal 2021, down from a record $4.7 billion in 2020, even as standalone actions increased. 
The top U.S. markets regulator said it assessed $1.4 billion in penalties and another $2.4 billion in ill-gotten funds disgorged through 697 actions. That compared with $1 billion in penalties and $3.6 billion in disgorgement across 715 cases in 2020.
Standalone enforcement actions increased to 434 from 405 previously, but remained below the prior five-year average, the annual report said. In fiscal 2020, a handful of sizeable cases drove the bulk of the agency's collections.
The SEC brought a series of first-of-their kind actions, including the first case against a decentralized finance (DeFi) firm, fraud charges against an alternative data provider and securities law violations on the ""dark web,"" according to the report.
The year's actions included a large resolution with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in which the company agreed to pay about $1 billion to settle SEC charges related to the 1MDB scandal, an accounting controls case against  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and charges against Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and two former executives related to a years-long expense management scheme. 

The SEC also brought a rare litigated case against AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and three executives for allegedly disclosing material nonpublic information to research analysts.
The SEC said it doled out a record $564 million to 108 whistleblowers in fiscal 2021.

Moreover, massive investment in the industry for the discovery and manufacture of viable therapies for several critical diseases should keep its momentum going. Given the industry’s growth prospects, Wall Street analysts expect the low-priced stocks of budding companies 22nd Century (NASDAQ:XXII), UpHealth (UPH), and Talkspace (TALK) to rally by more than 35% in the near term. So, let’s discuss these names.The discovery of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, the development of integrated medical diagnostic devices and solutions, virtual consultations, and treatments and therapies for other critical diseases have all helped the healthcare industry grow significantly and garner investor attention. This is evidenced by the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLV) 20.3% returns over the past year.
Furthermore, while the historically high inflation and ongoing volatility in the broader market could lead to loss of value by many large-cap stocks, the inelastic demand for healthcare products and services should help shares of many industry participants perform steadily.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the upside potential of budding low-priced stocks in this space—22nd Century Group, Inc. (XXII), UpHealth, Inc. (UPH), and Talkspace, Inc. (TALK). These stocks are expected to rally in price by more than 35% in the near term.

“We continue to believe its a matter of when, not if, Apple enters the EV race and this will add another $30+ per share of TAM [total addressable market] to the Apple growth story over the next few years given the golden age of EV transformation on the horizon,” Wedbush said in a note.

Investing.com —  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) shares have been upgraded for the second time in a week after JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman raised them to overweight from neutral based on a ""fairly defined catalyst path.""
In a research note, the analyst told investors that the first ""critical"" catalyst is China's MAX certification, which should happen soon. But, unwittingly for Seifman, it may come even sooner than he expected — a few hours after the JPMorgan note, Chinese media company Caixin Global reported that the Chinese regulator is satisfied with Boeing's proposed 737 Max fixes.
Boeing shares hit a high of $231.50 earlier in the day, but closed up just 0.26% at $227.20.
The second catalyst for Seifman is the 787 delivery halt, which is likely to extend into 2022.
""Beyond these two items, there are things Boeing can do in the coming quarters to give confidence to investors, such as reliably delivering more 737s (and eventually 787s) than it produces, winning aircraft orders, and generating cash. We expect these things to occur, but some have been pushed out, so we do not take them for granted,"" Seifman explained.
The analyst, who also raised Boeing's price target to $275 per share from the prior $260, said there is a tendency to expect big jumps in BA, given the current catalysts, but there is tough work ahead for the company.
""Boeing’s position at the center of global air travel offers confidence that it will recover financially over time and we believe risk-reward now skews favorably,” Seifman concluded."

Applied Materials announced earnings per share of $1.94 on revenue of $6.12 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.96 on revenue of $6.38 billion.
Applied Materials shares are up 83% from the beginning of the year, still down 0.19% from its 52 week high of $159.00 set on November 16. They are outperforming the Nasdaq 100 which is up 27.89% from the start of the year.
Applied Materials shares lost 6.68% in after-hours trading following the report.
The company's President and CEO, Gary Dickerson, put the revenue and earnings miss, like many companies, down to supply chain issues, explaining that it is unable to keep up with demand.
“Demand for semiconductors and equipment continues to grow as the pandemic accelerates digital transformation of the economy, and currently, our supply chain cannot keep up,” said Dickerson.
“We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near-term, and managing these constraints in partnership with our suppliers and chipmakers is our top priority.”
In its outlook, the company took into account the supply chain issues it is currently experiencing, forecasting, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, net sales to be approximately $6.16 billion, plus or minus $250 million. In addition, adjusted earnings are expected to be between $1.78 to $1.92.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite edged higher on Thursday and appeared on track to set new records with a half hour of trading left.
Big tech notched gains, lifted by chip makers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which roared to new highs after strong earnings and a positive outlook.
Broad gains in chip-making stocks boosted the Philadelphia semiconductor index itself to a record high. And ongoing strong earnings by retailers such asMacy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) also supported the index gains. 
Still, inflationary pressures remained a worry, and investors were still skittish about how the Federal Reserve might act to reverse rising prices. On a positive front, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell again last week, but the pace of the decline didn’t match expectations.
Before President Joe Biden leaves for his Thanksgiving break, there are still a number of unresolved matters in Washington. House lawmakers were expected to bring his $1.85 trillion social spending package to a vote by the end of this week. And leadership from both parties are meeting to negotiate a solution to the debt ceiling, which must be raised by early December.
Biden also has to pardon the Thanksgiving turkeys.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1.  Pfizer  still in the headlines
Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)continues to draw the spotlight -- as we await public health officials’ decision on providing boosters for all adults. The U.S. government will pay it $5.29 billion to buy 10 million treatment courses of its experimental drug for treating Covid-19.
The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the pill, and the supplies, to be completed by 2022, will start once that is in. The company said it has also entered into advance purchase agreements with several other countries and has initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 nations around the world.
2. Macy’s earnings
Macy’s Sales and earnings both blew past estimates and the retailer raised its guidance for the full year once more, after attracting 4.4 million new customers through the three months ended October 30, on top of the 5 million it added in the second quarter. 
The company now expects its full-year net sales to be $24.20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up from $23.75 billion previously.  Average customer spending rose 16% across three segments of its loyalty program -- platinum, gold and silver. Separately, Macy's said it will launch a curated online marketplace to cement the gains it has made in e-commerce over the last couple of years.  
3. Chip-Automaker alliance
 Globalfoundries  Inc (NASDAQ:GFS) made its public debut at the end of October and hit new highs Thursday after announcing a collaboration with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). The companies will work together to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the U.S. GlobalFoundries create an additional semiconductor supply for Ford's current vehicle lineup.

Read on.After a series of solid retail earnings reports recently, market bull Jim Cramer does not see stagflation in the U.S. economy. “There’s nothing stagnant about this economy. In fact, retailers may be experiencing their strongest quarter in history,” Cramer asserted recently.
Unemployment woes appear to be subsiding, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting 531,000 new jobs added in October and strong private payroll gains. In addition, President Biden signed a long-awaited trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill into law recently, which could boost the U.S. economy further. The spending package should not add to inflation worries while stimulating the economy, because spending from it is expected to be stretched over a long period.
Cyclical stocks tend to reflect broader economic performance. Thus, ETFs with exposure to cyclical sectors—Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY), iShares US Consumer Discretionary ETF (IYC), SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), and Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (RCD)—should perform well.

Much of the demand is being fueled by millennials and generation Z consumers, who are more than willing to spend on sustainable products that are also healthy.
Sweetgreen's shares opened at $52, compared to the IPO price of $28 a share, which was well above its targeted price range of between $23 and $25.
The Los Angeles, California-based company raised $364 million on Wednesday, selling 13 million shares in an upsized initial public offering, compared with its original plan of 12.5 million. 
Founded by three college graduates in 2007, Sweetgreen operates 140 restaurants in 13 states in the United States. It offers ""earth-friendly"" meals made with seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients. 
The company's revenue rose to $243.4 million in the nine months ended September from $161.4 million a year earlier, while loss narrowed to $87 million from $100 million.
E-commerce channels accounted for 68% of Sweetgreen's total revenue in the last 12 months.
Eleven food and beverage companies went public so far this year to raise nearly $3.83 billion, Dealogic data showed, as firms tapped a boom in the IPO market. 

Greek yogurt maker Chobani on Wednesday made public its paperwork for an IPO that Reuters reported could value the company at over $10 billion, while plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods Inc is also preparing for a listing.

Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surged to record highs Thursday, as the tech giant is reportedly accelerating plans to develop its self-driving electric vehicle after reaching a key milestone. 
Apple was up more than 2.8% surpassing its previous all-time high of $157.87.
The company recently reached a key milestone in developing the car’s underlying self-driving system, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation. The chip would be used in the first generation of the car.
Apple is internally targeting a launch of its self-driving car in four years, faster than the five- to seven-year timeline that some engineers had been planning for earlier this year, according to the report. 
Some on Wall Street are forecasting that entry into the EV market could add at least $30 per share to the Apple’s share price.
“We continue to believe its a matter of when, not if, Apple enters the EV race and this will add another $30+ per share of TAM [total addressable market] to the Apple growth story over the next few years given the golden age of EV transformation on the horizon,” Wedbush said in a note.
Wedbush rates Apple's chances of the unveiling its own car at own standalone car by 2025 at 60% to 65%, and suggests that a strategic partnership with one of the major automakers could present the way forward for Apple's foray into the EV space as building factories are capital as well as margin intensive.
""The company has been working in Cupertino for years around this autonomous vision and we believe a potential larger strategic partnership with an established auto player such as Hyundai, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), GM, Ford, or VW would be a golden partnership for the next decade tapping into this EV opportunity,"" the firm wrote."

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and other brokerages of wrongly preventing retail investors from buying fast-rising ""meme stocks,"" triggering a sell-off.
In a decision on Wednesday, Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga of the federal court in Miami found no proof of an illegal conspiracy to cut off social media-fueled trading of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc,  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) and six other stocks.
Investors in the proposed class action said the brokerages and Citadel Securities LLC colluded to halt a ""short squeeze"" that was causing billions of dollars of losses for Citadel and hedge funds that were betting on falling stock prices.
The investors said the late January trading curbs left them ""no option"" but to sell at plummeting prices.
But Altonaga said in her 51-page decision that the investors fell ""far short"" of providing direct evidence of an antitrust conspiracy, despite emails among senior Robinhood and Citadel executives that lent ""some credence"" to their claims.
""(A)re a few vague and ambiguous emails between two firms in an otherwise lawful, ongoing business relationship enough to nudge plaintiffs' claims across the line from conceivable to plausible?"" Altonaga wrote. ""The court thinks not.""
Altonaga also dismissed related claims against E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp and four other defendants.
Frank Schirripa, a lawyer for the investors, said on Thursday they were disappointed but expected to amend their complaint in the next few weeks.
Robinhood said in a statement: ""This further confirms that the conspiracy theory of collusion has no basis in fact.""
Citadel said it was pleased with the decision. E*Trade declined to comment. A separate proposed class action accuses Robinhood of negligence.
The meme stock frenzy has been fueled by investors using online forums such as Reddit and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Many traded from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, through brokerages that had eliminated trading commissions.

Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a report that markets essentially worked well during the volatility. The regulator did not suggest policy changes.

Best known for its chain of drugstores in more than 9,900 locations, the company has been working to expand its services since it acquired health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET) in 2018.
CVS said that as part of its strategic review it would create an enhanced version of its health hubs that offer treatment for common ailments as well as chronic care to add more customers.
The reduction in stores will result in CVS taking an impairment charge of between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
As part of the new strategy, the company also created a new position of chief pharmacy officer and appointed executive vice president of specialty pharmacy and product innovation Prem Shah to the role.
""We see this as consistent with our expected LT (long-term) strategy for CVS, moving to grow managed care and care delivery, while shrinking legacy bricks-and-mortar retail business,"" said Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes in a note.

(Reuters) -A majority of Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co's striking workers on Wednesday voted to approve a modified contract proposed by the farm equipment maker, ending a near six-week strike.
The United Auto Workers members of Deere ratified a six-year agreement by a vote of 61% to 39%, the union said. Deere said it has been informed that workers will resume operations on Wednesday evening.
The settlement is a relief to the agriculture industry that is already grappling with parts shortages and a tight labor market amid the U.S. corn and soybean harvest season.
Deere said last week it made ""modest modifications"" to its second proposal that was rejected by 55% of the UAW workers earlier this month. The company and the union did not elaborate on the modifications.
Workers at facilities in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas have been on strike since the middle of October after having turned down Deere's attempts to tie them down to a new deal, prompting the company to say ""all options are on the table"".

The workers demanded better pay from Deere, which forecast a record net income of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion this year, to claw back concessions they made on some benefits in the past.
Deere has so far refused to comment on the impact of the strike on production. Bernstein analyst Chad Dillard expects the company to forecast fiscal 2022 net income below Wall Street estimates, in part due to the strike impact, when it reports results next Wednesday.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) raised key profitability and cost targets on Thursday and said it would add 10 million customers by 2024, banking on growth in places such as Mexico and Turkey, yet its shares fell on concerns about its emerging market exposure.
BBVA, like Santander (MC:SAN), is struggling to earn money from more mature markets in Europe and has been expanding in emerging markets, where it sees greater growth.
Chairman Carlos Torres said at BBVA's first investor day in 14 years that the bank's strategy was predicated on a more benign global economic outlook and with the ""worst of the pandemic behind us, growth is back"".
BBVA outlined its 2022-2024 plans just a few days after it offered to buy the rest of Garanti for up to 2.25 billion euros ($2.6 billion), taking advantage of a slide in the Turkish lira.
The bank said it expected its return on tangible equity (ROTE) to rise to 14% by the end of 2024 from 11.7%, and its cost-to-income ratio to fall to 42% from 44.7%, even while keeping up investments in digital banking. 
But its shares closed down 5.5%, against a 1% fall on the European STOXX banking index.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said that while welcoming the ROTE target hike, they saw potential headwinds due to BBVA's exposure to emerging-market currencies, particularly Mexico and Turkey. 
BBVA's Chief Executive Onur Genc played down concerns and told Reuters that the investment would pay off.
""We are just spending 1.4 billion euros in terms of capital when Garanti has been delivering 1.2 billion profits every year over the last six years,"" Genc said.
MEXICO TO DRIVE GROWTH
BBVA also said it expected revenues at its unit in Mexico, which make up more than 40% of its profit, to achieve an almost double-digit accumulated growth by 2024, while revenues in Turkey, which will make up to 25% of group earnings from 14% now, would grow in the high teens.
To weather the pandemic, BBVA sold its U.S. business last year, generating more than 8 billion euros in excess capital to focus on cost-cutting in Spain and shareholder returns.
""We will continue to cut costs in Spain but we don't need to do another round of layoffs,"" Genc said in an interview. 
Taking into account a full take-up of the Garanti offer and a 3.5 billion euro share buy-back to be launched early next week, BBVA's excess capital was around 2.2 billion euros.
Although BBVA called off merger talks with Sabadell a year ago, a deal is still widely viewed as an option given BBVA's solid solvency buffers.
Asked about Sabadell, Torres said: ""who knows what the future may bring"".

BBVA also unveiled a new dividend distribution policy of between 40% and 50% of ordinary profit, compared to a previous 35% to 40% payout. This would be implemented with the possibility of combining cash distributions and share buy-backs.
The bank reaffirmed its target for fully-loaded CET1 of between 11.5% to 12%. With the Garanti deal and the share buyback, this capital ratio stands at 12.72%.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler will produce the first in-house electric motor at its oldest plant in Berlin, the carmaker said on Thursday, providing relief to workers worried that the diesel motor production site was on the brink of deep job cuts.
Workers who feared for their positions after Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said in September 2020 its Berlin site would end production of the 6-cylinder diesel motor within a year would also be offered retraining in software and coding, the German company said.
Around 450 of the plant's 2,300-odd workers have applied to attend a pilot 160-hour training course in software development, works council chairman Michael Rahmel said on a press call, with around fifteen selected for the first round of training.
Investment in the 120-year-old Berlin-Marienfelde plant, previously pinned at a two-digit million euro amount, will rise to a low three-digit million euro amount in the next six years, Daimler said. 
The motor, known as an axial-flux motor and designed by the British startup YASA which Daimler acquired earlier this year, weighs a fraction of its diesel equivalent and can boost the range of an EV by up to 7%, YASA's founder Tim Woolmer told Reuters in July.
Woolmer said at the time that Daimler had briefed YASA to bring costs down in future iterations of its motor so the carmaker could use them across its entire EV range.
The e-motor is simpler to produce than its diesel equivalent, meaning the plant will eventually require less workers - but the exact number of future job losses was not yet clear, head of production Joerg Burzer said on a press call. A start date for production of the motor was not provided.
The digital training campus, which Daimler partnered with Siemens in March to develop and which will go live in 2022, would also create new jobs, Burzer said.
""If we make an effort here in coming years, there could even be more jobs than before,"" head of IG Metall Berlin Jan Otto said.
Production of the 6-cylinder diesel motor and some components would continue at the factory in the short-term but was being wound down, Burzer and union representatives said.

The factory's employees are guaranteed their positions until the beginning of 2030 under an existing union agreement.
""A year ago, we didn't know what would happen at the plant. Today we're embarking on what will hopefully be a successful transformation with our heads held high,"" Michael Rahmel, works council chairman at Berlin-Marienfelde, said in a statement.

Furthermore, with the holiday season fast approaching, this momentum is expected to continue. That is why we think it could be wise to now bet on fundamentally sound hotel stocks InterContinental Hotels (IHG), Choice Hotels (NYSE:CHH), and Wyndham Hotels (WH). Read on.The hotel industry was severely impacted by COVID-19 pandemic-induced travel restrictions and social distancing rules. However, because solid progress on the vaccination front has helped contain the spread of the virus in several parts of the world this year, the industry seems set for a solid rebound.
On November 8, the Biden administration announced the lifting of the U.S.’ international travel ban for vaccinated tourists after nearly 18 months. This should be a catalyst for the travel and tourism industry. According to AAA, travel volume is expected to rise to within 5% of 2019 levels this Thanksgiving, with some 53.40 million people taking to the air, roads, and rails.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality hotel stocks InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG), Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH), and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (WH). They are expected to perform well this quarter and beyond as travel picks up.

(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are weighing a bill that would allow soybean oil-based jet fuel to qualify for an unprecedented tax credit, a win for biofuel producers and a blow to environmental groups that say crop-based materials undermine the benefits of making greener fuels.
The White House has set ambitious targets to lower aviation emissions by 20% by 2030 and has touted sustainable aviation fuel, which is currently made in small quantities from used cooking oil and animal fat, as a means to hit those targets.
While numerous industries are pursuing ways to decarbonize vehicle use, some modes of transport, like heavy trucking and aviation, are viewed as difficult to convert to electric power.
Biofuel groups say it will be impossible to meet such targets without utilizing ethanol and soybean oil and want the current model for determining eligibility for the tax credit to be changed.
Some environmental groups, however, argue that increased demand for crops causes land, including rain forests, to be cleared in the United States and abroad.
Petroleum refiners have ramped up production of green fuels, supported by tax credits such as the biofuel blenders tax credit and various low-carbon fuel standards.
An early version of the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better bill currently being negotiated in Congress drew criticism from U.S. farmers and the growing sustainable aviation fuel industry. They opposed a clause that said producers would have to demonstrate a carbon score at least 50 percent better than the fossil fuel alternative, based on a model developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
ICAO's land-use penalties are three times higher than the leading U.S. model, known as GREET.
The latest version of the bill, updated on November 3, specifies the fuel production pathway could be ""similar to that"" adopted by ICAO, but also satisfies criteria under the Clean Air Act. It could be achieved by allowing fuels including soy-based jet fuel, as well as others.
""This leaves the door open for soy-derived SAF and threatens to undermine the climate benefits of a SAF credit,"" said Nikita Pavlenko, senior researcher with the International Council on Clean Transportation Fuels team. He added that ethanol-based fuel seemed less likely to meet ICAO or GREET standards.

The latest version of the Build Back Better legislation puts tax credits for SAF between $1.25 to $1.75 a gallon, depending on the feedstock used.
The changes could mean U.S. petroleum refiners will consider producing more sustainable aviation fuel at scale. Oil companies like Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have been relying on soybean oil as a primary feedstock for renewable refining projects and have bought soybean crushing plants to ensure enough supply, with soybean prices soaring.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday urged Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler to investigate a planned merger between former U.S. President Donald Trump's social media company and a blank-check firm for potential violations of securities laws.
Trump Media and Technology Group may have privately held merger discussions with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Digital World Acquisition Corp but did not disclose them in its SEC filings or other public documents, the letter said.
A media report stated that Patrick Orlando, the chief executive officer of the blank-check firm, may have held discussion with Trump as early as March, months prior to the SPAC's initial regulatory filing in May and its public offering in September.
A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment, saying ""We don’t comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.""
Regulatory filings by Digital World between May 25 and Sept. 8 stated that the company has not, nor has anyone on its behalf, held any discussion with potential targets.
""The reports about DWAC and Trump Media and Technology Group appear to be a textbook example of a SPAC misleading shareholders and the public about materially important information,"" Warren said in her letter.
Warren, who has requested a response to the letter by Nov. 29, added that the omission has the potential of trapping retail investors in a stock bubble while enriching the SPAC's sponsors and the leadership of its target.
SPACs, shell companies which are formed with the intent of merging with a private company to take it public, are required to disclose any direct or indirect discussions with potential targets.

Both Trump Media and Digital World were not immediately available for comment.
The deal, announced in October, would create a social media app, TRUTH Social, which Trump said would ""stand up to Big Tech"" companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

34,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 01:02PM ET</span>",Canadian banks' lending recovery seen clouded by hot inflation,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Surging inflation and rising bond yields are set to offer a shot in the arm for Canadian banks' profit margins, which have languished during the pandemic, but an aggressive response by central banks could derail a nascent lending recovery and increase defaults, investors and analysts said. 
Canadian banks' loan growth outside of mortgages all but disappeared during the pandemic as lockdowns and surging deposits slowed consumer and business borrowing. Although spending has increased after lockdowns were lifted, that has so far failed to translate into robust credit growth.
Higher interest rates drive banks' net interest margins. But uncertainty around how persistent inflation will be and how quickly rates will rise is clouding the outlook for lending recovery into next year that investors had hoped for.
""If (the Bank of Canada and U.S. Federal Reserve) raise rates too quickly, that would stifle economic growth, and loan demand will decline. ... That would be a negative for the banks and have a negative impact on profitability,"" said Rob Colangelo, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service.
An aggressive response would raise loan servicing costs, raising the potential for defaults. Banks would increase bad loan provisions, which would lead to weaker profit growth. 
And given the recent surge in demand for variable-rate mortgages, a rapid rise in rates would make borrowers more vulnerable, potentially leading to loan losses, said Mike Driscoll, head of North American financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar.
The latest data showed inflation surged to a near two-decade high of 4.7% in October. While money markets expect a hike as soon as March and five in all next year, the Bank of Canada reiterated this week that increases are not expected until the middle quarters of 2022.
""Grocery prices, cars, everything that people buy is getting more expensive,"" Driscoll added. ""While wages may be increasing, real wages are declining. Given the high debt loads ... that can be problematic. There could be higher credit losses.""
As the pandemic recedes, investors are hoping banks' profit growth would once again come from core lending operations, rather than from releasing bad debt reserves that have driven better-than-expected earnings in the past year, and other businesses like wealth management and capital markets. 
To be sure, most analysts and investors don't expect the central bank to raise rates so quickly and abruptly that it derails the economic recovery. But if the Bank of Canada delays hikes, and inflation persists and seeps into wages, it may not have a choice, some investors said.
""We assume that if inflation continues to be elevated well above the target range, (the central bank) could be forced to act,"" Colangelo said.

An overnight rate ""pushing 3%"" is the point that could choke off economic growth and possibly prompt a recession, said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel.
""A recession is unambiguously bad for the banks. ... You get credit losses, and it chokes off loan demand,"" he said. ""I think it's unlikely, but the risk isn't zero.""

Investing.com — Semiconductor manufacturing firm GlobalFoundries Inc (NASDAQ:GFS), which made its public debut at the end of October, has seen its shares hit new highs Thursday after announcing a collaboration with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).
The companies will work together to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the U.S.
The companies have signed an agreement that will see GlobalFoundries create an additional semiconductor supply for Ford's current vehicle lineup. They will also run joint research and development to assess the growing demand for so-called ""feature-rich chips"" to support the automotive industry, including semiconductor solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, battery management systems, and in-vehicle networking.
""It's critical that we create new ways of working with suppliers to give Ford – and America – greater independence in delivering the technologies and features our customers will most value in the future,"" said Jim Farley, Ford's president and CEO.
The aim is to boost chip supplies for Ford and the U.S. automotive industry after it was hit this year by a shortage resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The shortage severely affected the global automotive industry, with the manufacturing facilities of several companies having to suspend production.
However, Morgan Stanley told investors this week that the shortage for the industry is nearly over, with Malaysian fabrication plants back to 100%.
GlobalFoundries stock currently rose 3% above Wednesday's close at $64.59, touching a new high of $67.39 earlier in the session."

MILAN (Reuters) - Iveco will focus on zero-emission trucks and buses and aim to act like a nimble startup as its owner CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) prepares to spin off the unit to concentrate on farm machinery and construction equipment.
In an investor presentation on Thursday Chief Executive-designate Gerrit Marx said Iveco should be seen as a ""150-year-old startup"" able to ""outthink and outsmart"" larger competitors.
CNH's spin-off move mirrors a similar one by Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), whose truck operations will list next month, and follows the 2019 listing of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s truck unit Traton.
Traton this year snapped up U.S. truckmaker Navistar (NYSE:NAV) as the sector consolidates in the face of the costly challenges of developing both fully-electric models for short-haul trucks and hydrogen fuel cells for longer distance trucks.
Iveco is Europe's second-largest player in the medium-sized commercial vehicle segment after Daimler, 2020 data provided by lobby group ACEA showed, but it lags competitors in the heavy-duty commercial vehicle market.
In its listing prospectus Iveco, which also makes specialty and defence vehicles as well as powertrains, said its spin-off from CNH would help both participate in consolidation.
Marx told a press conference Iveco would look with interest at partnerships in Asia that gave it the opportunity to share technology, mutually supply components or pursue joint development projects.
""That is a collaboration on a global scale that makes sense ... that's pretty much what we've set ourselves up for,"" he said answering a question on possible interest from South Korea's Hyundai and China's Geely.
Shares in CNH closed down 1.2%, bucking a 0.6% rise in Milan's blue-chip index.
CNH shareholders will receive one Iveco share for every five CNH shares. Analysts estimate Iveco could fetch a market value of around 4 billion euros.
Banca Akros analyst Gabriele Gambarova said Iveco was on track on emissions and finance services, and was strong on defence vehicles and on powertrains.
""Still, my feeling is that small size and low margins make it an M&A target,"" he said.
Iveco said on Thursday it will develop a range of fully-electric buses by 2023 and a new range of electric and fuel-cell heavy-duty trucks by 2024.
A latecomer to electric trucks, Iveco has set up a joint venture with U.S. group Nikola to produce battery electric vehicles, starting with the Nikola Tre heavy truck and hydrogen fuel cell trucks from the end of 2023.
Iveco is targeting revenue of between 16.5-17.5 billion euros ($18.7-$19.8 billion) by 2026, a compound annual growth rate of 5% versus 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
CNH shareholders are due to approve the demerger on Dec. 23, paving the way for Iveco shares to start trading on Jan. 3.

And it forecast an adjusted operating profit margin for industrial activities of 5.0-6.0% in 2026, up from 3.6% in 2019.
It is targeting free cash flow of 500 million euros in 2026, up from 30 million in 2019.($1 = 0.8819 euros)

While the company reported solid year-over-year growth in its most recent quarter, it missed Wall Street’s expectations. The stock dipped in price following the earnings release. So, the question is, considering DIS’ stretched valuation, should one buy it on the recent dip? Read on.Leading entertainment company Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) operates parks, media and entertainment distribution, and three content groups—studios, general entertainment, and sports—that are focused on developing and producing content for DTC, theatrical and linear platforms. Shares of this Burbank, Calif.-based media giant are down 13.2% in price year-to-date. Over the past month, the stock has slumped 10.8% to close yesterday’s trading session at $157.33. Furthermore, the stock is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Several operational disruptions have taken a toll on the company due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns that necessitated the closure of its theme parks and suspension of its cruise line departures. The company incurred significant revenue losses. However, its Disney+ streaming service thrived. The ""Black Widow"", which debuted on Disney+, took in $80 million in domestic box office receipts in its opening weekend, making it the biggest premiere since the pandemic began.
DIS shares plummeted 7% in price on November 11, marking it their worst session since June 2020, after the company reported a slowdown in subscriber growth for its streaming service. The company also missed consensus estimates for its top and bottom lines in its last reported quarter. Disney added 2.1 million Disney+ subscribers to hit 118.1 million, in line with CEO Bob Chapek's prediction of “low single-digit millions” of fourth-quarter streaming subscribers back in September. Also, DIS is facing competitive threats from Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

(Reuters) -European shares ended lower on Thursday, weighed by weakness in commodity-related stocks amid declining oil and metal prices, and breaking a record-breaking six-day rally fuelled by strong earnings. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 0.5%, its first fall in seven sessions, with energy stock and miners dropping about 2% each. 
Oil stocks were hit by plunging crude prices on worries of a supply overhang and the prospect of China moving to release strategic fuel reserves, while miners slipped as copper prices fell to their lowest in more than a month. [O/R] [MET/L]
European stocks started the day on stable footing, with Germany's DAX, Switzerland's SMI and France's CAC 40 all touching record highs earlier in the session, but giving up those gains by the close. 
Stronger-than-expected earnings season and accommodative monetary policy have helped drive the STOXX 600 to record highs recently. However, uncertainty has crept in about a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the extent of lockdowns needed to curb the spread of the disease.
""Speculation over a Christmas lockdown in the UK does raise risks for stocks, but questions over how wide-reaching such measures would be does bring uncertainty over who the winners and losers would be in such an instance,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.
Latest Refinitiv data shows profits of companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to rise 60.4% in the third quarter to 103.6 billion euros ($117.2 billion) from a year earlier, a dip from last week's 60.7% estimate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted unanimously on Thursday to require wireless carriers to allow texting to the new ""988"" U.S. National Suicide Prevention hotline that will begin use by July 2022.
""For individuals in crisis, text messaging can make it easier to contact a crisis counselor by allowing for a certain level of anonymity rather than engaging in a phone conversation,"" the FCC said in a statement.
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said ""millions of us, but especially young people and those with disabilities, are more likely to text than call when they are in crisis. The bottom line is it shouldn’t matter if you make a voice call or send a text message because we should connect people in crisis to the resources they need, no matter how they communicate.""
The ""988"" three-digit code will direct calls to the existing suicide prevention helpline (800) 273-8255, which will also remain in service. There is a separate Veterans Crisis Line that people can reach at (800)273-8255 and will be able to reach through 988.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said U.S. suicide rates increased 33% between 1999 and 2019.
Deaths by suicide declined by 5.6%, from 47,511 to 44,834, between 2019 and 2020, according to early CDC data published by the JAMA medical journal.
In 2019, 12 million American adults seriously thought about suicide, 3.5 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.4 million attempted suicide, the CDC said.
The suicide prevention line consists of a national network of approximately 180 crisis centers linked by the toll-free number. In 2020, a total of 2.2 million calls were answered.
The FCC noted that some major carriers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), are making ""988"" available ahead of the deadline.

The shift to ""988"" has impacted some local calling.
Starting last month, wireless users in many parts of the United States had to include the area code when dialing a local number.

(Reuters) -Unilever Plc has agreed to sell its global tea business to CVC Capital Partners for 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion), concluding a process of reviewing and spinning off the division that took more than two years. 
The business being sold, called Ekaterra, hosts a portfolio of 34 tea brands including Lipton, PG Tips, Pukka Herbs and TAZO and generated revenues of 2 billion euros in 2020. 
Unilever (NYSE:UL) will, however, retain its India and Indonesia tea operations as well as its bottled tea joint venture with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). 
Ekaterra will be sold to CVC's Capital Fund VIII on a cash and debt free basis in a process that is expected to conclude in the second half of 2022, Unilever said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.
The Financial Times earlier reported https://www.ft.com/content/83529b44-f290-4668-a766-5559dfec431c on the sale. 
""The evolution of our portfolio into higher growth spaces is an important part of our growth strategy for Unilever. Our decision to sell ekaterra demonstrates further progress in delivering against our plans,"" Unilever's CEO Alan Jope said. 
The sale relieves Unilever of a business that has been a drag on earnings for several years as demand for black tea waned and consumer tastes changed.
Jope has been under some pressure to turn around Unilever as its stock languishes and it struggles to compete in the face of high inflationary costs, especially in emerging markets, its biggest source of revenue.
Jope's plan is to focus on higher growth areas such as plant-based foods, nutrition and premium beauty to boost sales growth. 

The company last month reported stronger-than-expected quarterly organic sales but warned that inflationary pressures would only worsen in 2022. 
Unilever's shares were marginally lower in late afternoon trading.($1 = 0.8814 euros)

47,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>","Tesla, electric SUVs get poor scores from Consumer Reports","By Joseph White
(Reuters) -Vehicles from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and electric sport utilities from rival brands are among the least reliable models sold in the United States, a reflection of the risks of new technology, Consumer Reports said on Thursday.
Consumer Reports, a nonprofit organization that evaluates products and services, said Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, ranked 27th out of 28 brands, just ahead of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's Lincoln brand.
""Electric SUVs as a vehicle category is the absolute bottom in terms of reliability,"" Consumer Reports director of vehicle testing Jake Fisher said Thursday during a presentation to the Detroit Automotive Press Association.
Among electric SUVs, Fisher said  Ford Motor Co 's Mustang Mach-E ""is the only one with above-average reliability.""
Consumer Reports recommends the Tesla Model 3 sedan and rates its reliability as ""average."" But Fisher said the rest of Tesla's vehicles are below average. 
The popular Model Y SUV, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, has problems with poorly fitting body panels, leaks and issues with its climate control, Fisher said.
The larger Model X SUV ""still has problems with the falcon wing doors,"" Fisher said.
Consumer Reports has been critical of Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self Driving automated driving systems. Fisher said Consumer Reports still has concerns that drivers will rely too much on technology that cannot safely take over driving, but that did not factor into the reliability scores.
""Full Self Driving is not full self-driving at all,"" Fisher said. ""It's a convenience feature.""
Electric vehicle drive systems, or powertrains, are not the main source of problems, Fisher said. The issues reported by owners are with other features.
Manufacturers ""are using EVs as a technological test bed,"" Fisher said. ""Those are the things that go wrong.""
The top-ranked brand overall in the survey was Lexus, and eight of the ten top-scoring brands were Japanese. That continues a long-running trend.

Among brands owned by Detroit automakers, Buick was the only one in the top ten, in fifth place.
The Buick Envision, which is assembled in China, was the most reliable compact luxury SUV in the Consumer Reports survey.

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca on Thursday cemented its lead in bringing a preventative COVID-19 shot to market, saying its antibody cocktail offered 83% protection over six months, providing another possible weapon in the fight against the pandemic. 
The therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77% protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-antibody-works-prevent-treat-covid-19-longer-term-studies-2021-11-18 in August.
The data give hope of additional protection for people who do not respond well to vaccines, such as cancer patients.
The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88% when given within three days of the first symptoms.
The antibody treatment, enhanced to remain intact in the body for months, is given in one go, as two sequential shots in the arm.
The latest results from the longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), like rival  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) as a future supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy's ""real advantage"" was as a preventative shot.
The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
Pfizer https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-files-us-authorization-covid-19-pill-2021-11-16 has presented promising efficacy data on its oral COVID-19 treatment candidate, which can be more easily distributed than injections, and is also a leading vaccine supplier with partner BioNTech.
""These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442's potential ... We are progressing regulatory filings around the world and look forward to providing an important new option against SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible,"" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
The group last month sought approval for the medicine from U.S. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/astrazeneca-files-us-approval-drug-prevent-covid-19-2021-10-05 and European authorities https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-begins-real-time-review-astrazeneca-covid-19-antibody-cocktail-2021-10-14. Monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Lilly and GSK-Vir have been approved by U.S. regulators for treating unhospitalised COVID-19 patients.
Earlier this month, Regeneron https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/regenerons-antibody-therapy-shows-long-term-protection-against-covid-19-2021-11-08 said a single dose of its antibody cocktail reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 81.6% in a late-stage trial.
LONG-TERM
""This is an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for COVID"" if the published study confirms the data released on Thursday, said Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London. 
While the injection may be seen as a potential alternative to vaccines, antibody drugs cost significantly more, which may limit their use to particularly high-risk groups.
Antibody cocktails typically cost above $1,000 per dose, while COVID-19 shots have on average sold for between $3 and $30 per dose. 
Astra's Executive Vice President for vaccines and immune therapies, Iskra Reic, said on a call with media that unlike its vaccine, the drug would be priced commercially as it negotiates supply contracts with governments around the globe.
Chief executive Pascal Soriot said the treatment was more complicated to produce than a vaccine but that there would be enough production capacity around the world to meet demand. 
Monoclonal antibody drugs deliver lab-made versions of the body's natural antibodies to fight off infection, while vaccines spur the body to make its own antibodies and build its own immunity.
AstraZeneca has said the shot is primarily meant to help immunocompromised and at-risk individuals but at some point a wider group could benefit, such as military personnel on tours of duty or cruise ship passengers.
It would be administered in addition to vaccines, the company has said.
It added that about 2% of the global population was considered to inadequately respond to a COVID-19 vaccine. 
For AstraZeneca's PROVENT trial, close to 5,200 participants without an infection were randomly split into two groups, with one volunteer receiving an ineffective placebo without knowing for every two receiving Evusheld.
Participants were at risk of suffering severe COVID-19 if infected or were immunocompromised, meaning they were in cancer care, or receiving drugs due to an autoimmune disease or an organ transplant.

The trial volunteers were not vaccinated, even though high-risk groups have been prioritised in global vaccination campaigns. Anyone opting to get vaccinated during the trial was excluded from the analysis.
Trial volunteers will be followed up for 15 months to provide evidence of longer-lasting protection.

Because insurance companies usually fare well during inflation, we think it could be wise to add fundamentally sound insurance stocks Hartford Financial (HIG), Fairfax Financial (FRFHF), and Alleghany (NYSE:Y) to one’s portfolio. So, let’s discuss these names.The stock market has been volatile of late owing to rising inflation. The Consumer Price Index rose 6.2% in October from a year earlier, its biggest jump in more than 30 years. While the inflationary environment may not be favorable for all sectors, it could bode well for a few, such as insurance. Since high inflation usually leads to higher interest rates, it helps insurers earn more on their investments, thereby enhancing their profitability.
According to personal finance expert Suze Orman, “Only stocks have a track record of earning more than inflation.” During times like these, insurance companies, being of a defensive nature, can help combat inflation. Furthermore, according to an Insurance Journal report, the global insurance market is expected to exceed $7 trillion in premiums for the first time by mid-2022, which is earlier than expected.
So, to help protect one’s portfolio from inflation, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality insurance stocks—The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:HIG), Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (OTC:FRFHF), and Alleghany Corporation (Y).

(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp surged 12% on Thursday, taking the chipmaker closer to the $1 trillion valuation mark on hopes that it will get a boost from companies plowing billions of dollars into their ""metaverses"", the latest technology buzzword.
The company's stock has been on a tear, especially after Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), announced plans late in October to rebrand itself in a bid to build a metaverse around its widely used platforms.
Nvidia on Wednesday forecast upbeat fourth-quarter results, betting on growth in its business that supplies chips to power artificial intelligence and the metaverse.
It shares have more than doubled this year and breached the $800 billion valuation mark on Thursday, far outpacing those of rivals Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which have risen 0.82% and 65%, respectively.
Some analysts, however, remain cautious over the high valuation as Nvidia cements its position as the seventh most valuable U.S. company.
""Valuation will be the other potentially sticky factor, with the shares admittedly trading at eye-watering levels,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
RoundHill Ball (NYSE:BLL) Metaverse ETF, which tracks companies that benefit from metaverse, rose 1.7% to hit a record high.
With Nvidia its largest holding, the ETF has risen more than 20% since hitting a low on Oct. 4.
The company last month released Omniverse Enterprise, a set of software tools that will help companies create a ""metaverse"" of three-dimensional virtual worlds, the computing power for which would come from Nvidia's chips.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) rose 0.4% Thursday as the company said the U.S. government has placed a $5.29 billion order to buy 10 million treatment courses of its experimental drug for treating Covid-19.
The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the pill, and the supplies, to be completed by 2022, will start once that is in.
The company said it has also entered into advance purchase agreements with several other countries and has initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 nations around the world.
The treatment involves the antiviral pill, Paxlovid, to be given in combination with HIV drug ritonavir.
The antiviral pill is one of only three oral medicines so far to prove their efficacy against Covid-19, along with treatments from Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). Pfizer claims to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%. Merck's molnupiravir, developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, boasts an efficacy ratio of just over 50%.   
Pfizer recently raised its guidance, mostly banking on sales of its Comirnaty vaccine to boost sales. It now sees $81.5 billion in sales in 2021 at the midpoint of its forecast range, including $36 billion in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. That's $2.5 billion more than the previous forecast.
The pill is seen as the second winner in the company’s Covid portfolio that is now looking at approvals to its booster dose to lend more strength to the sales.
The company is awaiting the outcome of today’s meeting of FDA experts who will discuss the merits of a third shot for all adults. So far, only those at least 65 or vulnerable are eligible for a third shot of the company’s vaccine.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent committee will meet Friday to discuss the same.
Gains from the pill could be limited though as the company will allow generic manufacturers to make the medicine while waiving royalties on sales in low- and middle-income countries."

Among the top pipeline assets, Mathai Mammen, global head of research for J&J's Janssen pharmaceutical division, pointed to a drug combination for non-small cell lung cancer, an anticoagulant it is developing with partner Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb and a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
J&J said last week that it plans to spin off its consumer health division that sells Listerine and Band-Aid bandages in order to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices in the biggest shakeup in the U.S. company's 135-year history. 
Mammen in an interview said he did not think the transaction would change much in terms of research and development spending.
""We're really happy and proud of the way R&D is functioning - the strategy we're using and the level of investments,"" he said.
J&J developed one of the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States, but its use in the country tailed off sharply after rare cases of blood clotting were linked to the shot.
Nonetheless, Mammen said J&J still expects to develop more vaccines using the same adenovirus vector technology.
""It induces not just antibodies that tend to be relatively short-lived, but also good, multiple kinds of T-cells... so you have that really long-lasting benefit,"" Mammen said.

(Reuters) -Coty Inc on Thursday forecast revenue growth for the next several years, after a long streak of declines, as it benefits from improving U.S. and China beauty markets and a sales rebound in airport duty-free stores.
The company has been focusing more on high-end fragrances, skincare products and other categories that picked up pace last year, while demand for makeup products waned following the pandemic outbreak that forced people to venture out less.
The Hugo Boss fragrance maker has also been trying to revive its CoverGirl, Rimmel and Max Factor brands through new launches, collaborations with celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra and America Ferrera, and spending more on advertising.
""The beauty market has been consistently growing at 3% to 5% rate and we expect to overperform this,"" Coty (NYSE:COTY) Chief Executive Officer Sue Nabi said.
Coty forecast net revenue growth of 6% to 8% for each of the next three financial years through 2025, with plans to grow it further in the following years.
""The company made a bold proclamation by laying out a target (at) a level that rivals peer & partner algorithms,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephanie Wissink said.
Earlier this month, Coty forecast fiscal 2022 like-for-like sales to increase in the low-to-mid teens percentage.
Coty also said doubling down on its online business and higher-end brands would help it approach core earnings of $1 billion in calendar year 2022. Analysts expect $987.5 million, per Refinitiv IBES.
It forecast adjusted core earnings to increase 9% to 11% annually through fiscal 2025 and beyond.

It said it would divest its remaining 26% stake in professional beauty business Wella by fiscal 2025 to further simplify its capital structure, having offloaded the rest since December last year.

59,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",What Are Day Traders Thinking? S&P's Twitter Sentiment Index Has Answer,"(Bloomberg) -- A year after meme mania broke out, Wall Street’s still obsessing over what day-traders are up to. 
S&P Dow Jones Indices said Thursday it is launching gauges that will measure daily sentiment on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in a bid to get a grip on what “everyone” is thinking. Two new indices will be based on analyses of tweets that contain so-called “$cashtags,” which Twitter users deploy to reference stock symbols on the social-media platform.
“Factor-based indices are a popular strategy for passive investors, so we’re excited to work with Twitter to bring this unique tilt to the S&P 500,” Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.
The index provider is debuting the S&P 500 Twitter Sentiment Index, which will measure the performance of 200 constituents with the highest sentiment scores. That gauge will be float-adjusted. The second, the S&P 500 Twitter Sentiment Select Equal Weight Index, will measure performance of 50 stocks on a more equal basis. The indexes are going to rebalance at the beginning of each month. 
Wall Street professionals have all year been trying to deduce what day-traders are thinking about and what moves they might make next after an en-masse effort at the start of 2021 showed they could affect the movement of stock prices. Many traders scroll through Reddit blogs to suss out the next big thing, while others obsessively track Stocktwits citations. There are even firms hiring WallStreetBets veterans to get inside the heads of the people who call themselves apes with diamond hands.
UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) recently also, amid elevated at-home trader participation, came out with a model that flags retail signals for stock returns. 
Stock discussions taking place on Twitter are having an increasingly significant impact on markets, S&P Dow Jones said. Conversations around finance were up more than 26% last year versus the year before, according to the social-media platform’s internal data cited by the company.

So, is it wise to add the stock to one’s portfolio now based on its strategic collaborations? Let’s find out.The shares of New York City-based Omnichannel dog-centric company, the Original BARK Company (BARK) climbed in price after the company made its stock market debut on June 2, 2021. It had merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Northern Star Acquisition Corp., to facilitate its IPO. And in July 2021, the Dunkin’ Joy in Childhood Foundation and BARK, the maker of BarkBox, announced a second collaboration featuring two “pawsome” new dog toys.
For its fiscal second quarter, ended September 30, 2021, BARK’s revenue came in at $120.16 million, up 39.1% year-over-year. However, the company’s adjusted net loss increased 711.2% year-over-year to $11.03 million. In comparison, its adjusted EBITDA was negative $8.78 million compared to a $1.07 million gain in the year-ago period. Its shares have declined 16.8% in price since the earnings release on November 10.
Furthermore, the stock has lost more than 14% over the past three months to close yesterday’s trading session at $6.20. According to a report from The Zebra, 38.4% of American households own a dog. Dog ownership has increased amid the pandemic, with people spending more time at home. However, with the gradual economic recovery and several offices reopening, dog ownership growth might slow in the coming months. Moreover, high shipping costs are expected to harm BARK’s business in the near term, so its prospects look bleak.

The world's second largest economy has been recovering from the pandemic, but power shortages and supply chain woes have hurt factory output, with sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks hampering consumption growth.

Chief Financial Officer Roger Dassen said ASML, which is currently operating at full capacity amid the global semiconductor shortage, thinks it will have a similar level of sales in China in 2022. 
""I expect that sales into domestic China will be a little in excess of 2 billion (euros) this year,"" he said, distributed between logic and memory chip customers.
""For next year I wouldn't expect a dramatic increase in that number, but we would expect that number to be sustained, so also next year pretty strong sales.""
ASML is the dominant maker of lithography systems, technology used to create the circuitry of computer chips.
Due to U.S. government military concerns, the allied Dutch government has not granted ASML permission to ship its most advanced tools to China. However, Chinese companies are major buyers of ASML's earlier generation products and China is the company's third-largest market, behind Taiwan and South Korea.
In a reference to discussions in U.S. policy circles about whether lithography sales to China should be further restricted, Dassen said that would not impact ASML immediately.
""If for whatever reason, something were to happen on the China front, for instance more stringent regulation ... in all likelihood that demand would be hoovered up someplace else,"" he said.

Investing.com — Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:DRNA) shares have opened 78% above Wednesday's close after the company said it has agreed to be acquired by Danish drug maker Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) for $3.3 billion.
""Since the start of our collaboration two years ago, the Dicerna and Novo Nordisk teams have established a strong rapport built on a foundation of mutual respect for one another's capabilities, culture and expertise,"" said Douglas Fambrough, Founder, President, and CEO of Dicerna.
Dicerna shares are trading at $37.94 in the morning session.
Novo Nordisk will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dicerna common stock for $38.25 per share in cash.
Novo's strategic move will expand its use of Dicerna's ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) platform. Dicerna develops RNAi-based therapies to selectively silence genes that can cause or contribute to disease.
Novo also knows Dicerna well, having entered a research collaboration with the company to discover and develop RNAi therapies using its GalXC RNAi platform technology.
Dicerna told investors that Novo Nordisk expects to initiate clinical development of the first investigational RNAi therapeutic from this collaboration in 2022.
“The combination of Dicerna’s expertise in RNAi and oligonucleotide therapeutics and highly skilled employees with Novo Nordisk’s industry leadership in developing and commercializing medicines to treat serious chronic diseases, has the potential to significantly accelerate and expand our mission to deliver GalXC RNAi therapies for the benefit of patients and all our stakeholders,” added Farmbrough.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union may ease state-aid rules to allow the funding of new chip plants to tackle shortages in the bloc, its competition chief said on Thursday, while resisting pressure led by France for a no-holds-barred approach to subsidies.
Due to its reliance on Asian chips, the EU has been particularly hard hit by an unprecedented global shortage in semiconductors that is holding up the delivery of goods from cars to Playstations and driving up smartphone prices worldwide. 
The European Commission may approve state aid to fill funding gaps, in particular if it helps set up cutting edge chip plants, Margrethe Vestager told a news conference.
The Commission, which oversees antitrust policy in the 27 EU countries, would seek to ensure such support was subject to strong competition safeguards though and that the benefits were shared widely https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-europe-must-work-together-stay-forefront-high-tech-merkel-2021-11-17 and without discrimination across the European economy, she added.
""Each case for the supply of semiconductors will be rigorously assessed based on their respective merits, so as to ensure that a project has a European nature and of course avoid a subsidy race within the union and beyond,"" Vestager noted.
The U.S. last year announced its CHIPS for America Act aimed at boosting its ability to compete with Chinese technology while the EU - seeking to double the bloc's share of global chip output to 20% over the next decade - plans to adopt its own chips act in 2022.
The U.S. chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) has said it could invest as much as 80 billion euros ($91 billion) in Europe over the next decade, with Germany and France seen as the leading contenders for production sites.
France had been pushing for the EU to allow subsidies with fewer restrictions, but smaller nations such as the Netherlands and Ireland argued that allowing excessive and non-targeted use of strategic funds would cause unfair competition within the bloc.
The creation of just one mega-semiconductor factory in Europe could add between 77-85 billion euros additional GDP over a 10-year period, over twice the investment needed to set it up, according to research by management consulting company Kearney.
Separately, the Commission strengthened its control of acquisitions in the digital sector, reacting to increasing concern about the dominance of U.S. tech giants and Chinese state entities acquiring EU technologies.
It will encourage member states to refer transactions for review, even if national thresholds for referral are not reached, the Commission said.
It will also allow the Commission to review whether there is competitive potential in an acquisition beyond what turnover would suggest, in particular in the digital sector.
France and Germany have argued that antitrust policy should not hinder the creation of European champions that can compete more effectively against huge global players, particularly from China, recalling regulators blocking mergers such as Siemens' planned acquisition of France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in 2019. 

As COVID infection numbers reached new records in some EU member states, the Commission extended looser state aid rules for virus-hit companies for six months to June 2022 to slowly wean them off more than 3 trillion euros ($3.4 trillion) provided across the EU.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, again buffeted by some uneven earnings reports, against a backdrop of a steady improvement in the labor market. 
Earlier, fresh data showed initial jobless claims stayed basically unchanged at 268,000 last week, while continuing claims fell more clearly to a new post-pandemic low of 2.08 million. The Philadelphia Reserve's monthly manufacturing index, by contrast, sent a much clearer signal of current activity, rising well above expectations as companies raced to meet orders.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 43 points, or 0.1% at 35,888 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% however, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%, which chipmakers gaining after a very upbeat forecast from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday. 
Nvidia stock itself was the most actively traded stock on the market, rising over 10% after its numbers, which beat expectations thanks to ongoing strong demand for its data center and gaming chips. Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) stock also gained from the announcement, rising 4.6%. Nvidia for the first time had talked openly about the potential it sees for demand from the so-called 'metaverse', which it expects to drive demand for high-powered chips well into the future. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock - another tipped heavily to be a winner from that trend, gained another 6.6% at the open and is now up 38% in the last week alone, and up 71% over the last month.
In a very different sector, Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock also soared after numbers for the latest months showed it had paradoxically emerged stronger from the pandemic, having been forced to accelerate a transition to an omnichannel model. The department store chain said Thursday it will launch its own curated marketplace in an attempt to cement those gains, while also lifting its earnings guidance for 2021 again.
However, as has been the case all week, disappointing retail results met a savage response.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs fell 9.7% after its sales and earnings fell short of estimates, and the stock is now back testing the 34-month low that it hit earlier in the summer at the peak of the Chinese government's regulatory crackdown on Internet companies. Smaller e-commerce rival Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) also fell 15% after its quarterly earnings, but JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) rose 4.1% after its numbers beat expectations,
Elsewhere, electric vehicles continued to retrace after their recent rally left them overextended. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock fell 8.9% and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock fell 9.7%. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) underperformed again, falling 1.2% as traders bet on a battle with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over its fee structure next year. Amazon had sent a shot across larger rival Visa (NYSE:V)'s bows on Wednesday, dropping Visa's credit cards from its U.K. site."
76,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 09:32AM ET</span>",Europe's gas firms prime pipelines for hydrogen highway,"By Vera Eckert, Stephen Jewkes and Isla Binnie
(Reuters) - As world leaders hammered out a deal last week to slow climate change, gas engineer Michele Ricciardi was digging into a practical problem: How thousands of miles of pipelines across Italy and Europe can safely carry hydrogen.
The Italian is at the forefront of gas carriers' efforts to prepare for a lower carbon future: If fossil fuels are phased out in coming decades, natural gas companies believe that should not mean the infrastructure that carries them must go too. They want to repurpose pipelines to carry zero-emissions hydrogen after countries wean themselves off natural gas.
The effort by nearly two dozen companies reflects the accelerating pace of planning taking place in the global oil and gas industry, from drillers to refiners, keen to adapt as governments and activists ramp up the pressure to slash greenhouse gases. Besides practical preparation, the transition puts firms into competition with other energy sources for funding, even as they invest billions of euros in markets they can't predict. 
The hydrogen project - involving Italy's  Snam SpA  (OTC:SNMRY), Spain's Enagas S.A. and Germany's Open Grid Europe (OGE) among others – would rely on vast solar farms as far flung as the Sahara desert to create the energy needed to produce hydrogen from water.
That fuel would then be piped to Europe's industrial heartland along the existing web of natural gas pipelines – a 198,500 km (123,300 mile) network that, if untangled, could encircle the equator four times.
""Once we have the sun of the Sahara in German factories ... that's like the Roman roads we are still walking on today,"" Ricciardi's boss Marco Alvera, chief executive of Snam, told Reuters. ""It's forever.""
The companies want to form a European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) to prevent the pipelines from rusting up into what the industry calls ""stranded assets."" They calculate that some 69% of existing pipelines can be converted for up to 81 billion euros ($94 billion).
The project is one of hundreds of plans to build a hydrogen economy, which the European Union says could involve investments of up to 460 billion euros by 2030.
A hydrogen supply network could add to Europe's energy security: The bloc currently relies on natural gas to meet 28% of its energy needs, with a third of the gas from Russia. Politicians have recently accused Moscow of holding back supplies as gas prices climbed to record levels. Russia says it has filled all its contractual requirements.
""I think it's a brilliant idea,"" Frans Timmermans, European Commissioner for Climate Action, told Reuters. Adapting existing natural gas networks to transport hydrogen is about 25% of the cost of building a new infrastructure for renewable energy, he said.
But the European Union is not providing cash for the venture - that must come from industry or national governments. So it will need political and industrial support.
To succeed, the gas grids need to be able to direct hydrogen blended with natural gas to the customers who can use it – like steelmakers, chemical companies and refineries. The supply needs to be safe, and volumes big enough for it to be affordable. 
Eventually - if green hydrogen can be provided in huge quantities - the auto industry and home heating suppliers may also start to use it. But that wouldn't be before 2030, studies show.
The gas grid companies say their main challenge now is the fact Europe has no regulatory framework for them to adapt the network. ""The regulation needs to define hydrogen as a gas that can be transported and used similarly to natural gas,"" said Maria Sicilia, strategy director at Enagas. If the regulation sets standards, she said, the networks can be interlinked.
VOLATILITY
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, mostly occurring bound to oxygen in water. But it's also one of the most highly combustible. In the past, dozens of hydrogen airships that exploded or burned, including the Hindenburg fire of 1937, have convinced many that hydrogen is highly risky.
Snam and other companies say their industry has decades of experience, having built the infrastructure in the first place, so hydrogen need be no more hazardous than other fuels used today. If hydrogen leaks into the open air, it rises and its concentration falls rapidly below the explosive level, according to Zukunft Gas, a German gas lobby. 
From his office near Snam's critical gas-flow room at Milan headquarters, Ricciardi and his team have for the past three years combed bit by bit through Europe's biggest gas transport network to make sure it can handle the gas. Snam has said it is ready to spend more than 3 billion euros on the replacement of gas pipelines that are hydrogen-compliant.
""We've been moving natural gas around for the last 80 years,"" says Ricciardi, whose job is to establish standards that the industry can agree to make pipes safe. ""Now we've got to do it with hydrogen."" 
Flammability is just one problem. Compared to natural gas, hydrogen also leaks more easily because its molecules are smaller. Its flow patterns are different, and it even attacks some grades of steel, making them brittle. 
The changes needed will vary by gas grid, but companies must examine pipes meticulously to make sure the steel is sound and the seals airtight. Compressor stations along the way may need to be adapted, and installations will be fitted with sensors to track leaks and then vent and divert them. 
The oil and other industries already use hydrogen as a feedstock - Germany's supply amounts to the equivalent of about a tenth of its power usage, mostly in steel and chemicals. But that gas is made using fossil fuels and is known as ""grey"" hydrogen [nL4N2S72U5].
The pipeline network already includes four lines connecting Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia with Spain and Italy. 
""The problem now of course is that it is filled with natural gas,"" said Ad van Wijk, a professor of future energy systems at Delft Technical University. But ""the backbone is already in place,"" he said. He advocates linking up Europe and Africa to run Europe's energy system on 50% renewable energy and 50% green hydrogen.
Cost is another concern. So far, ""green"" hydrogen has been produced mostly for experimental projects. It costs four to five times more than the grey variety to produce.
To cut that, the industry and consumers need to scale up production and demand.
Snam's Alvera says solar panels in southern Spain, the Sahara and parts of the Middle East can provide cheap renewable electricity to power electrolysis plants which pump hydrogen into the repurposed pipes. Spain is already one of the cheapest sites in Europe to produce renewable electricity, according to industry association Solar Power Europe, and costs are projected to fall.
Meanwhile, the companies say they can also carry gas produced from fossil fuels but with the resulting emissions captured - known as ""blue"" hydrogen.
Thomas Deser, a senior portfolio manager at huge German fund Union Investment, is sceptical. He believes that ""before the middle of the decade, without subsidies, you cannot make any money from producing green hydrogen."" 
RIVAL CLAIMS
The hydrogen backbone is now in competition for state money. Germany is Europe's biggest energy consumer. Berlin has pledged 9 billion euros up to 2030 to develop a green hydrogen industry, two billion of it earmarked to boost imports from partner countries such as Morocco, Chile, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
But electricity is another fast-growing source of relatively clean power, and Germany's electricity transmission network is also in growing demand. Germany plans to spend 1 billion euros by 2025 on electric vehicle charging infrastructure, plus hundreds of millions more on purchasing premiums and tax breaks. 
The country is home to the world's biggest carmaker by volume, Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY). While car firms are developing hydrogen fuel-cell prototypes alongside battery cars, Europe's automakers don't see hydrogen as their first choice of power.
VW has already committed billions of euros to battery-based electric vehicle technology. It told Reuters it believes changes in powering mobility must take place in large volumes. Herbert Diess, VW's CEO, tweeted in May that ""the hydrogen car is proven to NOT be the climate-friendly solution,"" saying ""electrification has established itself in traffic."" 
Nonetheless, new demand for hydrogen is emerging: Globally, 359 large-scale projects had been announced by July 2021, according to the Hydrogen Council and consultants McKinsey, which said 80% of new initiatives were in Europe.
Snam says it has successfully tested a mix of natural gas and 30% hydrogen to fire furnaces at an Italian steel company.
In Milan, Ricciardi says ramping up blending rates is tricky, so standards are crucial. 

""We're working on the new rule book to make sure the network is up to the job,"" Ricciardi said. ""There's a lot riding on it.""

And solid third-quarter corporate earnings and the Fed’s loose monetary policy are expected to support the market’s momentum despite investors’ concerns about high inflation. Given the favorable trends, Wall Street analysts see more than a 25% potential upside in low-priced stocks Castlight Health (NYSE:CSLT) and Lincoln (LINC). Thus, we think now could be the right time to scoop up these stocks. Let’s discuss.The S&P 500 registered 65 all-time highs this year and has more than doubled since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The benchmark saw eight straight all-time closing highs last week. Although the major benchmarks dipped in their last trading session due to concerns over the market’s vulnerability to rising inflation and a surge in COVID-19 cases, the indices are still hovering near their record highs. The Dow is just 1.7% shy of its all-time high, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 0.6% and 0.8% from their record highs, respectively.
Also on the positive side macroeconomically, weekly jobless claims are expected to reach a new pandemic-era low. Analysts expect unemployment claims to come in at 260,000 versus 267,000 reported in the prior week, which would mark the sixth straight week with jobless claims below the 300,000 level. Also, President Biden recently signed the long-awaited trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure bill into law, which could potentially boost the U.S economy further.
The economic recovery, low-interest-rate environment, and solid corporate earnings should continue supporting the stock market. Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts expect low-priced stocks Castlight Health, Inc. (CSLT) and Lincoln Educational Services Corporation (LINC) to rally by more than 25% in the near term. This, along with solid fundamentals, we think makes these stocks good bets right now.

Investing.com – Affirm stock (NASDAQ:AFRM) fell nearly 4% Thursday as the company said it will sell $1.25 billion in convertible notes to support its growth plans.
Affirm, a buy now, pay later financial company, said the money from the issue could go into working capital, capital spending and associated investments.
The parties to the offering will have the option to buy more paper worth $187.5 million within 13 days of the first issue.
The notes will mature on November 15, 2026, the company said.
Affirm may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes after November 20, 2024, but only if the share price exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time.
As the name suggests, a convertible note, while being debt to start with, can be converted into stock. Investors don’t always take kindly to issue of convertible notes, because the issue of new stock ultimately depresses earnings per share.

With the deal, Novo is following rivals including Novartis by betting on RNA interference technology, or RNAi, where genes that contribute to disease are silenced or rendered ineffective. Genes play a primary role in thousands of diseases.
Novo started a research collaboration with Dicerna in 2019, pursuing several clinical candidates for disorders including chronic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), type 2 diabetes, obesity and rare diseases. 
""This acquisition supports Novo Nordisk's strategy of developing and applying a broad range of technology platforms across all Novo Nordisk therapeutic areas,"" the company said in a statement.
The deal for $38.25 per share represents a premium of 79.7% to the closing price on Wednesday for Dicerna, which is based in Lexington, Massachusetts. 
Novo, the world's biggest producer of diabetes drugs, said it expects to initiate clinical development of the first investigational therapeutic to emerge from this collaboration in 2022.
Novartis bought anti-cholesterol RNAi drug Leqvio, or inclisiran, in 2019 as part of its $9.7 billion takeover of The Medicines Co. The compound is approved for use in Europe but the U.S. clearance has been delayed.
Other companies that work on RNAi cardiovascular drugs include Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) with partner Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARWR) as well as Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and partner Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.
Novo's U.S.-listed shares traded 1.2% higher in premarket. Its Copenhagen-listed shares were up 0.5%, largely unchanged.

The transaction, which will mainly be debt-financed, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The acquisition will not impact Novo's full-year guidance, but is estimated to have a negative impact on operating profit growth in 2022 of around 3%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX)'s newest cafe lacks one element most customers are used to seeing: cashiers. 
The global coffee chain on Thursday opened its first ever location in partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Go, the e-commerce giant's brick-and-mortar convenience store, where customers can sit at a table with a latte or grab a sandwich from a shelf and walk out. 
Hit by a U.S. labor crunch, Starbucks and other companies are expanding labor-saving technology like artificial intelligence, robotics and digital touch screens.
White Castle is testing a robotic fry cook and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc is experimenting with self-driving vehicles for delivery.  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) is developing automated order taking for McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) drive-thrus.
U.S. restaurant staffing levels broadly are still at least 10% lower than before the pandemic, helping boost margins, said Rabobank analyst Tom Bailey.
""You'd see some of the digital automation tools deployed to cover that 10% gap as they grow,"" he said.
The pandemic pushed people to place more orders online for carry out, delivery and drive-thru. To keep up, Starbucks shifted its development strategy to new store formats, adding pickup-only locations in urban areas, as well as traditional cafes and suburban drive-thrus. 
Starbucks and Amazon plan to open at least two more U.S. locations together in 2022, said Kathryn Young, Starbucks' senior vice president of global growth and development.
Starbucks baristas will make drinks and the rest of the chain's menu at the new location in New York City, which will have the same staffing level as any other Starbucks, she said. 

Customers can order through the Starbucks app and grab coffee to go from a counter near the door. Or they can use a credit card, Amazon app or Amazon One palm reader to enter the rest of the space, take snacks from shelves, or sit at tables. 
(This story officially corrects number of joint locations to open in 2022 to two from three in eighth paragraph)

82,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",Court says VW should have published engine plan that sparked dieselgate,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Volkswagen should have gone public in 2008 with the engine plan that sparked its diesel emissions scandal, a German court said on Thursday, as it set out its views on a test case brought by investors against the automaker. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. diesel engine tests, said it had fulfilled all its disclosure obligations and any compensation claims were unfounded.
The 2015 admission sparked the biggest crisis in Volkswagen's history and has cost the German company more than 32 billion euros ($38 billion) in vehicle refits, fines and legal costs so far.
The scandal has been traced back to 2008, approximately when Volkswagen started using software to control diesel engine emissions that was later ruled illegal when discovered by U.S. regulators. 
Whether investors can claim compensation for the plunge in Volkswagen's share price after the scandal was exposed depends on whether it can be proven that any member of the company's executive board was aware the plan constituted cheating, the higher regional court in Braunschweig said on Thursday.
Volkswagen says it held nothing back.
""The management board of Volkswagen had no reliable knowledge that the software used in U.S. diesel vehicles contained a defeat device prohibited by U.S. law until the summer of 2015,"" it said in a statement.
""This case is only concerned with whether Volkswagen fulfilled its disclosure obligations towards shareholders and the capital market. We are convinced that this is the case. All alleged claims for damages are therefore unfounded,"" it said.
The test case was brought against Volkswagen and its controlling shareholder, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, by fund manager Deka Investment GmbH.
A law firm representing Deka Investment could not immediately be reached to comment.
The Braunschweig court said for the time before July 9, 2012, due to a statute of limitations, it was up to the plaintiffs to prove that a Volkswagen board member knew the plan was cheating.

For the time since that date, Volkswagen has to prove that management's failure to make a statement in 2008 was neither deliberate nor grossly negligent.
The parties have time until the end of January to comment on the court's preliminary conclusion and to provide evidence on what knowledge management had, the court said.

GM unveiled BrightDrop in January in a bid to grab a chunk of the growing electric delivery vehicle business to better compete with rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and other companies such as Rivian Automotive Inc.
GM has outlined plans to double its revenue by 2030 and become the leader in U.S. electric vehicle sales.
Merchants Fleet's order would bring its total BrightDrop electric vehicles to 18,000. Of the total, 12,600 orders, announced in February, are for BrightDrop's full-size delivery van EV600 and the remaining 5,400 are for its medium-sized van EV410.
The EV410, which was unveiled in September and offers a driving range of 250 miles (400 km) between charges, has already bagged  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) as a customer.

U.S. president Joe Biden and fellow Democrats in Congress have proposed nearly $50 billion in tax breaks, incentives for government agencies to buy electric vehicles, and loans for retooling factories, which could provide further impetus to automakers' electric vehicle plans.

The drug, sotrovimab, branded as Xevudy was already under a speedy review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and GSK's application makes the drug the fourth application currently under EU lenses for the treatment of COVID-19.
The drug is authorised for emergency use in the United States to prevent mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 from worsening. The EMA has given its go-ahead for use by member states but Thursday's application would count for an EU-wide approval, if recommended by the EMA.
Unlike oral options from Merck and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), sotrovimab is given via an infusion. Sotrovimab belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies that are lab-generated compounds mimicking the body's natural defences. 

However, last week GSK and Vir said a study showed the antibody treatment would work when given as a shot in the arm as well, potentially offering more convenience.
The EMA recently backed similar antibody therapies from American-Swiss partners Regeneron-Roche and another from South Korea's Celltrion, as the region builds up its defence against surging cases.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) is ready to make more acquisitions to expand its fast-growing solutions and products business, the world's largest cement maker said on Thursday, as it announced its 2025 goals.
Holcim wants to expand the share of the division - which makes pre-cast concretes, roofing products, asphalt and dry mortars - to 30% of its sales, helping to broaden its business.
In 2020, the division represented 8.2% of its sales, although since then Holcim has bought Firestone Building Products, a roofing products business, for $3.4 billion, its biggest deal in more than a decade.
""Roofing sales are already delivering double-digit growth in the $50 billion global flat roofing market and will double to $4 billion by 2025 with strategic investments and acquisitions,"" Holcim said.
The drive will help improve Holcim's environmental profile as many products like roofing reduce energy loss from buildings.
The expansion was one of several new targets Holcim unveiled ahead of its investor day on Thursday after the Swiss company achieved its 2022 targets a year early.
""With our new level of performance, we have the firepower to invest in Solutions & Products,"" Chief Executive Jan Jenisch said in a statement.
Holcim, which generates most of its sales from cement, concrete and aggregates, is aiming for group annual sales to increase by 3% to 5% after currency movements and portfolio changes. 
The goal is the same as the company had targeted in its 2022 strategy. Holcim is also aiming to increase its recurring operating profit at a faster rate than sales.
Holcim, formerly known as LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY), plans to spend 500 million Swiss francs ($539 million) on 'green capex,' the company said, with increased spending on projects like carbon capture at its plants and recycling more of it materials.
Holcim has previously been bullish about its prospects, saying it expected a period of abnormally strong demand as economies bounce back from the pandemic and government infrastructure packages support building projects.
But concerns about its carbon footprint have deterred many investors, with its share price rising only 3.5% in the last 12 months, compared with a 26.3% gain by the broader European construction materials sector.

Its stock was indicated 0.9% higher in pre-market trade.

(Reuters) - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc on Thursday said it was partnering with San Francisco-based startup Bolt to add one-click checkouts for retailers that use Adobe's e-commerce software tools.
Once known for software such as Photoshop, Adobe has branched out into digital marketing and e-commerce tools for retailers. 
Offering a one-click checkout feature to the merchants that use Adobe's tools will help them compete against Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has long had such a feature. It will also help Adobe compete for merchants against rival Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc, which has its own one-click checkout technology called Shop Pay.
Under the deal, Adobe's customers can integrate Bolt's one-click feature into their checkout screens. Bolt has a network of about 10 million shoppers, and if it has seen a shopper before, it can fill in their payment details, an otherwise burdensome step when many shoppers abandon their cart.
""We see a 60% higher conversion rate when we're able to pre-populate all of that information,"" Bob Buch, chief business officer of Bolt, told Reuters.
Bolt will charge a fee to merchants when its network helps them make a sale, but Bolt and Adobe said they are still working on the financial details of the partnership.
Adobe also recently announced it will offer payment-processing services for merchants, but Justin Merickel, vice president for business development at Adobe, said merchants don't need to use Adobe's in-house payment processing to use the Bolt tools.

Jordan Jewell, research director for digital commerce at IDC, said the deal is the latest in a string of Adobe partnerships, such as a deal with FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) to ease shipping complexity, aimed at helping merchants compete with Amazon, which held a patent on one-click checkouts until 2017.
""For Adobe, it’s about emulating what Amazon is doing and what Shopify is doing as well,"" Jewell said.

The brokerage gave an ""outperform"" rating to the stock on Thursday, saying the U.S. planemaker can ramp up global deliveries of the MAX jet to 52 per month in 2024, a rate which could eliminate Boeing's inventory of excess 737s by 2025. 
It had downgraded the stock by a notch in March 2020, just when the pandemic had started to extract a huge toll on the airline industry. Boeing's 737 MAX had already been grounded for a year by then, following two deadly air crashes.
Earlier this week, China's aviation regulator agreed that design changes Boeing proposed for its 737 MAX plane could resolve safety problems.
""MAX certification is just one element of Boeing's China exposure, with another being future orders,"" said J.P.Morgan's Seth Seifman, a four-star rated analyst by Refinitiv for his estimate accuracy.
Seifman estimates 445 deliveries of 737 MAX aircrafts in 2022, or 37 planes per month, compared with an average delivery of about 20 planes each in the last four months.

The analyst also raised his price target on Boeing to $275 from $260, indicating a 21.3% upside to the stock's Wednesday close. 
""Boeing's position at the center of global air travel offers confidence that it will recover financially over time and we believe risk-reward now skews favorably,"" Seifman said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Digital payments start-up Paytm made one of the worst major Indian stock market debuts on Thursday as its shares fell more than 27% after India's largest-ever IPO.
Paytm's debut rout raised questions around impending initial public offerings (IPOs) on the until-now red hot Indian market, including those of its smaller rival MobiKwik and hotel aggregator OYO, as valuations come under investor scrutiny.
While some investors had questioned Paytm's lack of profits and its lofty enterprise value of around 27 times gross profit, the extent of its price fall shocked many and wiped more than $5 billion off Paytm's IPO valuation.
As the price plummeted, it only stalled when Paytm shares came close to circuit breaking levels on Indian exchanges.
Paytm, backed by China's Ant Group and Japan's SoftBank, grew rapidly after Uber (NYSE:UBER) listed it as a quick payment option in India and its popularity surged amid the government's demonetization exercise in 2016.
Its founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who cried with joy at the opening ceremony, later told Reuters he was unperturbed by the slide and did not regret listing in India.
""One day does not decide what our future is,"" he said. 
""It is new business model. It takes a lot for someone to understand it,"" Sharma added in response to the market fall.
Paytm has expanded into services including insurance, gold sales, film and flight ticketing, bank deposits and remittances.
The value of Sharma's equity holdings and ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) were $600 million lower at $1.69 billion at Paytm's closing price of 1,560.8 rupees, according to Reuters calculations using figures in Paytm's IPO prospectus.
Sharma did cash-in on the IPO however, selling some 1.87 million shares at the issue price of 2,150 rupees per share, netting 4.02 billion rupees ($54 million).
BREAKEVEN
Paytm expects it could break even by late next year or in early 2023, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in July, although the company said in its prospectus it expected to make losses for the foreseeable future. 
Investors and analysts on Thursday expressed concerns over valuing the loss-making firm at some $18.7 billion in the IPO.
""Paytm's financials are not very impressive and the growth prospects seem limited... obviously the company lacks a clear path to profits,"" Shifara Samsudeen, a LightStream Research analyst who publishes on SmartKarma, said.
The company reported a loss of 3.82 billion rupees ($51.5 million) in the quarter ended in June, wider than a loss of 2.84 billion rupees for the same period last year.
Sharma said Paytm could turn profitable when it did not need to invest ""so much more"" to fuel growth opportunities.
Although Paytm's $2.5 billion IPO was priced at the top of the indicative range, demand was weaker than other recent start-up IPOs like Nykaa and Zomato, which were oversubscribed several times over.
INFLATED VALUATIONS
Many market participants saw Paytm's slide as a sign that local investors had become disillusioned with heady valuations.
""Most of the domestic institutional investors appear to have skipped the IPO,"" added Aequitas Research director Sumeet Singh, who publishes on Smartkarma.
He said that the stock was offered at 27 times enterprise value/gross profit for fiscal 2024, more than the 21.3 times for Zomato Ltd. 
Singh also noted both Ant and SoftBank had cut their stakes in the IPO. Ant reduced its to 23% from 28% and SoftBank's Vision Fund pared its holding by 2.5 percentage points to 16%.
The listing could bring ""an end to obnoxious pricing in IPO markets"", Mumbai-based investment adviser Sandip Sabharwal said.
Food delivery firm Zomato surged 66% at its July debut after raising $1.2 billion.

More recently, shares in FSN E-Commerce Ventures, which owns cosmetics-to-fashion platform Nykaa, jumped 80% after its Nov. 10 $700-million IPO debut.

Investing.com – Kohl's stock (NYSE:KSS) stock rose 7% on Thursday after raising its full-year guidance for the third time as more consumers opt for casual lifestyle apparel sold by the company.
The company’s decision to boost its share repurchases to $1.3 billion in the year, up from the $700 million it planned earlier was also lending strength to the stock. The company has so far spent $761 million on the buyback.
Third-quarter record sales and earnings led the company to raise its annual forecast one more time.
Kohl's now expects annual net sales to rise by around 25% compared to the about 22% growth forecast it gave out in August.
Total revenue in the third quarter was around 15% higher at $4.6 billion as the company reaped the benefit of shift in consumer preference for a casual and relaxed lifestyle.
Kohl's said it is pleased with the response to its rollout of Sephora products at its stores -- an attempt to position the company as a beauty destination in order to attract a younger audience.
The company’s adjusted profit was $243 million compared to a negligible $2 million in the third quarter of 2020. On a per share basis, it was more than double the estimate.

ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) mapped out plans to break off further parts of its sprawling empire on Thursday, continuing a major overhaul that has put the conglomerate on a more stable financial footing after years of losses and leadership crises.
""We've left no stone unturned in our business to improve our performance,"" Chief Executive Martina Merz said. ""After a good two years of intensive transformation work, we can now say that the turnaround is evident.""
The submarines-to-steel group, which was forced to part ways with its elevator division last year to avert collapse, said it was now preferring to list its hydrogen unit Uhde Chlorine Engineers (UCE) in an initial public offering.
UCE, a 66-34 joint venture of Thyssenkrupp and Italy's De Nora, is the world's largest supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies used to produce hydrogen. Analysts have valued UCE anywhere between 3 billion to 6 billion euros.
Merz said Thyssenkrupp would keep a majority stake in UCE in an IPO, which is planned for the spring, adding a capital markets day for the unit was targeted for January.
Thyssenkrupp is also studying the conditions that are required for a spin-off of its steel division, Europe's second-largest, a move previously flagged but dependent on government subsidies to shift the focus towards carbon neutral production.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp rose as much as 7.4%.
Corporate break-ups are in vogue amid a growing consensus that companies perform best if they are focused more closely on related business areas, as well as increasing pressure from activist hedge funds pushing them in that direction.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) all last week announced plans to spin off divisions.
More concrete plans for additional listings at Thyssenkrupp come as operating profit is expected to more than double next year, partly boosted by a broader economic recovery for its products, which also include car parts and bearings.

""However, enormous challenges remain, especially due to the semiconductor shortage and the uncertainties arising from the coronavirus pandemic,"" Merz said.
Adjusted earnings before interest and tax are expected at 1.5 billion euros to 1.8 billion euros ($1.7-$2 billion) in the 2021/22 fiscal year, up from 796 million euros a year earlier, said the conglomerate. ($1 = 0.8838 euros)

The ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (NYSE:ARKK), Wood’s main product, held fewer than 1,000 shares of Zillow at the close on Wednesday worth just $50,000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earlier this month it owned 7.1 million valued at well over $600 million.
It’s a similar story for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), which is down to about 11,200 shares of the Seattle-based property firm from about 1.4 million earlier this year. 
The rapid unwind underscores how fast the view of Wood and her firm, Ark Investment Management, has changed regarding Zillow. The famed money manager is usually known for sticking with her bets through thick and thin.
The only other fund holding Zillow is the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF), which has around 1.4 million shares -- down from more than 2 million.
Shares of Zillow have fallen about 40% in November after the company announced plans to shut down Zillow Offers, its AI-powered home-flipping operation, and reduce its workforce by roughly 25%. Wood initially bought the 10% drop that greeted the announcement before a dramatic u-turn. 
“In ARK’s view, this news is the result of execution issues associated with Zillow’s AI pricing algorithms despite its access to ample data, calling into question the high balance sheet risk necessary to enable the scaling of iBuying business models,” Ark said later that week in its regular commentary on its biggest moving shares.
A spokesperson for the firm didn’t respond to a request for comment regarding its reduced stake in the company. 
After a stellar 2020, Ark’s performance this year has been more mixed. The flagship fund ARKK has lost about 6.2%, while ARKW has returned 5.5% and ARKF is up 4%.

(Reuters) - Canadian power chip maker GaN Systems on Tuesday said it raised $150 million in a funding round led by Fidelity Management & Research as it seeks to expand its market share, including a big push into the electric car market.
While a chip shortage has been plaguing the automotive industry, GaN Systems’ Chief Executive Jim Witham said his company has secured production volume with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to continue its growth. 
BMW and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have been investors in GaN Systems for several years, and Witham said GaN recently signed its first “capacity agreement” with BMW to guarantee delivery of power chips worth over a quarter of a billion dollars. He said about 100 power chips are used in each electric vehicle.
GaN Systems uses gallium nitride (GaN), a material more recently applied for chip making that is able to achieve four times reduction in power loss compared with traditional silicon-based power chips, said Witham. While the gallium nitride chips only make up 1% of a $16 billion power chip market, Witham said they are growing fast.
“There's a big play in automotive, EV, and now's the time to really capitalize the company for that rapid growth and to gobble up market share,” said Witham.

In addition to automotive clients, Witham said, GaN Systems chips were picking up traction in power chargers for consumer goods as they are smaller and more energy efficient than silicon power chips. They are also finding use in robots, servers, industrial motors and renewable energy facilities.
Witham declined to disclose the company’s valuation.

""Each case for the supply of semiconductors will be rigorously assessed based on their respective merits, so as to ensure that a project has a European nature and of course avoid a subsidy race within the union and beyond,"" European Commission for Competition Magrethe Vestager told a news conference.

The car parts maker is one of the manufacturers under investigation on suspicion of hiding illegal levels of pollution following a regulatory clampdown on toxic fumes triggered by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s 2015 admission that it had cheated emissions tests.
The software used in the 1.6 litre diesel engine Volkswagen developed for sale in Europe came from Continental, though the supplier has said it was not involved in the manipulation as engine controls are programmed by clients themselves.
The individuals now under investigation are suspected of breach of trust, failure to fulfil supervisory duties and being an accessory to fraud, the Hanover prosecutor's office said on Thursday.
The people under investigation also include a former board member of Continental's Powertrain unit and two employees below board level, prosecutors said, without naming the persons.
""This development shook us,"" Continental's works council said in a statement.
""We at Continental are paying dearly for the focus on profit at any price. Therefore, we call for a return to what the company stands for: trust, reliability, transparency and openness. We demand a new start with more courage to be honest,"" it said.
Continental, Degenhart and Schaefer declined to comment.
Shares in Continental were down 3.3% by 1145 GMT.

Continental said late on Wednesday dismiss its Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer it would replace Schaefer as finance chief, and that Chief Executive Nikolai Setzer would take over his responsibilities for now.
The investigators had already searched Continental's compliance department in Frankfurt and a private residence that was not Schaefer's flat earlier in November, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Thursday.

(Reuters) - What's the value of being Twitter-famous? Two new stock indexes created by S&P Dow Jones Indices and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will unravel the mystery on Thursday, measuring the performance of the buzziest companies for investors with an eye on social media influence.
Twitter has long played a central role for investors and traders to share stock tips, keep up with breaking company news and follow the latest musings from CEOs like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk, who recently polled his 64 million followers on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares.
The S&P 500 Twitter Sentiment Index will measure the performance of the top 200 companies within the S&P 500 that have ""the highest sentiment scores,"" based on how the social network's users are discussing the stocks, said S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
The companies within the index will be weighted by market capitalization. A second index will measure the performance of the top 50 companies with equal weight. 
The new indexes come as tweets about finance are rising on the San Francisco-based social media site, particularly with the growth of cryptocurrencies. Finance-related conversations were up more than 26% in 2020 from the previous year, Twitter said.

S&P DJI said it will measure the Twitter sentiment of S&P 500 companies on a daily basis by analyzing tweets that contain a ""cashtag,"" a stock ticker feature that works similarly to hashtags, and scoring whether the tweets are more positive or negative. Both indices will be rebalanced monthly.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Meta Platforms Inc, the new name for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), will be among the companies in the Twitter Sentiment Index, S&P DJI said, though it declined to provide the full list.

Investing.com – Macy’s stock (NYSE:M) jumped 11% in Thursday’s premarket as ts third-quarter report suggested that the department store chain has emerged from the pandemic stronger, despite widespread and long closures of many of its stores. 
Sales and earnings both blew past estimates and the retailer raised its guidance for the full year once more, after attracting 4.4 million new customers through the three months ended October 30, on top of the 5 million it added in the second quarter.
The company now expects its full-year net sales to be $24.20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, up from $23.75 billion previously.  Average customer spending rose 16% across three segments of its loyalty program -- platinum, gold and silver. 
Both total net sales and comparable sales rose 36%. Net sales were $5.44 billion. Adjusted profit per share increased more than four times to $1.23, and was also up sharply from two years ago, the last comparable pre-pandemic number.
Separately, Macy's said it will launch a curated online marketplace to cement the gains it has made in e-commerce over the last couple of years.  
The company said sales of home goods, fragrances, jewelry, watches and sleepwear had been particularly strong, along while occasion-based items such as dresses, men’s tailoring and luggage also held up well.
Digital sales reversed their second-quarter fall, growing 19%. Despite this, digital sales as a percentage of total sales, fell by 5 percentage points year-on-year as more consumers returned to shop in person at its department stores.  "

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union stock exchanges will be forced to hand over data on market transactions on a single ""tape"" for investors to spot the cheapest deals and help the bloc compete better with London and New York, a draft EU document shows.
The reform proposal is one of many due next week from the European Commission aimed at knitting together the EU's capital markets after Britain's departure last year and at widening the use globally of the euro in finance.
Brussels wants to build ""strategic autonomy"" in financial services to rebuild its economy after COVID-19, channel money into 'green' projects, and cut reliance on London, which still clears some 90% of euro-denominated swaps.
While a ""consolidated tape"", a record of trading prices that is a feature of Wall Street, has been a longstanding goal of banks and asset managers in the face of 476 venues across the EU, many of which trade the same securities, bourses have resisted handing over the data at an affordable price.
Inefficiencies as a result of not having a tape for share prices can cost as much as 10.6 billion euros ($12 billion) a year, the document seen by Reuters said. 
There would also be mandatory contributions from exchanges to a tape for each asset class like stocks, bonds, derivatives and exchange-traded funds in return for ""fair remuneration"".
""All market data sources would have to make standardised core market data available to market data aggregators,"" the document said.
""This will reduce the information advantage that the biggest market players have compared to other market players, in particular smaller asset managers, banks and retail brokers who may not be able to afford expensive services of data vendors.""
Exchanges would be guaranteed a ""minimum revenue"" for handing over the price data, the proposal said.
Subscription fees for professional investors would be set high enough so that retail investors can be given access to the tape for free or at minimal cost.
In a further nod to exchanges, there will be amendments to ensure there is the right ""balance"" in share trading volumes on bourses and their less transparent rivals.
There will also be a review of listing rules to attract more companies to go public.
COMPETITIVE CLEARING
Brussels is accelerating efforts to improve its capital market as London takes steps to bolster its competitiveness as a global financial centre post Brexit.
The EU proposal for new legislation includes scrapping a requirement on clearing houses to handle derivatives traded on rival bourses - a move that could disadvantage London.
""The Commission deems it necessary to remove these provisions in order to foster competition... and building further clearing capability in the EU,"" the document said.
Brussels wants to expand the processing of trades to make it attractive for banks to move trillions of euros of such business from London to continental rivals such as Frankfurt.
There would also be the possibility of suspending a rule requiring EU banks to use an approved platform for trading derivatives.
EU banks in London are barred from using platforms there to trade swaps, putting them at a disadvantage to their international competitors and France wants this addressed.
The Commission also proposes banning brokers from forwarding retail client share orders to high-frequency traders for execution in return for a fee, known as payment for order flow.

Under the plans, Brussels would also create a single access point for investors to get free information on companies and financial products scattered across member states.

(Reuters) - Britain will have enough gas and electricity capacity to keep the lights on this Christmas, the boss of  National Grid  (LON:NG) said on Thursday, allaying fears of an energy crisis amid surging prices and demand.
Energy prices in Britain have soared to record highs, causing nearly two dozen energy suppliers to collapse and some industrial firms to reduce output.
""Obviously, things can happen. That's the nature of energy markets and our job is to monitor that,"" National Grid Chief Executive John Pettigrew said in an interview. ""But based on our winter outlook reports, we see sufficient capacity both on the gas and on the electricity side.""
The remarks echo those in National Gas' winter gas outlook released in October, when it said there was enough supply to meet demand this winter.
European wholesale gas and power prices have risen sharply due to lower-than-usual gas stocks this summer, reduced supply from Russia and the onset of colder temperatures.
In the UK, high wholesale gas prices have contributed to an increase in wholesale power prices, as gas plants account for around 40% of electricity generation in Britain.
Pettigrew's comments came as National Grid reported half-year financial results and lifted its annual earnings outlook, benefiting from an early commissioning of the North Sea Link electricity interconnector between Britain and Norway.
Annual underlying earnings per share growth would come in ""significantly above"" the top end of its 5%-7% outlook range, National Grid said. The forecast was also driven by higher auction prices across its interconnector portfolio.
The North Sea Link power cable worth 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) began commercial operations early last month and is expected to improve the UK's energy security.

National Grid's half-yearly underlying operating profit from continuing operations jumped 47% to 1.41 billion pounds and the firm declared an interim dividend of 17.21 pence per share.

(Reuters) - CEO turnover spiked in the first half of 2021, as companies tapped new talent to navigate the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and stressed-out chief executives sought a career change, a study from recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII) found.
The findings illustrate how CEOs are not immune to the exhaustion that has swept hundreds of millions of workers worldwide since the onset of the pandemic and has pushed many to consider a new job or lifestyle in a wave dubbed ""The Great Resignation."" 
""Our belief is that it will only accelerate going into next year as people have delayed their retirements,"" said Jeff Sanders, co-managing partner of Heidrick's global CEO and board practice.
There were 103 CEO appointments in the first half of 2021 out of 1,095 companies in 24 regions that Heidrick studied, including the United States, China and some European countries. 
Six months prior, in the second half of 2020, 49 companies changed CEOs, according to the study. 
Most companies kept their leaders in place last year as they closed ranks to deal with the challenges of the pandemic. But as it receded with the help of vaccines, companies felt they were stable enough to find a new leader, Sanders said. 
""Many CEOs didn't have to travel as much,"" which helped them preserve their energy, Sanders said. But communicating ""virtually"" in a new medium was ""exhausting,"" he said. 
The reluctance of many boards to meet CEO candidates physically or place risky bets on outsiders while the pandemic lingers favored internal applicants, the study found. Nearly two-thirds of new CEOs were internal candidates, up from just a little over half during the same period in 2020. 
Women made up 13% of the new CEOs in the first half of this year, up from 6% in the prior period in the regions the report studied.

Yet the churn did not lead to big strides in diversity, according to the study. It found that 3% of Fortune 100 CEOs are Black, 4% are Hispanic or Latino, 4% are Asian and 1% are Middle Eastern or North African, less than their share of the U.S. population. 
""I don't think (CEO diversity) is where it needs to be,"" Sanders said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Michigan dairy farmer Doug Chapin has been unable to buy bottles of veterinary penicillin for his cows for more than a month.
In Minnesota, pig farmer Randy Spronk reformulated feed rations due to a shortage of the widely used ingredient lysine, an amino acid that helps livestock grow.
Supply-chain disruptions are hitting America's meat producers and sending them scrambling for alternatives as they seek to care for farm animals and keep down costs. 
Shortages of some medications like penicillin reflect in part a competition for raw materials between people and animals, as the COVID-19 pandemic shifts demand and disrupts global trade through shipping logjams and port bottlenecks.
Supply issues, in turn, have veterinarians questioning long-standing farm practices and are forcing changes within the food sector. WH Group (OTC:WHGLY)'s Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork producer, told Reuters it has seen shortages and substituted products and manufacturers when necessary to maintain animal care.
In farm states including Iowa and Minnesota, farmers said they are struggling to find lysine, typically a cheaper feed alternative to soybean meal. 
The main supply issues surround dry lysine products out of China, said Archer-Daniels-Midland. The Chicago-based commodity trader ended dry lysine production this year and sells a liquid version.
Farmers like Spronk are feeding more soybean meal to pigs at a higher cost to replace dry lysine. The shift helped lift Chicago Board of Trade soymeal futures to a four-month high on Wednesday.
""It's to the point where literally producers are having to reformulate to pull lysine out or lower the lysine level to try to extend it,"" Spronk said. ""You can't get it."" 
SCRAMBLE FOR SUPPLIES
For medications, Chapin and his family are trying to stock up on penicillin and other products in case animals fall ill. One of the most commonly used drugs in livestock production, penicillin can treat respiratory diseases and other conditions.
""I always figured the next bottle is just a phone call away,"" Chapin said. 
Widespread penicillin shortages across the country have caused challenges for cattle and dairy operations, said Patrick Gorden, president of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. Veterinarians have struggled to find even a few bottles of Pen-G, an injectable antibiotic for treating ill cattle, sheep and swine. 
Similar shortages are emerging for some tetracyclines, a class of antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections in farm animals, veterinarians said.
""In some cases, we've looked at alternatives to therapy or had conversations as to whether this treatment is really all that effective or needed at all,"" Gorden said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists shortages of nine veterinarian drugs that began in the wake of the pandemic. The agency said it contacted manufacturers and does not know when they will resolve supply issues.
""These shortages should not limit veterinarians' ability to provide appropriate medical treatment or euthanasia to pets or livestock,"" said Jose Arce, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.
But the food and pharmaceutical sectors are feeling an impact. 
The world's largest animal-health company,  Zoetis Inc  (NYSE:ZTS), does not manufacture penicillin products but reported ""localized constraints"" on other products as the pandemic has impacted supply chains. The company declined to name these medications.
Ireland-based manufacturer Bimeda Inc has two veterinary penicillin products on FDA's drug-shortage list, including Pro-Pen-G.
North American and Chinese suppliers of an FDA-approved material used to manufacture penicillin suffered supply outages early this year, Bimeda spokeswoman Mary van Dijk said. She declined to name the material. A Chinese supplier also experienced quality issues that took about six months to resolve, she said.
Another problem is raw materials normally used to make antibiotics for animals have been diverted to manufacture amoxicillin for humans, van Dijk said. The drugs share common starting materials, and demand for human amoxicillin rose during the pandemic, she said.

Amoxicillin can be used to treat ear infections in children, sore throats and other conditions.
""The supply disruptions are not entirely solved,"" van Dijk said.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Two environmental groups on Thursday lodged a complaint against Ahold Delhaize to the Dutch market regulator, saying the supermarket group fails to meet EU reporting directives by not disclosing how much plastic packaging it uses.
The complaint is the first of its kind in the Netherlands, said environmental law charity ClientEarth and Dutch NGO Plastic Soup Foundation, sent to the country's Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).
Ahold is ""failing to disclose key information on its use of plastics and for failing to report plastic-related risk to its investors, in breach of its legal requirements,"" they said in a statement sent to Reuters.
In response, Ahold told Reuters it reports on environmental matters to the UK's Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It said it is taking steps to reduce plastic use at its stores, and ""will work towards disclosing quantitative progress on plastics and packaging in its annual reports.""
With more than 7,000 stores in 10 countries, Ahold Delhaize is a leading supermarket operator in the Benelux and U.S. east coast, where it owns the Stop & Shop, Food Lion, Giant and Hannaford chains.
The EU's 1995 Non-Financial Reporting Directive requires large companies to report material information on environmental issues which potentially pose a financial risk to their business.
AFM said in a statement to Reuters it has encouraged companies to voluntarily report on non-financial issues since 2013, and oversees compliance with the EU directive.
Since 2017, public companies with more than 500 employees ""have been obliged to report on non-financial (matters) in their management reports as part of their annual reporting,"" it said. 
AFM said it can order a company to publicly correct a ""material deficiency"" in reporting, but lacks the power to impose fines in such cases.

Roughly 300 million tons of plastic waste are produced annually, nearly equal to the weight of the entire human population, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.
With companies increasingly urged to be more environmentally friendly, Ahold should be more transparent about its plastic use, the NGOs said. ""Yet Ahold Delhaize has not disclosed this information to investors - which is a breach of EU law.""

Investing.com – ADRs of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) traded 2.3% higher in Thursday’s premarket as heavy online shopping on its platform helped the company beat estimates for sales and profit in the third quarter.
Net revenue for the September quarter was RMB219 billion ($134 billion), up around 26% on the year, as the second wave of the pandemic kept people indoors in China, leading people to shop online for groceries, furniture, books and electronics.
Sales in the company's product segment, which includes online retail sales, rose 23%. Revenue from services, comprising around 15% of the total, rose over 43%.
JD.com closed September at 552 million annual active customer accounts, 25% higher from a year ago.
Adjusted profit per ADR more than halved to 49 cents as marketing expenses, higher procurement and warehousing charges and share-based compensation to staff offset the revenue growth.
The company had earlier reported strong sales at its annual Singles' Day online sales fest. The platform recorded 349.1 billion yuan worth of transactions, up around 29% from the previous year.
That compared to a more subdued performance at larger rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) which saw its gross merchandise volume up 8.5% to 540.3 billion yuan ($84.5 billion), the first time in history growth at China’s largest ecommerce platform slowed below 10%.

Investing.com – Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 6% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the chipmaker’s sales and profit raced past estimates in the third quarter.
Data centers and gaming led the momentum in the third quarter, much the same way they have over the last several quarters, driven by the pandemic-induced shifts in work and leisure practices. Demand for gaming has boomed while data centers have expanded as businesses and consumers make online an integral part of their lives. With those trends showing little sign of waning, the company's outlook was accordingly optimistic.
The company said revenue in the fourth quarter should hit $7.4 billion, after rising 50% year-on-year to $7.1 billion in the quarter ended October 31. The company largely overcame the supply chain problems that have plagued other manufacturers in the industry.
Revenue from data centers was a record $2.94 billion and so were $3.22 billion in sales of gaming chips, the two segments growing 55% and 42%, respectively.
The company is now training its eyes on the so-called metaverse, a term for interconnected virtual worlds. The company’s software platform, Omniverse, enables 3D online spaces.
With Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (previously known as Facebook) and others betting billions on the virtual space, Nvidia expects large revenues from applications that need more computing power.

(NYSE:JPM) economists said they now expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next September, becoming the latest on Wall Street to jettison a forecast for the central bank to stay on hold through 2022. 
In a new outlook published to clients late Wednesday, JPMorgan’s U.S. economists led by Michael Feroli said that by the middle of next year the central bank’s goal of full employment will be satisfied. 
That will prompt the Fed’s policy-setting Open Market Committee to raise its benchmark rate from near zero in September with a further hike in December and one every subsequent quarter, the economists said. They predicted the increases will stop once the inflation-adjusted rate is back at zero.
“When the facts change, the FOMC changes its mind,” said Feroli and colleagues. 
Economists are still sounding more dovish than investors. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists said last month that they expect the central bank to raise rates in July. Their counterparts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) still see the Fed not shifting rates throughout next year. 
The JPMorgan economists also said they believe Chair Jerome Powell will be reappointed for another four-year term by President Joe Biden.

The FINMA watchdog contacted 30 Swiss banks during its investigation. It has already taken issue with two former chief executives of private bank Julius Baer and rapped  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) for anti-corruption failings.
FINMA has now reprimanded five banks in total since the investigation began in 2016.
In the final case disclosed on Thursday, the regulator criticized Banca Zarattini & Co SA and CBH Compagnie Bancaire Helvétique SA. 
FINMA found that both Banca Zarattini in the period between 2014 and 2018 and CBH Bank between 2012 and 2020 breached obligations to combat money laundering and their duties to implement appropriate risk management policy, a serious infringement of supervisory law, FINMA said.
""Both banks failed to carry out sufficient economic background clarifications into business relationships and transactions with increased money-laundering risks. Adequate documentation was also lacking in these areas,"" it said.
FINMA imposed a temporary ban on accepting new Venezuelan and politically exposed persons as clients on Banca Zarattini. The measures imposed on CBH Bank include the termination of all remaining business relationships with Venezuelan clients. 
In addition, CBH must review other especially risky client relationships and terminate these if necessary, FINMA said.
Banca Zarattini said it contacted the regulator as soon as it became aware of potential problems and cooperated extensively with the inquiry. It had since improved its anti-money laundering and compliance systems.
""The bank accepts without reserves the conclusions reached by the supervisory authority in relation to the shortcomings found in the way the bank combats money laundering, highlighting that these shortcomings only refer to a limited period of time and a limited number of relationships with Venezuelan clients,"" it said.

In a separate statement, CBH noted FINMA had not imposed sanctions against the bank or staff and that the bank had already taken decisions that address the restrictions FINMA imposed.

CALEDON, South Africa (Reuters) - South African Breweries (SAB), part of Anheuser Busch InBev, is betting new drought-resistant barley varieties will help it maintain record annual production in its major domestic beer market and meet demand elsewhere on the continent, officials said.
The world's largest brewer is betting hi-tech natural cultivars and enhanced farming techniques in Africa will eliminate barley and malt shortages dampening expansion plans.
""No barley, no beer. So, absolutely critical to have a sustainable supply chain of barley,"" said Josh Hammann, Africa director for agriculture development and sustainability at AB InBev in Africa.
Scientists say dryer conditions in South Africa due to global warming could diminish barley production in Caledon, the country's main growing area, where AB Inbev also converts barley into malt at its flagship 180,000 tonne factory.
Malt is currently imported from Europe only when local production volumes do not meet quality parameters or if there is a crop failure due to drought. But, the long-term plan is to eventually export larger quantities of malt as barley harvests yield more, with Africa the main export target market, said company officials.
By using drought-resistant barley and improved agronomics, Hammann said AB Inbev surpassed a target of reaching 475,000 metric tonnes of barley output by 2021, with a record harvest of 560,000 tonnes achieved in the 2020 season when rains were good.
""It's very important for us as AB Inbev to localise our production and our raw materials... to help mitigate against global risks,"" Hammann told Reuters at a barley research farm in Caledon, about 110 km (68 miles) from Cape Town, where wind-swept barley fields ripening for October's harvest stretch as far as the eye can see.

Researchers are also experimenting with new maize, sorghum and cassava crop cultivars to meet burgeoning spirit brewing prospects in Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Scientists are excited about their latest barley cultivar, Kadie, which has a high-yield potential, a high percentage of kernel plumpness and ripens quicker than other varieties in dry lands.
""It's quick, it's short and has the X-factor,"" Daniel de Klerk, a barely breeder at the research institute, said of the new variety. Kadie might be considered for use in Budweiser and if successfully tested could become the first African barley variety used for the popular American brew, officials said.

Business daily Handelsblatt reported separately that Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) was also considering a spin-off of T-Systems, which it has already discussed with the German government, which owns a 30.5% stake of Deutsche Telekom.
In any spin-off, Deutsche Telekom and the German government would each hold a third of T-Systems, while the remaining third would be sold to investors, Handelsblatt said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Deutsche Telekom was not immediately available for comment on the report. A spokesperson for T-Systems said the company had plans for growth but was also looking into other options.

While the telecoms business has been performing well, T-Systems has been underperforming, with incoming orders declining by 25% during the coronavirus crisis.
Last year, Deutsche Telekom's finance chief Christian Illek said that reduced IT spending by the automotive and airline industries would necessitate additional restructuring at T-Systems on top of an ongoing three-year turnaround plan.

Investing.com – Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell 6% in Thursday’s premarket as the company’s forecast of no more than 6.5% revenue growth in the current quarter disappointed.
Consensus forecasts had been for guidance of around 7%, according to Bloomberg, but the maker of networking gear warned that it could be as little as 4.5%.
Cisco has had a constant battle with components shortages and supply chain disruptions in recent months as Delta variant Covid-19 created sporadic but sometimes lengthy lockdowns in major manufacturing hubs in China and southeast Asia. Production schedules have gone awry due to labor crunches and rising wages. Congestion at ports has delayed deliveries.
“There’s no question that the Q2 guide is impacted by the supply chain, the component supply issues that are putting a headwind on what we can get out the door,” Chief Financial Officer R. Scott Herren said during a conference call.
Cisco hiked product prices in September to protect its margins as the company has also had to pay more upfront to secure supplies and meet demand for its networking gear
On an adjusted basis, gross margin in the product business contracted by 150 basis points to 63.8% (one basis point is a hundredth of a percent). While the company has been trying to build a subscription-led services business, products still contribute around three-fourths to its top line.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s management expects greater supply-chain predictability by the end of its financial year in July.

By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - A slew of plane orders at this week's Dubai Airshow has added weight to Airbus' hopes of raising output, but the jetmaker is not yet ready to pull the trigger, its top executive said.
Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) bagged 265 firm orders at the Middle East event, closing a gap with Boeing (NYSE:BA) which had been leading this year as sales of its 737 MAX rebound from a safety crisis.
A further 139 provisional orders lifted Airbus' Dubai tally above 400 jets, while Boeing won a firm order for 72 MAX.
CEO Guillaume Faury said Airbus had definitively agreed to increase production to 65 single-aisle jets a month by summer 2023, from a planned average of 45 this quarter.
Beyond that, Airbus has asked suppliers to explore rates of 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025, but has not made a decision.
Some suppliers have criticised the plans, worried the pandemic recovery will remain patchy.
""We are in the phase of assessing demand,"" Faury told Reuters in an interview this week.
""What happened (in Dubai) is important, because together with other prospects or deals to come, it gives substance and ... evidence that the demand we see for rate 70, 75 will be sustained for many years.""
That ""inside-out"" view of demand - based on orders Airbus is receiving and its own assumptions based on talks with airlines - matches the ""outside-in"" or top-down picture provided by new Airbus market forecasts published at the show, he said.
NOT THERE YET
The forecasts cover 20 years and straddle categories, so cannot easily be used to gauge near-term output of a specific model. But Faury said the latest report was consistent with demand for ""maybe 70, 75"" A320-family jets a month this decade.
""So if those simulation tools and those sensors continue to be as robust as they have demonstrated in the past, we think 70, 75 is reasonable, but we're not yet there,"" Faury said.
Industry sources say Airbus intends to take a decision by the middle of next year to leave time for suppliers to react.
Faury said he had received encouraging signals during recent talks with French and German supplier groups.
Privately, some suppliers are less optimistic. ""I think most still believe it will be bumpy,"" a senior industry source said.
Airbus deliveries have flattened in the past three months, in part due to snags in the supply chain.
Faury said the overall burden on the supply chain had eased, however, because of a drop in demand for wide-body jets.
He declined to be drawn on a recent row with engine makers who oppose plans to raise monthly A320-family output beyond 65 in order to leave space for repair revenues on older planes that might otherwise be pushed into early retirement.
Faury said he respected their concerns, as well as those of lessors, and any decisions would be made ""as a community"".

Airbus appears worried disputes over output plans will deter suppliers from making investments needed to reach the first step of 65 a month, roughly where output was pre-pandemic.
""We are going to 65: that is decided ... We are executing this. But we have not decided anything beyond,"" Faury said.

(Reuters) -U.S. private equity firm Carlyle said on Thursday talks about a possible takeover offer for Metro Bank have ended, sending shares in the British lender tumbling 16%.
Metro Bank announced the takeover approach from Carlyle earlier this month.
""The board continues to strongly believe in the standalone strategy and future prospects of Metro Bank,"" the lender said in response to Carlyle's announcement. 
Neither company gave any reasons for the negotiations falling through.
Shares in Metro Bank, which had a market capitalisation of 227 million pounds ($306.6 million) at Wednesday's close, fell 16% to 110.8 pence at 0830 GMT.
The bank's share price had jumped on the announcement of the takeover talks, but has halved since February 2020 as it and other mid-sized lenders struggled with low interest rates and competition.
Metro Bank has been working to turn around its fortunes after a major accounting error in 2019 forced out its top bosses and led to a significant share price fall.
Metro Bank, which was launched more than a decade ago to challenge Britain's incumbent high street lenders, has struggled to generate profits from a growing deposit base.
But its losses narrowed in July as Britain's economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had left smaller banks more vulnerable compared with their larger and more diverse rivals as interest rates hit record lows.
John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody, said the bank was on track to return to profitability in 2023 under its own turnaround plan.

""There is also, of course, the prospect that other would-be buyers emerge from the woodwork in the wake of the Carlyle approach,"" he said in a note.

PARIS (Reuters) - Drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) is investing $180 million in French startup Owkin, whose predictive algorithms aim to improve the research and development of new cures against cancer, the Paris-based group said on Thursday. 
The deal gives Sanofi a stake between 10 and 15% in Owkin, company co-founder and CEO Thomas Clozel said, and turns Owkin into a ""unicorn"" -- a startup company valued at more than $1 billion. 
The transaction, steered by Sanofi's chief digital officer, Arnaud Robert, also includes a partnership, under which Owkin agreed to build prognostic models and help evaluate the response to treatment against four types of cancer via its platform. 
Sanofi said it would pay $90 million upfront for the first three years of collaboration with Owkin. The pharmaceutical group will make additional payments if Owkin's biomedical models prove successful. 
""It's our biggest deal,"" Clozel, a clinical research doctor, said. ""It shows the confidence of a pharma in our technology and platform: They understand their importance for drug discovery and clinical trials.""
Owkin's prior investors notably includes GV, formerly Google Ventures, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's venture capital arm, which took part in the company's $75 million previous fundraising. 
Owkin doesn't say how much GV invested, nor does it disclose its finances. 
Owkin, also based in Paris, has developed its algorithms and artificial intelligence platform by dispatching them in medical and research centres. It installs and operates servers locally in each of the centres that agreed to give access to their data -- the indispensable raw material from which Owkin's algorithms sharpen their analytical capabilities. 

This means that the pools of data aren't centralised on a single platform and remain instead in the hands of each individual hospital or research centre, Owkin says.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early on Thursday as investors digested the region’s growing inflationary pressures as well as positive updates from Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG),  National Grid  (LON:NG) and  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG).  
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, but the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.
Thyssenkrupp stock rose 3.8% after the German engineering and steel group predicted its operating profit could more than double next year as its recovery continues. The conglomerate also indicated it is considering listing its hydrogen unit in an initial public offering. Elsewhere in Germany,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) stock rose 2.1% and BMW (DE:BMWG) stock rose 1.4% as investors priced in expectations that the 30% year-on-year drop in European car sales in October will be the bottom of the cycle. 
Additionally, Royal Mail stock climbed 6.9% after the postal group said it would return 400 million pounds ($539.84 million) to shareholders following a strong first half in which more people shopped online, boosting its parcel delivery business.
National Grid (LON:NG) stock rose 0.7% after the power transmission service lifted its outlook for the year, benefiting from an early commissioning of the North Sea Link electricity interconnector between Britain and Norway.
The major equity indices in Europe have pushed to record levels, with the DAX and the CAC 40 posting all-time highs Thursday, boosted by strong corporate earnings, but concerns are growing about the region’s inflationary outlook and the impact this could have on monetary policy.
Eurozone inflation surged 4.1% year-on-year in October, data revealed Wednesday, more than twice the European Central Bank's target. At the same time, the equivalent U.K. number came in at 4.2%, its highest in almost a decade.
The ECB has repeatedly said that these price pressures should ease next year, but is coming under increased pressure to abandon its ultra easy monetary policy and tackle price growth.
Its own Financial Stability Review warned on Wednesday that increasingly stretched prices in property and financial markets, risk-taking by non-banks and elevated borrowing pose a threat to the region’s stability.
Over in the U.K., the Bank of England is widely expected to become the first of the G7 central banks to raise interest rates in the wake of the pandemic, probably in December.
The day’s major economic data release comes from the U.S., with the weekly initial jobless claims numbers set to provide another look at the state of the country’s labor market. 
Crude prices fell overnight, continuing the sharp losses of the previous session, following a Reuters report that the U.S. is trying to arrange a coordinated release of strategic reserves by a number of major crude consumers in order to bring prices down.
China's state reserve bureau confirmed Thursday that it was working on a release of crude oil reserves. 
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $76.89 a barrel, after dropping 3% during the last session, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $79.81, after falling 1.7% on Wednesday. Both benchmarks recorded their lowest settlement levels since early October. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,867.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1330.

Toyoda, a member of Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's founding family, has served as the head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association since 2018. Most past chairpersons have served a single two-year term.
""I accepted the role after receiving views that (the industry) needs continuity ... to overcome this difficult stage,"" Toyoda told an online news conference.
With governments around the world tightening emissions regulations to rein in global warming, the auto industry is under pressure to transition to zero emissions but there is disagreement over how to get there.
At the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow last week, six major carmakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Volvo and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz signed a declaration to phase out fossil-fuel cars by 2040.

Toyota declined to join that group, arguing that much of the world is not ready for a shift to EVs. Another notable absence was Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
While some brands have announced plans to go all-electric in the coming years, Toyota has pushed for a mix of technologies including hydrogen and plug-in hybrids as the most practical approach.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group is selling its entire stake in streaming services firm HengTen Network Group for HK$2.13 billion ($273.5 million), as the cash-strapped developer boosts efforts to avoid a debilitating default on its debts.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, said on Thursday it would book a loss of HK$8.5 billion from selling the 18% stake in HengTen, in which Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) holds around a 20% share. 
The Shenzhen-based real estate company has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.
A wholly owned unit of Evergrande entered into an agreement with Allied Resources Investment Holdings Ltd, owned by investor Li Shao Yu, to sell 1.66 billion HengTen shares at HK$1.28 per share, at a discount of 24% to its closing price on Wednesday.
The latest share disposal extends Evergrande's sell-down of its HangTen stake from 26.55% in the secondary market since early this month. 
Shares of Evergrande dropped 5% in afternoon trade, while HengTen, which streams and produces film and television programmes and has been described as China's Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) by Chinese media, jumped 23%.
Evergrande's bonds due March 2022 rose 1.997 cents to 32.2 on the dollar, according to Duration Finance.
The developer said in the filing that 20% of the deal consideration will be payable within five business days from the date of the agreement, while the remainder will be completed within two months.
Investors are on tenterhooks as they wait to see if Evergrande, which failed to pay coupons totalling $82.5 million due on Nov. 6, can meet its obligations before the 30-day grace period expires on Dec 6. 
Other Chinese property developers are also stepping up financing efforts via share sales as liquidity in the offshore bond market dries up due to fears over any contagion from Evergrande's troubles.
Country Garden Services Holdings, the property services unit of top developer Country Gardens, raised $1 billion on Thursday from placing 4.5% of enlarged shares, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The company sold 150 million new shares at HK$53.35 each, a 9.5% discount to the last traded price of HK$58.95 on Wednesday. Its shares were suspended from trading on Thursday, while those of parent Country Garden dropped 4.3%.
Smaller rival Agile Group also said on Thursday it sold convertible bonds worth HK$2.4 billion based on the initial exchange price of HK$27.48 per share of its property management unit A-Living Smart City Services.
Shares of A-Living tumbled 8.3% to HK$21 on Thursday.
Agile said it has remitted funds to repay its $190 million senior notes due Thursday. 
LIQUIDITY SQUEEZE
""The market has expected fund raising activities in the sector because if mainland China does not loosen liquidity, it'll be difficult for the property firms to get large loans from financial institutions,"" said Castor Pang, head of research of Core Pacific in Hong Kong, adding that slowing home sales also hurt developers' cashflow. 
The new issuance followed a share sale and a stake disposal in its property management unit by Sunac China, among the top four developers in the country, early this week, raising a total of $949.70 million.
CIFI Holdings also raised $214.5 million via a rights issue earlier in November, while Shimao Services raised a total of HK$4.8 billion via a new share placement as well as convertible bonds.
On top of the debt market pressures, Chinese property developers are also facing stiff challenges from an array of unprecedented policy tightening steps by Beijing to curb speculative buying. 
China Vanke told its staff on Tuesday they need to raise their ""crisis awareness"" and cut unnecessary spending akin to being in ""war time"", according to a person with direct knowledge. 
Last week, Evergrande once again averted a destabilising default with a last-minute bond payment but the reprieve did little to alleviate strains in the country's wider property sector from a liquidity crunch.
Evergrande has new coupon payments totalling more than $255 million due on Dec. 28. It has come under pressure from its other creditors at home and a stifling funding squeeze has cast a shadow over hundreds of its residential projects.
Chinese authorities have urged Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan, 63, to use some of his personal wealth to help pay bondholders, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last month.

Its founder is now freeing up funds from luxury assets including art, calligraphy and three high-end homes, according to filings and a person with knowledge of the matter.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 01:26AM ET</span>",UK's Arrival unveils pre-production prototype electric bus,"By Nick Carey
BANBURY, England (Reuters) - British electric van and bus maker Arrival on Thursday unveiled a new prototype of an electric bus that it hopes to begin producing next year to sell at around the price of a conventional diesel bus.
The pre-production bus will start running on roads within the next few weeks, and series production is due to begin at a plant in the U.S. state of South Carolina in the second quarter.
In a tour of the bus for Reuters, company president Avinash Rugoobur highlighted the fact that, because the batteries are in the floor - some electric buses place them in the ceiling - the bus has a skylight running the vehicle's length. The bus is also low to the ground for easy passenger access. 
The company uses lightweight but durable plastic composite body panels rather than steel or aluminium to lower production costs.
Arrival's system monitors every vehicle component in real time and can upgrade the software associated with any of them wirelessly, Rugoobur said. 
""Knowing and understanding how the vehicle is running in real time and being able to optimise that further reduces your fleet costs,"" he said. ""All of this in a bus that is cheaper than any other electric bus out there and competitive with diesel.""
Depending on the market, electric buses can cost up to 50% more than a diesel equivalent.
Arrival's earlier prototype buses have already been undergoing trials with First Bus, one of the UK's largest bus operators. 
Arrival says around 12% of the 64,000 vehicles it currently has non-binding orders or letters of intent for are buses. Its South Carolina plant should have annual production capacity of 10,000 units and executives say they will announce more plants soon. 
The electric bus market is heating up as countries, states and cities push towards zero-emission transport. 
Companies like California startup Proterra Inc are vying with China's BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd, or Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Mobility, a British unit of commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland Ltd, said this week it would provide 300 electric buses to the public transport agency in the Indian city of Bengaluru.
The U.S. Congress has just approved $1 trillion in infrastructure spending that includes $5.25 billion for electric buses through 2026, dwarfing the $130 million the government spent on electric transit bus programs in 2020.

Mike Ableson, head of Arrival's North American operations, said that funding will help make electric buses more affordable for cash-strapped local authorities - but that the company's goal of producing a zero-emission bus for the same price as a diesel bus will change that equation anyway. 
""Transit agencies won't have to worry about additional funding, they'll just be able to start buying electric buses instead of diesel buses,"" Ableson said.

Indigenous heritage protection has become a hot button issue globally since miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) legally destroyed culturally significant rock shelters for an iron ore mine 18 months ago, sparking public outrage.
Resource-rich Western Australia unveiled its long-awaited revamp of heritage protection laws on Wednesday, but kept the final say over development decisions with a government minister, drawing criticism from Aboriginal groups.
Australian pension fund HESTA, the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), Regnan, the advisor to fund manager Pendal, and UK-based investment company abrdn pointed to opposition to the bill by traditional owners.
""There is emerging consensus among representatives of First Nations peoples and the Responsible Investment industry that this version of the Western Australia bill sets the bar below international standards,"" said Mary Delahunty, Head of Impact at HESTA.
Rock shelters that Rio destroyed at Juukan Gorge showed evidence of human habitation stretching back 46,000 years into the last Ice Age.
""Since Juukan Gorge drew their attention, global investors who are increasingly sensitive to such issues will be looking for whether Western Australia's response properly prioritises human rights in cultural heritage,"" Regnan head of advisory Susheela Peres da Cosa said in a statement. 
""This bill is unlikely to meet their expectations.""
The state premier's department said on Wednesday it will focus on reaching agreement with Aboriginal groups and on obtaining full, prior and informed consent for development.
An Australian inquiry into the Juukan Gorge destruction recommended a new national legal framework and for Aboriginal people to be the top decision makers on heritage issues. 
  Danielle Welsh-Rose, an ESG director at abrdn, said she was concerned the bill ""may not meet the standard for genuine free, prior and informed consent.""

Western Australia produces more than half of the world's traded iron ore, a key steel-making ingredient and Australia's most lucrative export.

This drop is in contrast to the trend of recent Indian internet IPOs that soared on their first day.
The company’s shares fell as much as 19% to 1,706.15 rupees ($23.95) before paring losses, compared with the IPO price of 2,150 rupees, the top end of the marketed range in the country’s largest initial public offering. Paytm raised about $2.5 billion in the sale in which retail investors bid for nearly twice the number of shares that were available.   
Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Ltd. initiated coverage on the company with an underperform rating and a price target of 1,200 rupees, implying an over 40% downside from the issue price. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and sovereign wealth funds such as that of Singapore were among anchor investors in the issue.
“We believe Paytm’s business model lacks focus and direction,” analysts Suresh Ganapathy and Param Subramanian wrote in a report issued before the trading debut. “Unless Paytm lends, it can’t make significant money by merely being a distributor. We therefore question its ability to achieve scale with profitability.”
Paytm was founded two decades ago by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who pioneered digital payments in a predominantly cash-transacting country of 1.3 billion people. The name, short for Pay Through Mobile, rhymes with ATM. 
IPOs in the South Asian nation have raised about $15 billion so far this year, already an annual record by total proceeds. Companies that started trading in 2021 rose by an average of 23% in their first session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Nov. 15.
The market debut of Paytm, backed by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa), SoftBank Group Corp. and Ant Group Co., comes in a standout year for India’s internet startups which have attracted billions of dollars from global investors.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Virgin Australia said on Thursday it would add seven more Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 NG planes to its fleet, nearly restoring it to pre-pandemic levels, to help meet a goal of obtaining a one-third share of Australia's domestic travel market.
Australia's second-largest airline said the agreed letters of intent would give it a fleet of 84 737 NGs, just one shy of the 85 it operated before it entered voluntary administration last year and handed back many of its planes to lessors. 
The carrier, now owned by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, competes against Qantas Airways Ltd and Regional Express Holdings Ltd (Rex) in a domestic market that is beginning to recover as states open their borders.
""This fleet growth underlines the confidence we have in the future of our business and the industry generally,"" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Jayne Hrdlicka said in a statement. ""Vaccination rates are rising, borders are opening, and demand is returning.""
The airline said that all staff would be back at work by next month and that it would recruit for another 600 roles across the business. Many employees had been placed on unpaid leave because of lack of demand.
Qantas will also bring back all staff by next month at a time when it has reported a surge in bookings as states open their borders. 
Rex this week announced plans to start flights on the highly-trafficked Sydney-Brisbane and Melbourne-Brisbane routes from next month.

Rex said it would offer one-way fares as low as A$69 ($50.16), in a challenge to mid-market Virgin Australia and Qantas' low-cost arm Jetstar.

Huarong intends to issue a maximum of 39.22 billion domestic shares and not more than 1.96 billion shares listed on the Hong Kong exchange to a consortium of investors including Citic Group, China Cinda Asset Management and China Life Insurance, among others.
""It is of the view that the Issuance is the only practical measure to solve the capital insufficiency difficulty of the company and to satisfy the regulatory requirement,"" Huarong said in the filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The deal would allow Citic Group to assume the Chinese government's controlling stake in the embattled asset manager as part of a plan by regulators to fold financially shaky state asset managers into financial holding groups. 
Citic Group would subscribe to no more than 18.82 billion shares in Huarong while China Cinda, in a separate statement, said it would contribute about 4 billion yuan to pick up a 4.89% stake in Huarong.
Huarong, one of the four state distressed debt managers and counts China's finance ministry as its largest shareholder, had missed a March deadline for filing its 2020 earnings, sparking a rout in its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that spread to other Chinese issuers. 
Bonds rebounded in August after the state-backed rescue plan, and its divestment deals amid a regulatory push to sell non-core assets as part of its business revamp, Reuters has reported.
In its Wednesday statement, Huarong said that it would sell its 40.5% stake Huarong Xiangjiang Bank, and 79.9% stake in its financial leasing unit. It previously revealed similar divestment plans in consumer finance unit, and securities unit.
On Tuesday, Huarong has been granted approval to raise 70 billion yuan of financial bonds in the interbank market, as it continues to recover its credit profile and re-focus on its main bad loan business.

In August, Huarong announced a first-half 2021 profit of 158.3 million yuan ($24.5 million) and a nearly $16 billion loss for 2020.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At 27, Vijay Shekhar Sharma was making 10,000 rupees ($134.30) a month, a modest salary that did not help his marriage prospects.
""In 2004-05, my father asked me to shut my company and take up a job even if it was for 30,000 rupees,"" Sharma, who went on to found digital payments firm Paytm in 2010, told Reuters.
At the time, the trained engineer sold mobile content via a small company.
""Families of prospective brides would never call us back after finding out that I earn around 10,000 rupees a month,"" Sharma said. ""I had become an ineligible bachelor for my family.""
Last week, the 43-year-old Sharma led Paytm's $2.5 billion initial public offering (IPO). The fintech firm has become the toast of a new India, where the first-generation of the country's startups are making stellar stock market debuts and minting new millionaires. 
Born to a school teacher father and a home maker mother in a small city in India's most populous Uttar Pradesh state, Sharma, who became India's youngest billionaire in 2017, still loves having tea at a roadside cart and often takes short morning walks to buy milk and bread.
""For a long time my parents had no idea what their son was doing,"" Sharma said of the time China's Ant Group first invested in Paytm in 2015. ""Once my mother read about my net worth in a Hindi newspaper and asked me, 'Vijay do you really have the kind of money they say you have?'""
Forbes puts Sharma's net worth at $2.4 billion. 
""WHAT ARE MY ODDS?""
Paytm began just over a decade ago as a mobile recharge company and grew quickly after ride-hailing firm Uber (NYSE:UBER) listed it as a quick payment option in India. Its use leapfrogged in 2016 when India's shock ban on high-value currency notes boosted digital payments.
Paytm, which also counts SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) as its backers, has since branched out into services including insurance and gold sales, movie and flight ticketing, and bank deposits and remittances.
While Paytm pioneered digital payments in India, the space soon became crowded as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), WhatsApp and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s PhonePe launched payment services to grab a slice of a market expected to grow to more than $95.29 trillion by the end of March 2025, according to EY.
That push by global giants gave Sharma a rare moment of doubt, which he raised with SoftBank's tycoon billionaire founder Masayoshi Son.
""I called up Masa and said - now everyone's here, what do you think are my odds?""
Son, an early investor in Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), told Sharma to ""raise more money, double down and go all in"" and focus all his energy on building payments, unlike rivals which had other primary businesses.
Sharma, who is married and has a son, said he has never looked backed since.
While some market analysts have concerns over when Paytm will turn profitable, Sharma is confident of his company's success.
In 2017, Paytm launched a bill payments app in Canada and a year later entered Japan with a mobile wallet.

""My dream is to take the Paytm flag to San Francisco, New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. And when people see it they say - you know what, that's an Indian company,"" Sharma said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning. Concerns that central banks will become more hawkish in their monetary policies to curb inflation, and impact the economic recovery from COVID-19, also dampened investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.84% by 21:55 PM ET (2:55 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.18%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.13%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.46%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.39% and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.03%, with China Evergrande Group saying that it would sell its stake in HengTen Networks Group for $273 million.
U.S.-China relations were also in the spotlight, with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warning that tensions between the two countries over Taiwan could lead to a ""mishap or miscalculation.” U.S. President Joe Biden also raised the need for conversations on nukes during his virtual summit meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping earlier in the week.
Treasuries steadied after ending higher during the previous session, with an auction of 20-year notes finishing below expectations.
U.S. inflation hit a record 30-year high in October, as indicated by data released during the previous week. This has raised concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin asset tapering and hike interest rates faster than expected in response.
“With these most recent inflation readings, there is some concern that the Fed will reduce the amount of purchases, in other words, accelerate asset tapering. That would be a surprise to markets and could induce some volatility,” State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist Michael Arone told Bloomberg.
Investors also await U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision on who will chair the Fed after incumbent Chairman Jerome Powell’s term expires in February 2022. Powell and Fed Governor Lael Brainard are currently in the running for the job.
Although both candidates hold similar opinions on monetary policy, Brainard is expected to be a bit more dovish, which means “longer-term rates would be lower for longer,” helping technology stocks, said Arone.
Investors now await comments from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly at the Asia Economic Policy Conference, due to take place on Friday."

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden climbed behind the wheel of an electric Hummer SUV on Wednesday and sped off with a screeching of tires, in a test drive to tout billions of dollars in electric vehicle investment.
""Anyone want to jump in the back, or on the roof?"" Biden asked reporters after taking a few laps at a General Motors plant. ""These suckers are something else!""
The test drive, at a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit, the largest city in Michigan, was part of a nationwide White House tour promoting the $1 trillion infrastructure bill Biden, a Democrat, signed into law on Monday. 
The law provides $7.5 billion in funding to build out the nation's electric vehicle charging network, investments the industry says will inspire more Americans to buy electric vehicles, and manufacturers to produce them. Electric vehicle sales accounted for just 1.8% of the U.S. new vehicle market in 2020. 
In Detroit, Biden lavished praise on Detroit's Big Three automakers, especially GM, for embracing EVs.
""In the auto industry, Detroit's leading the world in electric vehicles,"" Biden said. He did not mention Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the U.S. automaker that accounts for nearly 80% of U.S. EV sales but is not unionized.
""You know, up until now, China has been leading in this race,"" Biden said, speaking about EV manufacturing. ""That's about to change"" because of infrastructure law, he said. 
Biden's approval ratings have dropped as inflation increases, and Democrats are promoting the bi-partisan bill as proof the party can deliver in a divided America. Michigan is a key political battleground state in U.S. elections.
NEXT UP, THOUSANDS IN EV TAX CREDITS 
Biden also touted his proposed $2 trillion social safety net spending plan being debated in Washington.The bill contains up to $12,500 in tax credits for U.S.-made EVs, including a $4,500 credit for union-made vehicles. 
The bill is a key pillar of Biden's domestic agenda but progressive and moderate lawmakers in his party have not yet agreed on what exactly should be in it. 
Biden stressed Wednesday the ""Build Back Better"" bill would be paid for by increasing taxes on corporations, turning to GM CEO Mary Barra to make his point that big companies are not paying as much as they should.
""Guess (NYSE:GES) what? They ain't paying enough,"" Biden said. ""Sorry Mary.""

With Americans jittery over inflation and the prospect of a shortage of goods during the holiday season, Biden said he had been assured by executives of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) that they would have plenty of items to buy despite supply-chain woes.
""Their inventories are up and they’ll have all the toys, food and other items that shoppers are looking for in the holiday season. That’s going to happen,"" he said.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street sees first Fed climate change review in 2023,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While the U.S. Federal Reserve trails other major central banks in tackling climate change, it's catching up on a critical front: figuring out if rising temperatures could topple a major bank or even the entire financial system. 
The potential effects of climate change - namely through rising sea levels, worsening floods and fires, and government policies transitioning away from carbon-heavy industry - could destroy trillions of dollars of assets around the globe. As major lenders to the oil and gas industry, U.S. banks could be in the eye of the storm, according to regulators and risk management experts.
A U.S. Treasury Department-led report warned last month that rising temperatures were an ""emerging threat"" to financial stability and said regulators should use scenario analyses to build robust predictive risk-management tools.
Despite being the most influential central bank in the world, the Fed has long lagged its peers in getting a grip on those risks. 
Over the past year, however, the Fed has ramped up pressure on big banks to scan their portfolios for climate change risks and could be in a position to run a formal scenario analysis and release broad findings to the public in 2023, according to seven industry executives with direct knowledge of the discussions who declined to be named. 
The previously unreported growing industry consensus shows how regulators are trying to move quickly to execute President Joe Biden's agenda to incorporate climate risk into the financial regulatory system, with major ramifications for Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
A formal climate change scenario analysis would give regulators and investors the clearest picture yet of big banks' exposure to climate change, and increase pressure on the industry to make good on pledges cemented at this month's U.N. climate summit to transition away from fossil-fuel lending. 
""Right now there really isn't any data about the scale and magnitude, or really, system-wide risks,"" said Todd Phillips, a director at think tank the Center for American Progress.
The banks declined or did not respond to requests for comment.
Some European regulators have already started testing their banks for climate change risks. 
Reuters reported in May that Fed supervisors had begun privately pressing lenders for data and details on their efforts to assess the exposure of their loan books to climate change. 
Those discussions are being driven by Kevin Stiroh, who began leading the Fed's climate change supervisory work in February. They have intensified in recent months and started to focus on how a balance sheet scenario analysis might work, according to the executives. 
""Broadly speaking, regulators are moving forward with all due speed on this,"" said Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the Financial Services Forum, which represents big banks, adding a 2023 timeline ""is about right.""
Fed officials have not previously indicated when they would expect to perform an analysis. In an interview with Reuters, Randal Quarles, the Fed's outgoing vice chair for supervision, said that there was no official timeline, but he likewise told Reuters two years ""sounds about right.""
Unlike bank stress tests which allocate capital, the scenario analysis is expected to broadly function as a standalone data-gathering exercise and would not result in capital charges, said the executives and the Forum's Campbell.
Nevertheless, it would generate critical data that could pave the way for regulators to introduce capital penalties or other lending restrictions. 
In a recent interview with Reuters, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he believed climate scrutiny from the Fed was ""unavoidable"" and would eventually lead to additional capital requirements.
POLITICAL PRESSURE
Some congressional Democrats and progressive groups want the Fed to move faster and roll out an analysis as early as next year, and hope an impending reshuffle of the central bank's board may speed things up. 
""What they have now certainly would allow them to start running some level of scenarios both on physical and transition risks,"" said Phillip Basil, director of banking policy at progressive think tank Better Markets and a former Fed official. 
Republicans say the Fed should not drive climate policy and fear oil and gas companies could lose access to capital.
""They're super sensitive to the politics around this,"" said one of the industry executives referring to Fed officials. 
The Fed is an independent agency and chair Jerome Powell, who could soon be renominated to the role, has said the central bank's mandate is to focus only on risk-management issues.
""The Fed should pursue scenario analysis, and analysis of the effect of climate on the financial system generally and rigorously and analytically,"" Quarles told Reuters.
""There's a lot of work to be done in developing something like that."" 
DIMON SEES EVENTUAL CLIMATE CHARGE
Climate risk testing is highly complex and novel territory for the Fed which is looking closely at what its counterparts in Europe and elsewhere are doing , the people said. 
The Netherlands and France have put their banks through climate-change exams, and the Bank of England and European Central Bank plan to do the same in coming months.
Broadly speaking, those exams assess how bank balance sheets would fare under a range of economic scenarios which are modeled based on how aggressively policymakers act to curb temperature rises.
For example, the Bank of England's upcoming analysis includes two scenarios in which both early and rushed policy responses ultimately help cap average global temperature rises at 1.8 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and a third scenario in which inaction results in a 3.3 degrees Celsius increase. 
So far, no country has gone so far as to directly tie bank capital requirements to the results.
The Fed last year joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, an international group of regulators which has designed a range of scenarios the central bank could lean on.
Much of the supervisory discussions are focused on how banks can identify, analyze and model both financial and non-financial data. One executive said lenders are struggling with stale and retrospective weather data, and how to capture emissions related to clients' downstream suppliers, among other challenges. 
Fed governor Lael Brainard, who could potentially replace Powell or Quarles, in a speech last month acknowledged the data challenges, but said regulators have to start somewhere. 
It was unclear if the Fed would follow its overseas peers and publish the aggregate results from all the big banks, rather than from each institution, said several of the sources. 
Campbell said it was also unclear whether the Fed would give banks specific climate change scenarios similar to the economic scenarios it devises for annual bank stress tests, or just broad parameters. 
He added it was not a given the Fed would ultimately try to use a scenario analysis to allocate capital because such exercises try to gauge risks over a much longer time horizon and with far bigger assumptions than traditional bank stress tests.

Some bankers, though, disagree. 
""When they figure out what they really want to stress test and it's really real, they probably will appoint capital,"" said Dimon.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 08:20PM ET</span>",U.S.-China tech war clouds SK Hynix's plans for a key chip factory,"By Stephen Nellis, Joyce Lee and Toby Sterling
SEOUL (Reuters) -Plans by Korea's SK Hynix to overhaul a huge facility in China so it can make memory chips more efficiently are in jeopardy, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, because U.S. officials do not want advanced equipment used in the process to enter into China.
The potential setback could make SK Hynix, one of the world's biggest suppliers of DRAM memory chips that go into everything from smartphones to data centers, the next https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xilinx-results/huawei-exposure-roils-xilinxs-revenue-forecast-idUSKBN1X22KV victim https://www.reuters.com/article/micron-tech-results/micron-yet-to-regain-license-to-sell-to-huawei-pressuring-sales-idUSKBN26L07P of the geopolitical struggle between the United States and China.
SK Hynix production plans call for the company to upgrade a mass production facility in Wuxi, China, with some of the latest extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) chipmaking machines made by Dutch firm ASML, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
The United States in the past has objected on the grounds that shipping such advanced tools to China could be used to strengthen the country's military.
A senior White House official declined to comment specifically on the matter of whether U.S. officials would allow SK Hynix to bring EUV tools to China. But the official told Reuters the Biden administration remains focused on preventing China from using U.S. and allied technologies to develop state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing that would help China modernize its military.
The Wuxi factory is critical to the global electronics industry because it makes about half of SK Hynix's DRAM chips, which amounts to 15% of the global total. Any major changes could have an impact on global memory markets, where analyst firm IDC says demand is growing at 19% in 2021 alone.
As newer styles of chips make up a greater share of SK Hynix's production in two to three years, the company will need the EUV machines to control its costs and accelerate production, a source with knowledge of the company's operations in China said.
The extent of the concerns inside of SK Hynix have not been previously reported. If the situation is not resolved in the next several years, SK Hynix could stand at a disadvantage against rivals such as No. 1 memory chipmaker Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and the United States' Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), the other two major players in the DRAM market. Both Samsung (KS:005930) and Micron are also shifting to ASML's EUV machines but are not using them at factory locations where the machines face export restrictions.
The question of the ASML machines has drawn enough concern within SK Hynix that Chief Executive Lee Seok-hee raised the issue with U.S. officials during a visit to Washington, D.C. in July, according to two people briefed on his visit. 
SK Hynix declined to comment on the matter, adding that it operates flexibly according to various market environments and is doing its best to respond to market and customer demands without issue. 
The Trump administration successfully mounted an extensive campaign https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN to block the sale of ASML's technology to China's state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, lobbying the Netherlands government with White House officials sharing a classified intelligence report with the country's Prime Minister.
An ASML spokesperson said that the company abides by all export control laws and views them as a ""valid tool"" for governments to ensure national security. But the company said the overuse of those controls ""might impact the production capacity needed to stay ahead of the increasing demand of semiconductors.""
""It is likely that widespread use of export controls could exacerbate microchip supply chain issues, which are already a major concern of governments and policy makers around the world because of the spill-over effect to other industries"" such as the automotive industry, the spokesperson said in a statement.

Analysts do not believe that U.S. officials would view SK Hynix's efforts to bring an EUV tool into China any differently than earlier efforts by Chinese firms.
""They're really caught between a Chinese rock and a U.S. hard spot,"" said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSIresearch, who added that the rules would likely apply to any chip manufacturing operations in China, foreign or domestically controlled. ""Anyone who puts an EUV tool in China gives China the capacity. Once it's there, you have no idea where it will go after that. The Chinese could always seize it or do whatever they wanted to do.""

The developer agreed to sell its 18% holding in the internet services firm to Hong Kong-based Allied Resources Investment Holdings Ltd. at HK$1.28 apiece, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. That’s a discount of about 24% to the last close on Wednesday.
Evergrande said it expects to incur a loss of HK$8.5 billion from the sale, which comes as it tries to raise cash and make good on more than $300 billion in liabilities. The company is at the center of a debt crisis enveloping Chinese developers as they struggle with a leverage clampdown and a sales slump. 
Evergrande will use the proceeds of the sale for general working capital, it said. The buyer, Allied Resources, is controlled by Li Shao Yu. 
Shares of HengTen Networks have dropped 36% this year, while Evergrande has tumbled 81%.
Evergrande bought the Hong Kong-listed company with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. in 2015, renaming it HengTen as an internet firm focusing on the film business. Evergrande held a 55.6% stake in HengTen before October 2020, but it has been selling down its holding in recent months. 
Earlier this month, Evergrande offloaded a combined 530 million shares in HengTen through the open market for HK$1.12 billion, Bloomberg calculations show. In late June, it sold part of its stake to Ke Liming, owner of HengTen subsidiary Pumpkin Films Ltd. In August, it raised $418 million by selling another stake in the firm.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 07:50PM ET</span>","U.S. House, Senate will negotiate on China tech bill","By Patricia Zengerle and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House and Senate leaders said on Wednesday that lawmakers would negotiate to try to reach final agreement on a bill to boost U.S. technology competitiveness with China and semiconductor manufacturing. 
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had sought to attach the bill to a $750 billion annual defense policy proposal. He said on Monday he planned to add the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), hoping to get it passed so President Joe Biden can sign it into law this year.
USICA includes $52 billion to increase U.S. semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research to compete with China.
But the plan to combine USICA and the NDAA faced opposition, with Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying in a statement on Wednesday: ""Senate Republicans made it clear they would block the inclusion of USICA on the NDAA.""
The Senate passed USICA with bipartisan support in June. But the House of Representatives never took up the Senate-passed measure. House leaders said earlier they wanted to pass their own bill, but never did.
Schumer and Pelosi said they would now enter formal negotiations on USICA by going to ""conference.""
""Working with President Biden, the House and Senate have been crafting bipartisan legislation to bolster American manufacturing, fix our supply chains, and invest in the next generation of cutting-edge technology research,"" the two said, adding: ""There are still a number of important unresolved issues.""
Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell said the Senate got ahead of the House on USICA but that Congress must act quickly. ""America's R&D infrastructure needs to be dusted off,"" she told reporters.

Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said the combined NDAA and USICA would be worth more than $1 trillion in one year.
Too much of that, he argued, would go to high-profit defense contractors as well as to semiconductor firms that shifted manufacturing to China, taking away U.S. jobs and contributing to the current worldwide chip shortage.

(Reuters) -Cisco Systems Inc forecast current-quarter revenue below expectations as supply chain shortages and delays drive up costs. 
Shares of the network gear maker fell 6.3% in extended trading after it said it expects second-quarter revenue to grow 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year, compared with Wall Street expectations of about 7.4%. 
Businesses across the globe are facing an unprecedented semiconductor shortage that has pushed up expenses, hurting companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) that use chips in their products. 
Cisco Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren told Reuters the company also faces higher transport and logistics costs in its supply chain. Cisco is making progress on pinpointing and resolving component shortages but getting everything to the right place remains a challenge, he said. 
""A lot more of the subcomponents are coming via air than would have come traditionally,"" Herren said. ""The port snarls have hit us in a couple of places.""
Cisco is working to derive more of its sales from software but still gets most of its revenue from hardware. It expects to see the benefit from hardware price increases that came into effect on Sept. 1 later into its fiscal year, because it is still working through hardware backlogs.
The company said orders grew by 33% in the first quarter ended Oct. 30, suggesting strong demand, but supply issues prevented this from translating into revenue right away. 
However, the company stood by its fiscal 2022 overall growth target of between 5% and 7%, which was in line with analyst expectations of 6%, according to Refinitiv data. Herren said a $15.9 billion backlog of remaining contracts, 60% of which are for services and 40% of which are for software, provides some stability despite hardware supply chain issues.
""We know what that stream looks like through the end of the year,"" Herren said of the contracts.

The San Jose, California-based company said it expects second-quarter profit per share between 80 cents and 82 cents, with the midpoint narrowly missing Refinitiv IBES estimates of 82 cents.
Revenue for the quarter ended Oct. 30 was $12.90 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $12.98 billion, according to IBES data.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp forecast fourth-quarter revenue above analysts' expectations on Wednesday, betting on growth in its data center business as more internet companies set out to invest in artificial intelligence and the metaverse. 
The online realm that uses augmented and virtual reality to help users interact has captured more attention after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now renamed Meta, said it would boost capital expenditure and shift focus from its social media business. 
The move will be a big boost for Nvidia, the world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips, as metaverse applications would need more computing power and drive demand for chips. 
The company last month released Omniverse Enterprise, a set of software tools that will allow companies to collaborate in building virtual worlds, the computing power for which comes from Nvidia's chips.
Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said he believes Nvidia could eventually fetch up to $1,000 a year from up to 40 million virtual world creators and designers. The company believes about half its revenue from Omniverse will come from chips and half from software.
""There will probably be more virtual worlds than there are websites today. And the reason for that is they are easier to build,"" Huang told Reuters in an interview.
Nvidia expects current-quarter revenue of $7.40 billion, plus or minus 2%, above analysts' average estimate of $6.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company's shares were up nearly 4% in extended trading, after more than doubling this year.
The company has so far avoided major supply chain problems despite a global chip crunch, but supply chain costs are rising. It said Wednesday that outstanding inventory purchases and long-term supply obligations were $6.90 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year earlier. The company made a $1.6 billion payment in the third quarter alone to secure supply.
""When it came up, I jumped on the opportunity. Nvidia has a lot of cash, and we generate a lot of cash,"" Huang told Reuters. ""I was more than delighted to secure our future growth with cash.""
For the reported third quarter, revenue in Nvidia's gaming unit rose 42% to $3.22 billion and data centers surged 55% to $2.94 billion.

Analysts had expected $3.13 billion and $2.75 billion for gaming and data centers, respectively, according to FactSet. 
Overall, revenue rose about 50% to $7.10 billion for the three months ended Oct. 31, above the average estimate of $6.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Earnings were $1.17 per share on an adjusted basis, 6 cents more than expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street benchmarks ended Wednesday lower on inflation fears and supply chain concerns stemming from retailers' earnings, with investors betting the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates sooner than expected to tame rising prices.
 Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) was the latest big-name retailer to report positive results, upping its annual forecasts and beating profit expectations, citing an early start to holiday shopping.
But shares of the firm fell 4.7%, tracking declines in those of peer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) on Tuesday, as both retailers flagged a hit to their third-quarter margins from supply chain issues.
Other retailers yet to report earnings traded lower. Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohls Corp dropped 4.5% and 3.1% respectively, ahead of posting numbers on Thursday morning, and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN), on deck next week, slipped 5.2% and 4.2%.
Some retailers bucked the trend. TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX) gained 5.8%, its highest finish since Aug. 27, after the T.J. Maxx owner reported estimate-beating earnings, an increase in its share buyback program, and forecast it was well positioned to meet holiday-season demand.
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) Cos Inc rose 0.4% after the home improvement chain raised its full-year sales forecast on higher demand. Peer  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) had also reported strong results on Tuesday.
The Dow was also weighed by  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), which slumped 4.7% after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would stop accepting cards issued by the operator in the UK due to the high transaction fees.
While strong retail data this week showed a rise in inflation has not stifled economic growth so far, investors fear that further increases in prices could hurt growth and push the Federal Reserve into tightening policy ahead of schedule. 
""You've got inflation at a 31-year high, but we're at the lowest interest rates we've ever had, so those things just don't connect,"" said Salem Abraham, portfolio manager of the Abraham Fortress Fund.
He added while supply chain issues would ease as COVID moved to endemic status, the huge increase seen in money supply would ensure inflation would remain a serious problem for years.
Contrasting comments from Fed Presidents James Bullard and Mary Daly on Tuesday also brewed more uncertainty in markets. 
""The Fed will hold as long as they can ... But if (inflation) continues to go higher, and you continue to see inflationary pressure, then it becomes a question of how many and how often will (rates) rise,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
Strong retail earnings this week will round off an upbeat third-quarter earnings season, which had pushed Wall Street indexes to record highs.
Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp dropped 3.1% ahead of its earnings reported after the bell on Wednesday. The wider Philadelphia semiconductor index ended 0.7% lower after a record finish the previous day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 211.17 points, or 0.58%, to 35,931.05, the S&P 500 lost 12.23 points, or 0.26%, to 4,688.67 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 52.28 points, or 0.33%, to 15,921.57.
Electric vehicle makers were broadly positive. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Canoo both gained 3.3%, the latter after forecasting it would start U.S. production sooner than expected. Sono Group NV surged 155% on its Nasdaq debut.
But Rivian Automotive Inc tumbled 15.1% as investors locked in gains from a near 71% winning streak since the stock's listing last week.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.6 billion shares, compared with the 11.09 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 244 new lows.

The European Parliament's main political parties agreed to a deal that would apply to companies with a market capitalisation of at least 80 billion euros ($91 billion) and offering at least one internet service, such as an online search, the FT said, citing people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
The rules would draw more companies than previously thought into the EU's planned Digital Markets Act (DMA), the newspaper said, adding that the EU plans to implement the act next year. 
The DMA, proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last year, aims to curb the powers of big tech companies with a list of dos and don'ts.
The act will also help national competition authorities scrutinise tech companies' acquisitions of smaller rivals, amid fears of them acquiring competitors cheaply, according to the FT.
Companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google , Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) would fall under its scope, along with China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Netherlands' Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG), the newspaper said.
The U.S. government had raised concerns that the new rules would will come at the expense of U.S. companies, Reuters reported.

EU representatives last week agreed that the European Commission will be the sole enforcer of the new tech rules. 
EU ministers will formally ratify the agreement on Nov. 25, as part of the bloc's common position ahead of negotiations with EU lawmakers and the Commission on the draft rules known as the DMA before they can become law.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) warned the UK government on Wednesday that proposals set out by the European Union to ease the transit of goods to Northern Ireland risked increasing the administrative burden rather than reducing it.
In a letter to UK Brexit Minister David Frost seen by Reuters, M&S Chairman Archie Norman said the EU's proposals ""sound reasonable, but could result in worsening friction and cost and a high level of ambiguity and scope for dispute.""
Last month, the EU offered Britain a package of measures which stopped short of the overhaul that London is demanding. 
The EU's executive said the measures could halve customs paperwork and cut checks on meat, dairy and other food products coming to Northern Ireland from mainland Britain by 80%.
In return for concessions, the EU wants proper sharing of live data, reinforced monitoring of supply chains and labelling to ensure British products do not slip into the EU single market via a Northern Ireland back door.
Norman said the proposals could end up more costly to implement than full EU custom controls, with the relief offered in lighter touch border controls insufficient to offset the extra cost of labelling.
He said that labelling the circa 90 million products M&S sells annually in Northern Ireland would cost the retailer 9 million pounds ($12.1 million) a year.
Norman also noted that under the proposals a vet would need to oversee certification of 95% of product volume sent from the UK to Northern Ireland.
""This adds cost and a minimum of 4 hours per day into the supply chain which - with the other delays - means goods will take 1.8 days (45 hours) more to get to store than prior to the UK's departure from the European Union,"" he said, adding that the product range available for consumers would be impacted.
Norman said the best solution is for Britain and the EU to agree a time-limited equivalence arrangement.
Frost said on Wednesday Britain's preference is to strike a deal to improve post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland and that the agreement can be reached by Christmas.

Norman's letter to Frost was first reported by the Financial Times.

The 20-year agreement for the AEG-owned and operated venue, which is home to the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers, the NHL's LA Kings and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, will be effective from Christmas Day, AEG said.
The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, reported that the Singapore-based Crypto.com platform paid more than $700 million for the naming rights. Crypto.com was not immediately available for comment though it confirmed the deal in a statement on its website.
In over 20 years, the venue has been the stage for high-profile events like the Grammys and concerts by the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran.
Cryptocurrencies have attracted a surge of interest in recent months, as mainstream investors and companies embrace bitcoin and other digital token.
In a joint statement published on the Staples Center's website, the parties said that the deal would make Crypto.com an official cryptocurrency platform partner of the Los Angeles Lakers and the LA Kings.

Recently, soccer club Paris St Germain announced that Lionel Messi's signing fee at the club included some cryptocurrency fan tokens.
Crypto.com was founded in 2016. The actor Matt Damon is an investor in the platform and he recently took part in a campaign to promote it.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Vietnamese automaker VinFast plans to list on the U.S. stock market within the next couple of years, its chief executive told Reuters, joining a growing list of electric vehicle startups taking advantage of investor excitement to raise money.
VinFast, established in 2017 as part of Vingroup JSC, the largest conglomerate in the Communist-ruled country, also plans to start producing electric cars in the United States in the second half of 2024, global Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said in an interview on Wednesday.
""Of course we work through different options. But yes, we will also go after an IPO in the United States in the next one or two years,"" said the former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Opel executive who was named to his position at VinFast in July.
Lohscheller said the company, which has a car factory in Vietnam, sees U.S. production as ""an incredibly important strategic decision ... because shipping cars and cars around the world is not a long term setup.""
""We want to do everything locally,"" he said.

VinFast unveiled two electric sport utility vehicles, VF (NYSE:VFC) e35 and VF e36, at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday.
It will begin taking pre-orders in the U.S. market for the electric SUVs in spring 2022 and expects to begin delivering them in the fourth quarter of that year.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 06:35PM ET</span>","News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch takes swings at Google, Facebook","By Dawn Chmielewski and Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch renewed his attacks on Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) during News Corp’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, accusing the tech giants of trying to silence conservative voices and calling for ""significant reform.""
The Silicon Valley companies are favorite targets for Murdoch, 90, who for years has criticized Google for taking the publisher's news articles without compensation and Facebook with failing to adequately reward publishers. The public flogging continued, despite News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) winning concessions from both companies, which earlier this year agreed to pay for the publisher’s content in Australia.
""For many years our company has been leading the global debate about Big Digital,"" said Murdoch. ""What we have seen in the past few weeks about the practices at Facebook and Google surely reinforces the need for significant reform.""
Murdoch accused Facebook’s employees of trying to silence conservative voices, and noted ""a similar pattern of selectivity"" in Google’s search results. But according to data from Facebook-owned analytics firm CrowdTangle, posts from conservative personalities such as Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro routinely rank among the most popular on the platform.
Further, the media mogul cited a lawsuit, filed last year by 10 state attorneys general, accusing Google of monopolizing the digital ad market and allegedly working with Facebook to manipulate online auctions where advertisers buy and sell ad space. 
""Let us be very clear about the consequences of that digital ad market manipulation,"" said Murdoch. ""Obviously, publishers have been materially damaged, but companies have also been overcharged for their advertising, and consumers have thus paid too much for products.""
Representatives for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.
Murdoch called for algorithmic transparency -- echoing debate in Congress in the wake of Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s disclosures about the social network’s business practices. 
""The idea falsely promoted by the platforms that algorithms are somehow objective and solely scientific is complete nonsense,"" Murdoch asserted. ""Algorithms are subjective and they can be manipulated by people to kill competition, damage other people, publishers and businesses.""

Murdoch also called on former U.S. President Trump, who published an Oct. 27 letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal repeating the false claim that the 2021 presidential election was rigged, to move beyond the past in the service of American conservatives. 
""The past is the past and the country is now in a contest to define the future,"" Murdoch said.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google will begin paying Agence France-Presse for its news content as part of broad five-year partnership announced Wednesday that marks one of the biggest licensing deals struck by a tech giant under a new French law.
News organizations, which have been losing ad revenue to online aggregators such as Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have complained for years about the tech companies using stories in search results or other features without payment. 
New laws in France and Australia - fueled by media lobbying and public pressure - have given publishers greater leverage, leading to a slew of licensing deals around the world collectively worth billions of dollars.
The AFP accord follows France enacting a copyright law that creates “neighboring rights,” requiring big tech companies to open talks with news publishers that want a licensing payment.
Google declined to disclose financial terms of the deal, but confirmed it would run for five years. The companies said in a joint press release that they also will collaborate on projects, such as fact-checking. 
“This agreement is a recognition of the value of information,"" Fabrice Fries, Agence France-Presse's chief executive, said in a statement. 
Google earlier this year agreed to pay $76 million over three years to a group of 121 French news publishers, not including AFP, Reuters previously reported. But the deal has been on hold, pending the outcome of an antitrust proceeding in which France's competition regulator has accused Google of failing to negotiate in good faith.
Sébastien Missoffe, managing director of Google France, said the AFP deal showed the tech company's ""willingness to find common ground with publishers.""
The deal does not bring AFP into News Showcase, a feature that Google launched last year that promotes content from over 1,000 publishers that have agreed to license content for a fee.

Reuters signed a News Showcase agreement https://www.reuters.com/article/rpb-googlenewsshowcase/reuters-becomes-first-global-news-provider-to-offer-content-on-google-news-showcase-idINKBN29Q2SV with Google in January, and Wall Street Journal owner News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) closed a similar deal a month later.
Facebook last month signed a neighboring rights deal with a French alliance including dozens of publishers such as Le Figaro.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 06:27PM ET</span>","White House lauds easing of supply chain clogs, cites shipping competition concerns","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday lauded improvements in clogged U.S. supply chains, with more goods moving than ever before, but said more work was needed to ensure fair competition in a global shipping sector dominated by three alliances of ocean carriers.
In a new blog, the White House National Economic Council said the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC (NYSE:FMC)), an independent agency, was already investigating excessive shipping fees, but should consider using other tools, including challenging carrier alliances if they resulted in unreasonable costs or delays.
It also urged Congress to enact reforms to give the FMC more tools to oversee the global shipping sector, including boosting transparency about fees carriers charge their customers. 
President Joe Biden and his administration are racing to address supply chain snarls that emerged in the wake of stronger-than-expected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueling product shortages and inflation.
Much of the focus has been on U.S. ports, which have been inundated with cargo as a result of seismic shift in consumer spending during the pandemic, from travel and dining to physical goods.
The pandemic also reduced the number of workers needed to keep goods flowing smoothly. Aging truckers retired early, while infection control measures have limited dock and warehouse staffing.
The White House said new data showed continued improvements, with a record number of containers imported at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, from January to October, retail inventories up 4% from 2020, and on-the-shelf availability at 90%, just 1% below levels seen before the pandemic.
""The good news is that we're moving more goods than ever before, we're seeing that retail is fully stocked, and we're seeing that the ports are moving these goods more quickly,"" a senior White House official said. ""That means it's going to be a normal holiday season for Americans.""
At the same time, the White House said more work was needed to improve exports out of U.S. ports, with rising shipping costs making it more profitable for carriers to load empty containers instead of waiting for loaded containers to get to ports.
""The problem ... raises questions about the fair treatment of American exporters and importers in the shipping industry,"" it said, noting that nine carriers organized in three alliances now controlled 80% of global shipping, up from just 29% in 2011.

The alliances are legally immune from antitrust laws, but the FMC can challenge them if they result in unreasonable delays, unreasonable increase in transportation costs or ""substantially lessen competition,"" the White House said.
It said the U.S. Justice Department stood ready to help the FMC, adding that the agency needs a bigger budget than its current $30 million.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 06:27PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC allows investors to cherry-pick candidates in contested corporate elections,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday agreed to give investors who vote by proxy more freedom to choose their candidates during contested corporate board elections, as the agency's Democratic leadership seeks to bolster shareholder rights.
Until now, shareholders who voted remotely in contested elections had to choose from a full slate of board directors nominated by the management or a competing set of nominees provided by an activist investor. 
The five-commissioner panel voted 4-1 to adopt the new rule.
Unlike in countries such as Canada and Australia, investors in the United States could not mix and match from these competing lists unless they sent a representative to vote in person at the annual meeting. The vast majority of corporate votes are cast remotely.
In 2016, two weeks before the election of former President Donald Trump, the securities regulator proposed an Obama-era reform that would have given shareholders in companies more freedom to vote for their preferred candidates during contested board elections.
It was later shelved by the agency's then Republican leadership, which cited a preference to loosening rules that it said deterred firms from going public. 
Wednesday's rule requires ""universal"" proxy cards listing all duly nominated director candidates, effectively allowing shareholders to mix and match. 
Investor advocates say the former system allowed corporate management to skew elections by proposing ballots with limited candidates whom they prefer. Other candidates submitted by investors are often relegated to separate ballots.
Business groups approve the status quo, calling it efficient and warning that a universal proxy card could lead to over-voting, more frequent disqualification of defective ballots and even shareholder confusion.
The new rule will put investors voting in person on an equal footing with those voting by proxy, said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. 
""It makes sense that shareholders should be able to see all the candidates in one place, just as they would in person. This is an important aspect of shareholder democracy,"" he added.
Advocates welcomed the SEC's decision.
""This should be called the investor-choice rule,"" said Amy Borrus, who leads the Washington-based Council of Institutional Investors. ""This small but significant reform ensures that investors voting by proxy card - as the vast majority of institutional and individual investors do - can vote for whichever combination of director nominees they think best serves their interests.""
An influential proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), called the measure ""a significant milestone"" that ensures corporate elections are ""fair, transparent, and efficient.""
Elad Roisman, a Republican commissioner, voted in favor of the measure but said he would have preferred that the rule require those launching a proxy contest to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as thresholds of ownership in the target company or holding periods for the company's stock.
""Such criteria would demonstrate that a dissident has an economic stake or investment interest in the target company.""
ADDITIONAL PROXY ADVISER MEASURE
The U.S. markets regulator also voted to propose a measure that requires enhanced disclosure and voting options in all corporate director elections.
Subject to public consultation before it can be adopted, the proposal would rescind a Trump-era rule that sought to restrict proxy advisory firms, which recommend to investors how to vote and cast ballots on behalf of some asset managers.
This SEC proposal would undo, among other previous restrictions, a condition that required proxy advisory firms to make their advice available to companies that are the subject of their advice at or before the meeting.

On Wednesday, industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers said they were ""extremely concerned"" that the SEC proposed revisions to a 2020 proxy rule ""absent of any new information about its impact on the market.""
The powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticized the move as a sign the agency ""is not serious about rooting out and eliminating misinformation and conflicts of interest in the proxy process.""

In August the FTC refreshed its antitrust case against Facebook, now Meta Platforms, adding detail on the accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and asking a judge to force it to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.
The lawsuit represents one of the most significant challenges the FTC has brought against a tech company in decades, and is being closely watched as Washington aims to tackle Big Tech's extensive market power.
In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the FTC said that for more than a decade, Facebook's market share - for example, more than 70% of daily active users - exceed the levels needed to establish monopoly power.
It said that Facebook sought to maintain its monopoly position by buying photo-sharing app Instagram and secure messaging app WhatsApp.
Meta disagreed.
""The FTC has once again brought a monopolization case without a monopolist. Its claims ignore the reality that people have more choices than ever before in how they share, connect, and communicate, and its second complaint should be dismissed just like the first,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.

The FTC also argued that Facebook was wrong to ask that Chair Lina Khan be recused from voting to approve the amended complaint. The FTC said it was originally filed before she was nominated to the commission and it would be the court, not the commission, which decided the case.
Facebook had said that Khan prejudged the case because of her previous work.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc is considering dropping Visa (NYSE:V) as partner on its U.S. co-branded credit card after earlier confirming it would stop accepting Visa credit cards in the United Kingdom as a dispute over payments intensified.
The e-commerce giant is in talks with several payment networks including Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA),  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and Visa as part of what it called its standard process for reviewing its co-branded credit card agreement, a spokesperson said.
Visa declined to comment on the co-branded card. Mastercard and American Express did not respond to requests for comment.
Earlier, shares of Visa closed 4.7% lower after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would stop taking payments from Visa credit cards in the UK from Jan. 19, 2022. In a statement, it said such charges should be ""going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.""
In recent months, Amazon has introduced surcharges on customers using Visa credit cards in Singapore and Australia, citing high fees, as the relationship between the two firms deteriorated.
Since Britain's exit from the European Union, an EU-enforced cap on fees charged by card issuers is no longer in place in the UK, meaning providers are free to hike charges. 
Visa last month began charging 1.5% of the transaction value for credit card payments made online or over the phone between the UK and EU, and 1.15% for debit card transactions, up from 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.
The average credit card processing fees across the industry range between 1.5% and 3.5% of each transaction, according to analysts.
Historically, retailers had accepted processing charges by major credit card firms as the cost of access to their huge network of card users, analysts said, but that could be changing.
The move marks an ""important turning point in the payments industry,"" said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), adding Amazon may hope to drive more customers to its own payments system.
""Ultimately, we think Amazon has the edge in this game of chicken - whether customers adopt its own payment system or Visa gives in and lowers its fees, either is a win for the retail giant,"" Hoy said.
In the past, other big retailers have settled fee disputes with Visa after announcing they were going to quit taking Visa credit cards in narrow segments of their businesses.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's unit in Canada, for example, said in 2016 it would stop accepting Visa credit cards after being unable to reach an agreement on fees. Seven months later the companies said they had settled the matter after about 20 stores stopped taking Visa cards.
Amazon customers can still use Visa debit cards, Mastercard and Amex credit cards, and Eurocard, in the UK, Amazon said in a note to customers.
Visa said in a statement it was ""disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice.""
""We continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon UK without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022,"" Visa added. 

Shares of rival Mastercard dropped 2.8% on Wednesday. Amazon shares rose 0.2%. American Express shares closed 0.7% lower.
The British Retail Consortium said other retailers in the United Kingdom faced higher charges for cross-border payments, following Britain's departure from the European Union.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 05:46PM ET</span>","Citing high gas prices, Biden asks FTC to redouble probe of possible 'illegal conduct'","By Andrea Shalal and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday said there was mounting evidence of anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies that is keeping fuel prices elevated, asking the Federal Trade Commission to dig deeper into possible ""illegal conduct"" in the market.
The White House is pressing on several fronts to try to lower fuel costs, even as tight global oil supply drives gasoline and heating oil prices higher. Retail gasoline prices recently touched seven-year highs as consumer demand has recovered while oil supply remains below pre-pandemic peaks.
Biden in August asked the FTC to investigate possible illegal conduct causing the spike in gas prices, which are contributing to surging inflation. On Wednesday he told FTC Chair Lina Khan in a letter that further action was needed. 
""The Federal Trade Commission has authority to consider whether illegal conduct is costing families at the pump. I believe you should do so immediately,"" he wrote.
An FTC spokesperson said they were also concerned about the issues raised in the White House letter and that the consumer agency was looking into the situation, a spokesperson said.
Gas prices have continued to rise at the pump even though the price of unfinished gasoline has dropped over the last month, Biden said, noting that the two largest U.S. oil and gas companies were on track to nearly double their net income compared to 2019.
""I do not accept hard-working Americans paying more for gas because of anti-competitive or otherwise potentially illegal conduct,"" the president said in the letter to Khan. 
""I therefore ask that the Commission further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets, and that you bring all of the Commission's tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing.""
The two largest oil and gas companies in the U.S. by market capitalization, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), respectively, didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Biden's approval ratings have dropped to the lowest point of his presidency in recent months amid growing concerns about rising prices, although his top economic advisers still say the surge will be transitory and should ease next year.
Republicans are using concerns about inflation as a ""cudgel"" to pound the Biden administration, his press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.
The FTC could use its authority to launch an ""open study investigation"" to obtain data on how companies set gas prices, and study actual pricing at the pumps, the White House said.
Kevin Book, a managing director with Clearview Energy Partners, said price changes often take time to filter through to consumers. 
“There is an up-like-a-rocket, down-like-a-feather phenomenon that happens at the pump and it frustrates politicians,” he said. 
For example, unfinished gasoline futures prices fell by $1.18 a gallon between January and late March of last year during the first coronavirus pandemic outbreak, but retail prices only dipped by 45 cents before ebbing later. (For graphic see https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/GASPRICES/jnvwexkrovw)
The FTC has looked into this issue many times and often comes up empty, Book said, adding that there were simply too many actors in the retail gasoline market for them to collude.
The average retail gas price per gallon in the United States was $3.413 as of Wednesday, from $3.319 a month ago, according to the American Automobile Association. The current futures price for unfinished gasoline known as RBOB is trading at $2.317 a gallon, but was trading at $2.49 a gallon a month ago.
The price of crude oil accounts for half of the cost of retail gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Department, followed by local and state taxes, along with refining, transportation and distribution costs. 
Retail gasoline prices vary state-by-state, with prices around $3 in Oklahoma and as high as $4.69 a gallon in California, due to state excise taxes and other factors. The federal gas tax is 18 cents per gallon.

Biden said he appreciated that the FTC had directed Commission staff to strengthen oversight of mergers in the oil and gas sector that result in fewer consumer choices and potentially higher prices.
Reuters reported last month that U.S. antitrust regulators had extended the approval process for at least five oil and gas mergers and acquisitions in the last three months.

(Reuters) -A European Medicines Agency panel voted against approval of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, in another blow to prospects for a treatment already grappling with a slow rollout in the United States.
Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen, which announced the negative vote on Wednesday, fell $3.17, or 1.2%, to close at $258.38. The company's shares have dropped about 37% since Aduhelm was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early June.
The panel recommendation will be taken into consideration by the EMA, which is not bound to follow, but usually does. 
""Given the existing data and controversy attached to the drug, we see no reason why there would be a divergence (in EMA's decision),"" said Wedbush analyst Laura Chico. 
Loss of European sales would effectively wipe away 40% of potential future Aduhelm revenue, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.
Only one of Biogen's two pivotal trials showed that Aduhelm can slow the rate of cognitive decline for Alzheimer's patients and the FDA's decision to approve the drug was controversial.
Some members of an advisory panel to the U.S. regulator resigned in protest and several prominent treatment centers have publicly said they will not offer Aduhelm to patients. 
On Monday, Biogen said its research chief Alfred Sandrock, who led development of the Alzheimer's disease drug, was leaving the company after a 23-year stint, a move that analysts called abrupt.
Aduhelm, the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, has seen slow uptake in the United States as hospitals and health insurers await a decision on coverage by Medicare, the government health plan for people over age 65.
The EMA's advisory panel decides what the regulator's recommendation on treatments, vaccines or devices should be.

The panel, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, will take a final opinion on Biogen's Aduhelm at a December meeting, Biogen said. 
Once the EMA has endorsed or refused a product, the executive body of the European Union, the European Commission, makes the final and formal decision which typically matches what the EMA has said.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed for a second day on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk sold more of his shares, while other high-flying electric vehicle makers hit the brakes on a euphoric rally.
Luxury electric car maker Lucid Group Inc dropped more than 5%, while Rivian Automotive Inc tumbled 15%, down for the first time since its blockbuster market debut last week made the company the second-most-valuable U.S. automaker.
Lucid's market value eclipsed that of Ford on Tuesday after the company said it is confident of producing 20,000 of its upcoming Lucid Air sedans in 2022.
Analysts said Rivian's stunning show in its initial public offering lifted demand for other EV stocks. 
Tesla climbed 3.25% to $1,089.01, as investors took in stride Musk's sale of another $973 million in stock to pay taxes after exercising options.
Investors exchanged $33.8 billion worth of Tesla shares on Wednesday, more than any other company on Wall Street and more than double the turnover of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) , the second most traded company, according to Refinitiv.
Musk has sold a combined 8.2 million shares since Nov. 8, making up about half the 10% of his Tesla shares he pledged to sell earlier this month. Gross proceeds of his stock sales are about $8.8 billion. 
EV manufacturers could benefit from significant, new EV subsidies from governments, including U.S. President Joe Biden's ""Build Back Better"" spending plan which calls for expanded tax credits for individuals and businesses to buy electric vehicles.
Sono Group NV, which makes electric cars integrated with solar panels, surged 155% in its Nasdaq debut.
Canoo climbed 3.35% after the electric pickup truck maker said it would start U.S. production in the final quarter of 2022, after saying in June that production would begin in 2023.
""It feels to me almost like earlier in the year with the meme stock craze, where you're getting these names that are coming out and the retail loves them. And they've got a nice story behind them,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
Lucid, Tesla and Rivian were among the top-most discussed stocks on investor-focused website stocktwits.com, signaling interest from small-time investors.
Electric vehicle makers have also drawn huge interest from options traders.
Tesla, Lucid, Rivian and blank-check company Gores Guggenheim, which is in a deal to take Swedish electric-car maker Polestar public, were among the top 20 most actively traded names in the options market this week, according to Trade Alert data.

The recent surge in EV stocks has spooked short sellers betting the prices of those companies' shares would fall, leading many of the traders to close their bets to avoid greater losses, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.
""We've seen short covering in virtually all the EV stocks, Dusaniwsky said. ""Most EV short sellers are incurring mark-to-market losses for the year.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 04:52PM ET</span>","Stocks slide on rate hike fears, gold prices gain","By Herbert Lash and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European stocks notched record closing highs on Wednesday but Wall Street ended the day lower on worries that rising inflation could push the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected, an outlook that boosted gold.
All three major U.S. indices ended the day lower, as investors processed whether strong consumer activity in the face of rising inflation could spur the Fed to ease back on stimulus faster than once thought.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.58%, the S&P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.33%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 0.29%.
Soaring gasoline prices in Europe added to inflation fears, but strong earnings reports helped push Germany's DAX, the French CAC 40 and the pan-European STOXX 600 to fresh closing records.
The dollar eased from a fresh 16-month high, while the euro remained a little soft as investors weighed the odds of central bank tightening, which could slow growth, amid rising price pressures.
Concerns that the Fed may mishandle inflation are overblown as the U.S. central bank has clearly signaled how it will reduce its bond-buying without destabilizing the market, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at wealth manager The Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
""I simply do not believe the market ultimately expects a policy mistake that drives out some of the liquidity that has helped these markets,"" Bahnsen said.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.15% to 95.795.
The euro eased 0.05% to $1.1313, while the yen fell 0.62% to $114.1100.
Investors think higher inflation could encourage the Fed to accelerate the tapering of its asset purchase program. 
The Fed began phasing out its bond-buying this month and expects to end purchases altogether by mid-2022. 
Inflation worries pushed investors to safe-haven gold. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.9% at $1,870.20 an ounce.
$1 TRILLION INFLOWS 
Global equities have seen inflows of about $1 trillion in the past 51 weeks as positive news on coronavirus vaccines emerged, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note, adding this year has already seen four times the inflows of the previous best year.
Oil prices slumped after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency warned of impending oversupply and that rising COVID-19 cases in Europe increased the downside risks to demand recovery.
The two major crude benchmarks fell to their lowest closing levels since early October.
Brent crude fell $2.15 to settle at $80.28 a barrel. U.S. crude settled down $2.40 at $78.36 a barrel.

U.S. Treasuries rallied as a recent backup in yields reached levels that lured buyers back into the securities and after the Treasury sold 20-year bonds to tepid, but not terrible demand.
Benchmark 10-year yields reached 1.65%, the highest since Oct. 26, before retreating and falling back to 1.59%. They have increased from a low of 1.42% last week, before data showed that U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest gain in 31 years in October.

(Reuters) - Greek yogurt maker Chobani on Wednesday disclosed paperwork for its U.S. initial public offering (IPO), revealing a nearly 14% jump in nine-month net sales.
The New York-based firm did not reveal the terms of its offering, but Reuters had reported in July that an IPO could value the company at above $10 billion.
Chobani, which means shepherd in Turkish, makes yogurt, oatmilk, and dairy- and plant-based creamers and probiotic beverages.
It was founded in 2005 by Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant to the United States who bought an old yogurt plant after taking a small loan, according to its website. 
The first cup of Chobani Greek yogurt hit store shelves in 2007.
The company, which has factories in New York, Idaho and Australia, rejected a bid for a majority stake from beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc in 2016, arguing that it wanted to remain independent.
Chobani's peers have also been looking to go public, aiming to tap strong market demand that has helped companies raise unprecedented levels of capital through IPOs this year. 
Swedish vegan milk maker Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB raised $1.4 billion in its U.S. IPO in May, while Reuters reported in April that Impossible Foods Inc is preparing for a public listing which could value the plant-based burger maker at around $10 billion.

Chobani expects to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""CHO"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for the offering.

Investing.com – The dollar took a breather Wednesday from its recent melt-up, but will remain “buy on dips” story as traders position for a liftoff in rates as soon as mid-2022.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.11%, to 95.81.
“The last few day’s upmove points towards a little breather [in the dollar],” Commerzbank FX and EM analyst Antje Praefcke said in a note.
“However, that would probably be an opportunity for the dollar bulls to buy the dollar at lower levels again. For me too the dollar remains a buy on dips’ short-term.,” Praefcke added.
The bullish outlook on the greenback comes a week after a hotter-than expected inflation report, strengthen expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to hike rates sooner rather later.
“[T]he US inflation data for October surprised clearly on the upside last week …  this provided further limited support for the rate expectations,”{{0|Commerzbank said in a note.”
Fed speak has turned more hawkish in recent weeks, with St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, who tends to lean dovish, warning of the threat of elevated inflation persisting for longer than expected.
“If inflation just happens to go away, we’re in great shape for that. We’re set up for that,” Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday.  
“But if inflation doesn’t go away as quickly as many are currently anticipating, then it’s going to be up to the Committee to keep inflation under control going forward,” he added.
Still, the outlook on Fed monetary policy has been muddied somewhat amid speculation on whether President Joe Biden will give Fed Chairman Jerome Powell the nod to continue leading the U.S. central bank.

However,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) analysts expect the benchmarks to cool off late this year, rising by a modest 9% through year’s end 2022 due to decelerating economic growth and the cessation of fed monetary support. The equity benchmarks’ record rally amid expectations of tightening fed policy and inflation is raising concerns about market volatility. So, in this environment, we think it might be wise to bet on stocks that have gained momentum and have the potential to maintain it irrespective of market conditions.

Furthermore, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects the economic recovery to reaccelerate in the coming quarters, driving the unemployment rate back to a 50-year low by the end of next year.
Against this favorable backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally-strong stocks WM Technology, Inc. (MAPS) and Enthusiast Gaming Holdings Inc. (EGLX). Though these companies missed earnings estimates in their last reported quarter, they have the potential to soar in price this month and beyond. Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to rally more than 85% in the near term.

177,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>","Pfizer, EV Stocks, Oil Industry: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks dipped on Wednesday, giving back some gains after strong retail earnings and signs consumers continue to spend.
Some investors are worried the Federal Reserve will move more quickly to raise interest rates as consumer prices surged the most in 31 years in October from last year. Still, the Fed is moving to reduce its bond buying program later this year. The question about rates will be decided down the road.
One of the big influences on the Fed’s direction will be President Joe Biden’s choice of who will lead it when current Chair Jerome Powell’s term comes to an end in February. He could either re-nominate Powell, as many expect, or pick board governor Lael Brainard to succeed him, as others expect.
Biden has said his decision could come this week.
Credit card issuer Visa (NYSE:V) weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would stop accepting its cards issued in the U.K. because of fees.
Otherwise, this week’s strong retail earnings cap off a positive earnings season that helped lift stocks to repeated records in recent weeks. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Vaccine meeting
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) will be in the spotlight as regulators consider making its Covid-19 vaccine booster available to all adults. The Food and Drug Administration is sitting Thursday and vaccine experts at Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent committee meet Friday to discuss merits of the case and approve the company’s third jab for all those 18 years and older.
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) is also seeking emergency approval to have its vaccine booster available to all adults. Though boosters are available to all in some locations, regulators initially approved them for those 65 and older or those in at-risk jobs or environments.
2. Electric stocks
Shares of electric vehicle makers have been on a tear over the last week, with Lucid and Rivian being among the biggest gainers. Now it’s going in the other direction. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) stock fell 6% on Wednesday and  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) -- one of the biggest IPOs of the year last week. -- fell 17%.
Still, both stocks have gained so much they now have market values that rival the biggest automakers in the world. 
3. Gas price scrutiny
Oil refining companies are under scrutiny after the Biden administration asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether there is anti-competitive activity holding prices at the gas pump high. 
Biden’s letter follows his direction to the antitrust regulator a few months back, routed through the director of the National Economic Council, to go behind reasons for spiraling gas prices. In his latest directive, Biden said further action is needed since “prices at the pump have continued to rise, even as refined fuel costs go down and industry profits go up.""

Investing.com — PayPal shares fell 5% on Wednesday after Bernstein cut its rating and price target, saying the payments giant is at risk of being disrupted by an upstart.
In a note to investors on Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat downgraded  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares to market perform from outperform, setting a price target of $220, down from $260.
Rawat said change is hastening, and PayPal is now at risk of being disrupted by a disruptor itself. 
The analyst cited three main reasons for the downgrade. 
The first reason is the increasing aggregation of e-commerce within large platforms such as Amazon and Shopify. This is an issue for the company, with a significant share of PayPal's volumes coming from larger merchants.
Secondly, the analyst sees slowing share gains because of the growth of trends such as Buy Now Pay Later as well as Apple Pay, Shop Pay, and improving card-on-file/saved card experiences.
Finally, Rawat said there is a well-funded onslaught of rapid innovation from peers such as Stripe, Shopify, Klarna, Affirm, and SQ.
""While PayPal is actively investing and evolving, it simply has more turf to defend vs. peers in our view,"" the analyst explained. 
However, Rawat added that ""the super app rollout could also surprise positively on engagement & reducing churn,"" while the analyst believes the stock will still be affected by online buying activity during the holiday period.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will ""inevitably"" see the number of telecom operators fall from four to three, Orange's CFO said on Wednesday, adding that recent take-private deals by two of them, Iliad and Altice, could improve conditions for a merger. 
The French telecoms market has not yet fully recovered from a protracted price war started by Iliad's Free Mobile services in 2012, with cut-throat offers successively hitting the performance of all four operators, including  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom.
This has prompted industry leaders to pursue consolidation, but all attempts have so far failed. 
The exit of Iliad and Altice Europe from the stock market may facilitate deals, Orange finance chief Ramon Fernandez told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) TMT conference.

""For companies which are private now, it's probably easier to consider... strategic options, maybe consolidation in the French market,"" Fernandez said. 
""I'm not saying that we are now on the verge of seeing something happening in France. But when the time will come, and inevitably it will come, it will be easier for these players to engage into discussions,"" he added.

Deliveroo said in September it was working with British supermarket group Morrisons, one of its existing partners, to offer 1,500 to 2,000 SKUs (stock keeping units) from a site in London. 
Chief Executive Will Shu said on Wednesday Deliveroo Hop was achieving an average delivery time of 11 minutes.
""The early sort of numbers we've seen on retention and frequency, albeit given it's about two months, have been really encouraging, so we'll be exploring more and more partnerships with different grocers on this model,"" he told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Technology, Media and Telecoms conference.
The rapid grocery delivery sector has snowballed in major cities like London in the last 12 months, with companies such as Getir, Weezy and Gorillas battling to deliver orders.
Deliveroo started offering grocery delivery about three years ago, initially in partnership with retailer Co-op, using a model whereby the retailer picks and packs orders in their stores and Deliveroo's riders deliver them in 20-25 minutes.
It has since partnered with other major retailers, including Waitrose, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Aldi in Britain and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) in France, Italy and Belgium.

Shu, however, said the dark store model was compelling for a number of reasons including better inventory accuracy than a high street store and faster delivery.
""We've had almost no stock outs or substitutions, which I think was the critical thing,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders are piling into options trades on electric-vehicle makers, drawn by sharp swings in the shares of companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group.
On Wednesday, Tesla, Lucid and Rivian made up three of the six most actively traded options names, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
The heavy options volume comes on the heels of big gains for shares of many of these companies. Shares of Rivian, which has just started selling vehicles and has little revenue to report, are up about 80% since its initial public offering last week; Lucid has gained 20% this week. Blank check company Gores Guggenheim, which is in a deal to take Swedish electric-car maker Polestar public, is up 17% for the week.
Tesla shares were up Wednesday, while some other electric vehicle makers retreated.
""It's the theme of the week,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). ""It does seem like they might be caught up in the meme-stock type of frenzy.""
Lucid, Rivian and Gores Guggenheim were among the top 20 most actively traded names in the options market this week, according to Trade Alert data. 
A surge of trading in a stock's options can exacerbate volatility in the underlying shares. It wasn’t immediately clear, however, what impact they have had on shares of the electric vehicle makers, Frederick said. 
Sentiment in the electric-vehicle makers' options leaned toward bearish and defensive bets on Wednesday, according to Trade Alert data. 
Lucid puts that would guard against the shares dropping below $50 by Friday were among the most actively traded contracts on the company. 

Puts convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are often used to guard against a drop in share price.
With Rivian shares down 17.0% at $142.7 on Wednesday, Rivian puts at the $150, $140, $130 levels also traded in heavy volume.

The FDA has cleared booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are immunocompromised, those aged 65 and older and for individuals at high risk of severe disease or who are regularly exposed to the virus. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is seeking authorization for a 50-microgram booster dose, half the strength of its original vaccine given in two shots about four weeks apart.
The filing comes a week after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) applied for a similar clearance for the booster doses of the vaccine it has developed with German partner BioNTech.
A decision from the FDA on Pfizer is expected this week ahead of a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel meeting on Friday to discuss expanding the eligibility for booster doses of the vaccine.
Moderna's shares rose 5% to $246.16 in afternoon trading on the news. 
Experts believe booster doses are vital for reducing COVID-19 to an endemic level and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in August announced plans to roll out booster doses for all adults in September.

Last month, the European Union's drug regulator approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all age groups over 18, at least six months after the second dose. The company has also applied for booster approval in Japan.
However, regulators in several countries, including France, Canada, Finland and Sweden, have taken a more defensive stance on Moderna's vaccine over heart-related safety concerns affecting younger people.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. startup Fisker Inc unveiled electric sport utility vehicles on Wednesday and claimed they would have higher driving ranges than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Model Y vehicles.
With production of its Ocean electric SUVs planned for next November, Fisker is set to join peer Lucid Group Inc in challenging Tesla's lead in battery technology.
Automakers and battery manufacturers are racing to ramp up production and develop advanced electric-vehicle batteries - key components of EVs whose demand is expected grow in the coming years. 
Fisker said it has leveraged Chinese battery maker CATL's technology to achieve an estimated driving range of more than 350 miles per charge for its most expensive Ocean Extreme SUV, priced at $68,999, and 340 miles for its Ocean Ultra, which is priced at $49,999. 
In comparison, Tesla's Model Y Long Range has a driving range of 330 miles and is priced at $58,990.
Fisker's two higher-range Ocean models will use nickel-based battery chemistry, while its most affordable version will use cheaper iron-based chemistry. Fisker said the base Ocean Sport model will be priced at $37,499 and achieve a driving range of 250 miles per charge. 
California-based startup Lucid Group Inc, led by former Tesla engineer Peter Rawlinson, had started the delivery of Air luxury electric sedans last month with a Tesla-beating driving range.

The Los Angeles Auto Show kicked off on Wednesday, becoming the first major U.S. auto show since the pandemic crisis.
Fisker was launched by Henrik Fisker, a one-time Aston-Martin designer whose previous venture, Fisker Automotive, collapsed in 2013. Fisker also struggled with the recall of batteries made by its previously supplier, A123, which later filed for bankruptcy and was eventually acquired by China's Wanxiang Group.

United said it was adding about 700 domestic flights for Thanksgiving week, and would fly 87% of its 2019 domestic schedule in November.
Last week, the Biden administration lifted travel restrictions for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries including China, South Africa, Brazil and much of Europe.

Investing.com — Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) stock hit a new high Wednesday, rising 7% to $125.82, after comments from Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak.
The analyst reiterated an overweight rating and $88 price target on Roblox shares after attending the company's analyst day. 
Nowak outlined several takeaways from the event, including the company's early leadership in the metaverse ""continued innovation to capitalize on materially higher long-term monetization.""
Other key points that stood out to Nowak include a $24 billion+ opportunity in music, the company investing to capitalize on the $252 billion opportunity in education, the investment in developer tools, and the company's optimization efforts.
Roblox's management also commented that ""in the next 3-5 years, All Brands Will Have a Roblox Strategy,"" which the Morgan Stanley analyst said implies the company is looking at advertising agencies having Roblox teams as they usually have social teams.
""We remain bullish RBLX as our model is under review,"" concluded Nowak."

DTEK in a statement said it was the only company that had not been paid after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government moved to solve a debt crunch in the renewable energy sector. 
The government on Wednesday said it would review the activities of the state enterprise in charge of repaying the debts, called ""Guaranteed Buyer"", and would settle debts owed to companies after that. 
""Guaranteed Buyer faithfully fulfils and will continue to fulfil its obligations to producers of electricity from renewable sources and international investors in Ukraine,"" the government said in a statement. 
Ukraine has aggressively targeted growth in wind and solar power as a way of lessening its dependence on fossil fuels, in particular on Russian gas following Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014.
But as the country tumbled into recession last year during the pandemic, the government struggled to pay for the power produced by wind and solar firms, angering investors.
To tackle the situation, the state-run electricity grid operator Ukrenergo tapped the market with its debut 5-year Eurobond in November in a bid to raise funds to resolve the payments crisis.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development invested $75 million in the securities. 
DTEK Renewable said it was still owned 3 billion hryvnias ($113.6 million).

The ""artificial delay"" and other ""illegal actions of a number of officials"" had led to a drop below par in quotations of DTEK Renewables Eurobonds, the company said.
""DTEK is preparing for the legal protection of its rights and compensation for damage caused to the company and investors in international instances and national courts,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, seeking to improve transparency in the world's biggest bond market, has asked staff for new rules to ensure principal trading firms (PTFs) are properly registered as dealers.
Speaking at the New York Federal Reserve, Gary Gensler said the rules would likely mandate PTFs, also known as high-frequency trading firms, to report their trades to FINRA's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE).
The SEC, as the U.S. market's regulator, should require that such trading firms comply with capital and record-keeping rules and be subject to periodic exams much like equities and corporate bond markets, he said.
Regulators have long argued that high-frequency trading, a computerized strategy that can move billions of dollars in fractions of a second, carries risks in the U.S. government bond market that threaten the ability of the market to function, as well as the ability of investors to fairly value assets.
Critics say high-frequency trading can cause excessive price swings in the bond market, which has faced declines in liquidity.
""It's time for us to close the regulatory gap and ensure we have regulatory oversight over PTFs and others engaged in the regular business of buying and selling in this market,"" Gensler said.

Gensler said registering these trading platforms can help promote resiliency and greater access in the Treasury market.
Agency rules would also consider ""whether all members of any registered clearing agency in this market should be required to bring in both sides of all of their trades - cash and repurchase agreement; how we might enhance or strengthen the Commission's Covered Clearing Agency Rules; and whether we can enable broader access to clearing, possibly including through responsible use of sponsored and correspondence clearing.""

The troubled Italian carrier, which last month was replaced by state-owned ITA Airways, said groups interested in entering the data room for the auction needed to express interest by Dec. 10. 
Binding bids for the Millemiglia programme, which has a base price of 50.6 million euros ($57.22 million), are due by Dec. 13, Alitalia said.
Under the deal with the EU Commission over the creation of a new carrier, ITA Airways is not allowed to take part in the auction, but can clinch a partnership with the buyer of Millemiglia in a second phase. 
The programme has 6.2 million members and survived the end of Alitalia's operations last month as customers can continue to earn miles by using the services of Alitalia's commercial partners or by travelling with Air France, KLM and Middle East Airlines. They can spend points through the lastminute.com portal. 

Millemiglia has been managed since 2013 by a separate company called Alitalia Loyalty.

(Reuters) -Lowe's Cos Inc raised its full-year sales forecast on Wednesday as a decision to expedite product shipments helps the home improvement chain overcome widespread supply snarls and capitalize on an early start to holiday shopping by consumers.
The company's third-quarter earnings also trounced market expectations, riding on a surge in demand for tools and building materials from Americans investing in their properties during a pandemic housing boom. Its shares rose 2%. 
Consumers are scooping up holiday and winter products such as snow blowers earlier than in previous years, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) said, echoing comments made by big-box retailer  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) 
""With broader awareness of potential global supply chain disruptions, we are seeing many consumers looking to purchase products as soon as they are available in our stores,"" William Boltz, the company's vice president of merchandising, told analysts on a call.
Despite the costs of bringing holiday products into its stores and warehouses earlier than originally planned, Lowe's gross margins expanded to 33.1% in the quarter from 32.7%.
The fatter margins, fueled by a focus on selling big-ticket items and lower spending, contrasted with figures from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Target that have reeled under high supply chain costs. 
""With the market more focused on near-term gross margin trends than ever due to the supply chain issues, (Lowe's) beat handily on that line,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said. 

Lowe's earned a profit of $2.73 per share, beating estimates of $2.36 a share, according to Refinitiv data. 
The company said it expected 2021 sales of about $95 billion, compared with a previous forecast of about $92 billion.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) on Wednesday raised its sales forecast for the holiday season, boosted by early Christmas shopping by Americans, even as the retailer warned of higher costs, fueling concerns that its margins could come under more pressure.
Like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target also reported a drop in gross margins for the third quarter, as it incurred higher transportation and labor costs in order to keep its shelves stocked for the make-or-break holiday season. 
Target shares, which have risen about 50% this year, fell about 5% to $253.63.
Big retailers are pulling out all the stops for the busiest time of the year, including chartering container ships and ordering products well ahead of time.
Target said its inventory levels were up more than $2 billion from a year earlier ahead of the holiday rush, as it also prioritized product categories important for the holidays. 
""(We) took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position ... even though those actions involve some incremental cost,"" Chief Financial Officer Michael Fiddelke said, adding that some of those cost pressures were temporary.
Target has also been increasing benefits for it employees in a tight labor market, while maintaining lower prices at a time when inflation is at record levels, adding to costs.
""Gross margin pressure highlights the risk to Target and peers from global supply chain ... That risk appears likely to linger through holiday and into early 2022 if not beyond,"" Evercore's Greg Melich said.
Still, comparable sales soared 12.7% in the quarter ended Oct. 30, with almost all of that growth coming from stores. Store traffic also jumped nearly 13%.

Target also raised its expectations for holiday quarter same-store sales to a range of high single to low double digits.
""We stand ready for an exceptionally strong holiday season,"" CEO Brian Cornell said.

Tight supply led to high prices, and shares of energy stocks soared. With winter coming, this isn't expected to change, especially with natural gas stocks. That's why investors should consider stocks such as  Whiting Petroleum Corp . (NYSE:WLL),  PDC Energy , Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY).As people emerged from their homes as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic diminished, global economic activities surged. So did energy prices, particularly natural gas. This led to massive share gains for natural gas stocks. While prices have cooled a little over the past few weeks, they are starting to rebound again.
The upcoming winter season is partly driving this. Making matters worse is the prediction by experts that this winter will be colder than the past few. The colder it is, the higher demand for natural gas. This leads to higher prices and more gains for natural gas stock prices. Also driving up prices this year is tight supply. So, as it gets colder and people increase their heat, prices go up, and the supply lessens even further.
Yesterday's news that German regulators suspended certification proceedings for a natural gas pipeline from Russia will likely lead to less fuel this winter in Europe and higher natural gas prices. Considering all these factors, it's more likely that natural gas stocks have more room to run. That's why investors should consider adding Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL), PDC Energy, Inc. (PDCE), and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) to their portfolios.

And given the heightening competition, not all cannabis operators are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. So, we believe investors are better off avoiding cannabis stocks Curaleaf (CURLF) and Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), which missed their sales estimates recently. So, let’s examine these names.The cannabis industry is attracting significant investor attention on hopes surrounding a GOP-led effort to legalize marijuana at the federal level. However, the health risks associated with cannabis use in adolescents raise questions about marijuana consumption. Furthermore, the FDA has approved only four cannabis drug products to date. There is no cannabis-based animal or food product that the FDA has approved. Also, there are numerous hemp-derived CBD products on the market that are not approved by the FDA for human or veterinary use.
Several challenges, including restricted access to capital and a federal criminal statute surrounding cannabis' production and distribution, could impede the industry’s growth. On the other hand, with cannabis industry laws becoming gradually more accommodating, more players are entering this space, making the industry highly competitive. So, not all cannabis operators are well-positioned to withstand the challenges and survive in a heavily competitive market.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CURLF) and Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB). These companies have also missed sales estimates in their recently released results.

Let’s discuss.The applications of semiconductor chips, which contain millions and sometimes billions of transistors, are increasing rapidly across several industries, including consumer electronics, automobiles, manufacturing, and medical equipment. Unfortunately, this increasing demand, faced with a pandemic-led slowdown in production, has spelled a shortage of semiconductor chips worldwide.
However, according to an International Data Corporation (IDC) report, the chip shortage is expected to normalize by the middle of 2022. Furthermore, according to the report, the semiconductor market is expected to reach $600 billion by 2025, growing at a 5.3% CAGR, compared to the 3% - 4% growth seen historically.

Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
The magazine said Merz's plan is to give away all the shares except for a minimum shareholding to existing shareholders, with the conglomerate giving the division financing that is below its estimated pension burden of 3.5 billion euros ($3.95 billion).
That could fuel a conflict with the IG Metall trade union and the works council, the magazine said.
In March, Merz said the steel unit must cut costs to reach a point where it no longer needs financial support from the group.

Thyssenkrupp in February terminated sale talks for the unit and said it will now develop the business on its own, which could result in a listing or a partnership.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 11:17AM ET</span>","Total global debt dips, but emerging market debt hits record high","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global debt dipped in the third quarter though it remained near the record high set in June, while debt in emerging markets hit a fresh record high of $92.5 trillion, a report showed on Wednesday.
Total debt, including that owed by governments, households and companies, dipped to $296 trillion at the end of September, after an increase to record highs in the second quarter. It stands about $36 trillion above pre-pandemic levels.
The ratio of debt to annual global economic output fell more than 10 percentage points from July through September, hitting 350% at the end of the third quarter, as economies across the globe recover from the pandemic-induced slow downs, data from the Institute of International Finance showed.
Total emerging market debt edged up to $92.6 trillion, with China taking the dragon's share.
Debt to GDP in China has risen 25 percentage points since the end of 2019 to 330%, accounting for more than 80% of emerging market debt buildup over the period. Emerging market government debt remained at about 63% of GDP, a record level.
In emerging markets excluding China, total debt hit a record high of $36.4 trillion, largely driven by increasing government debt, but external debt is on track to drop below 43% of GDP in 2021 from an all-time high of near 46% in 2020.
""With political and social pressure limiting governments' efforts to reduce deficits, high government financing needs represent a source of vulnerability in many countries in the face of broader revenue weakness,"" the IIF report said.
More than 95% of the increase in emerging market debt since the end of 2019 has been in local currency bonds, according to the data, though the appeal of that debt has fallen among foreign investors, who now hold around 19% of local currency debt compared to 23% at the end of 2019.
Indonesia and Russia saw the sharpest drop in foreign ownership, while demand increased in China, Peru and Korea.
In foreign exchange debt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Colombia have seen the sharpest increases in relation to GDP since the start of the pandemic.
In developed markets, debt declined by $1.4 trillion last quarter, the IIF said, with the sharpest declines in Japan and the euro area.

A large part of spending in developed markets went to social net and health, while still only a very small part is destined to environmental protection and climate change.
""With decarbonization efforts on the rise, many governments are expected to channel significantly more resources towards climate priorities, with major implications for government debt (and) interest rates,"" said the IIF.

The outlook comes as the airline continues to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions, operating at only 10% of the pre-pandemic passenger capacity in October and posting a 97.2% decline in passenger numbers from 2019.
""October was more challenging for our passenger business than recent months. Demand for student travel, which had been robust over the past few months, tapered down quickly from early-October,"" Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement. 
However, a strong cargo season in the second-half provided a bright spot, Cathay said, to the extent that the airline achieved close to operating cash break-even for the four-month period from July to October.
Reopening of Australian borders for vaccinated citizens also aided the recovery, Cathay said. 
""We have already added more capacity and seen an increase in flight bookings,"" the company said while referring to Australia.

The airline, which had posted https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/cathay-pacific-posts-narrower-h1-loss-costs-fall-2021-08-11 a net loss of HK$7.57 billion ($972.01 million) in the first half, still expects annual loss for 2021 to be substantial.

The club, owned by the American Glazer family, on Wednesday posted a loss of 15.5 million pounds ($20.85 million) for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 30.3 million pounds in the same period a year ago when COVID-19 disrupted sporting calendars and shuttered stadiums.
With the stadium, commonly known as the Theatre of Dreams, now able to welcome back tens of thousands of fans, matchday revenues jumped to 18.8 million pounds compared with 1.7 million pounds a year ago. Total revenue rose 16% to 126.5 million pounds.
The 20-time domestic champions have made a patchy start to the Premier League season, losing four of their first 11 matches to rank sixth in the standings. 
""While these financial results today demonstrate our resilience through the pandemic, our top priority is success on the pitch,"" Vice Chairman Ed  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) said in a statement.
Woodward is due to part ways with the club by the end of the year after attracting criticism for its involvement in the breakaway European Super League project. United has not yet named a replacement for the 49-year-old but reports suggest insider Richard Arnold is among the top runners.
United, which signed five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo from Italy's Juventus in August, and also recruited world cup winner Raphael Varane and England winger Jadon Sancho over the summer, said employee benefit expenses rose 23% to 88.5 million pounds.

Revenues from product sales jumped 21%, boosted by its new player signings and more home games being played, it said.

Investing.com – Shares of refiners trended lower Wednesday after President Joe Biden ordered Federal Trade Commission to redouble probe of energy companies for possible anti-competitive or ""illegal conduct"" in the market.
Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and Valero (NYSE:VLO) fell around 1%. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) rose 0.2%. Shares of integrated energy companies like  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) pared gains to trade almost flat. ADRs of Shell (NYSE:RDSa) were flat, too. Integrated energy companies have both upstream operations like exploration and production as well as downstream functions like refining and marketing of crude derivatives and thus better positioned to withstand regulatory action. 
Biden’s letter follows his direction to the antitrust regulator a few months back, routed through the director of the National Economic Council, to go behind reasons for spiraling gas prices. In his latest directive, Biden said further action is needed since “prices at the pump have continued to rise, even as refined fuel costs go down and industry profits go up.""
The president pointed out that there is an “unexplained large gap between the price of unfinished gasoline and the average price at the pump.”
""I therefore ask that the Commission further examine what is happening with oil and gas markets, and that you bring all of the Commission's tools to bear if you uncover any wrongdoing,"" the letter said."

BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) -A decision on a possible partnership between Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Audi and British sportscar maker McLaren was discussed at Audi's supervisory board meeting on Wednesday but will likely take until next year, two sources told Reuters.
Volkswagen, which owns Audi, discussed whether to get a foot into the Formula One market at a meeting last week, two sources who declined to be named told Reuters on Wednesday.
Its ultimate decision will rest on whether Formula 1 follows through on its plans to switch to synthetic fuels by 2026, a source told Reuters, and on McLaren's progress regarding electrification of its vehicles.
Volkswagen has invested the most of any global carmaker by far in electric vehicle production and batteries in an attempt to clean up its image from the Dieselgate emissions scandal and remain in line with governmental carbon reduction targets.
Audi declined to comment on a specific partnership with McLaren, but said it was ""consistently exploring different cooperation ideas"". 
McLaren did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The British sportscar maker told Reuters in February it was looking to generate revenue by selling some of its new technology to other automakers, including a new in-house produced carbon chassis to reduce the vehicle's weight.

Red Bull has worked with the Volkswagen Group in the past, notably in the world rally championship before the German manufacturer withdrew, and there has long been talk of a partnership with Audi or Porsche in Formula One.
McLaren would put a second supercar on Audi's books alongside Lamborghini, which it has controlled since 1998.

(Reuters) -Nescafe maker Nestle on Wednesday said it expects to nearly double its e-commerce sales to 25% of its group total by 2025 by stepping up marketing and technological investments.
Nestle will push sales of its products to consumers directly via its own online channels, or direct to consumer, Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said, building on the success of Nespresso coffee pods and Purina PetCare, which are increasingly being sold directly to consumers via Nespresso.com and Purina.co.uk. 
""We plan to take (e-commerce) sales from about 13% in 2020 to 25% by 2025,"" Bernard Meunier, head of Nestle's strategic business units and marketing and sales, said at a virtual investor summit. 
This will be achieved by increasing digital marketing investment to 70% by 2025 from 47% in 2020, Meunier added. 
The KitKat chocolate maker did not provide details of the size of the investment, which will be funded through self financing and savings. So far, Nestle's e-commerce investments have not been dilutive to the business, the company said.
Nestle's total sales in 2020 were 84.34 billion Swiss francs ($90.71 billion). E-commerce sales represented 14.1% of the total in the first nine months of 2021, compared with 12.8% in the same period in 2020.
Meunier said e-commerce sales growth will be driven by markets such as the United States, Europe and China.
Big food manufacturers are seeking to sell more of their products to consumers directly partly to gather data on shopping habits. Also, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google are taking steps to prevent advertisers from tracking user data without their consent, forcing companies to seek new avenues.
Nestle said its investment would generate 400 million first-party data points - information collected directly from consumers - that will feed into an analytics system to predict out-of-stocks and where sales can be boosted. The company currently collects about 205 million data points. 
The digital marketing investments will also be used to add more employees and expand the company's in-house studios for advertising instead of relying on digital agencies. 

""In a world where there is no rule book to follow, a lot of learning has been done already and we are looking forward to the next phase,"" Schneider said.

As the world’s demand for consumer electronics and automobiles increases, the demand for semiconductors is also expected to continue growing. According to a report by PWC, the market for AI-related semiconductors is expected to grow from a current $6 billion to more than $30 billion by 2022.

The protein-based vaccine, branded Nuvaxovid, has been under a rolling review since February, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. Such reviews allow for a speedy approval.
If approved by the EMA, the shot would be the region's fifth coronavirus vaccine, joining those from Pfizer-BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). 
The major approval could come much ahead of authorisation in the United States, where Novavax had to resolve manufacturing issues and expects to file for approval by the end of the year.

(Reuters) -TJX Cos Inc said it was well-positioned for the holiday season, easing concerns of product availability due to supply-chain bottlenecks and sending shares of the discount store operator up to a record high on Wednesday. 
Business at discount stores has picked up this year after coronavirus restrictions were eased, as people returning to work and colleges splurged on refreshing their wardrobes.
Shares rose more than 9% to touch an all-time high of $76.94 after the T.J. Maxx owner reported quarterly sales that beat estimates and raised its share buyback plan.
""We are in an excellent inventory position, with most of the product needed for the holiday season either on hand or scheduled to arrive at our stores and online in time for the holidays,"" Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said.
Industry-wide supply-chain bottlenecks raised worries that shelves of off-price outlets, including TJX (NYSE:TJX) and its rivals Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) and Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), might be left without major holiday goods.
However, the HomeGoods parent said inventories as of Oct. 30 were at $6.6 billion, compared with $6.3 billion at the end of the third quarter two years ago.
""This should alleviate investor concerns regarding TJX's ability to secure inventory across categories and drive healthy sales gains,"" Roxanne Meyer, an analyst at MKM Partners, said in a note.
TJX said overall open-only comparable store sales growth for the start of the fourth quarter were up in the mid-teens percentage range over the fourth quarter two years ago.
Net sales rose 24% to $12.53 billion in the third quarter, beating estimates of $12.27 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Net income gained 18% at $1.02 billion, or 84 cents per share. Analysts had expected 81 cents.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 09:57AM ET</span>","With limited EV options, Uber embraces carbon offsets in Latin America","(Clarifies increase in paragraph 13 is one percentage point)
By Cassandra Garrison
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Uber has set out to be carbon neutral by 2040, but the ride hailing company has picked a route in parts of Latin America that is fraught with challenges.
Since February, the U.S. group has offered customers in Mexico an ""Uber (NYSE:UBER) Planet"" option. For an additional 0.37 Mexican pesos per kilometer, they can contribute towards the purchase of carbon credits for reforestation projects and a wind farm in Oaxaca to offset the emissions caused by their rides. 
Carbon offsets are controversial https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1455904676227002375. When countries and companies find it difficult or expensive to cut greenhouse gas emissions, they sometimes use offsets to meet climate goals. These allow buyers to keep polluting while paying someone else to take climate friendly action. 
Uber's own climate report last year said the company avoided buying offsets as a primary strategy, instead emphasizing subsidies for its drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs). Offsets ""effectively pay to make it someone else's responsibility"" and have ""weaknesses,"" including verification challenges, Uber's report said.
    In parts of Latin America, however, the company told Reuters a transition for drivers to zero emission EVs was ""impractical"" in the near term, given nascent EV markets there. 
So in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Costa Rica it is using the Uber Planet offset scheme, alongside efforts to encourage drivers to switch to EVs, it said.
The decision underscores the difficulties transport companies face as they try to reduce their carbon footprints in emerging markets with relatively few sustainable alternatives. 
According to data analytics firm J.D. Power, electric and hybrid vehicles comprise just 6.4% of Mexico's car market, compared with 15% worldwide. By 2030, the market share is seen hitting 12% in Mexico, far behind the 50.5% predicted globally. 
MAKING A DIFFERENCE? 
Uber Planet buys credits in projects that have been certified by organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), a not-for-profit registry. 
Certification is supposed to confirm projects would not otherwise exist without the sale of carbon credits, giving assurance they are genuinely creating offsets. 
But one Mexican scheme supported by Uber, the Oaxaca IV wind farm project, may have gone ahead without the credits, according to Gilles Dufrasne, a policy officer at not-for-profit industry monitor Carbon Market Watch.
The certification documents for the project from 2011, reviewed by Reuters, showed carbon credits would provide about a one percentage point increase in its internal rate of return.
The farm's developers said in the documents, filed to the UNFCCC, that carbon credits were vital to secure financing. 
But Dufrasne said the modest benefit raised questions whether they were needed.
""The whole point of selling carbon credits is to have some way of measuring extra (emissions) reductions which would not have happened without the sale of the credits,"" he said. ""But if they were going to build the project anyway, then what you're paying now is just not making any difference.""
Danny Cullenward, an offset specialist at CarbonPlan, a not-for-profit research group who reviewed the project documents too, also questioned whether the sale of credits was necessary to secure financing, noting the wind farm had a deal for the government to buy its output at a guaranteed price.
""This isn't some business venture that's kind of risky and needs a little boost to stay afloat,"" said Cullenward. ""It's an infrastructure project with commercial mature technology that had a fixed price contract with the Mexican government.""
A spokesperson for Spain's Acciona, the parent company of Oaxaca IV, said the project was vetted under the UNFCCC's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
""The very fact that the U.N. included the Oaxaca IV project under the CDM mechanism is in itself proof of the contribution of the wind farm to the U.N.'s sustainable development goals,"" the spokesperson said.
The UNFCCC did not respond to requests for comment. 
The wind project accounts for about 16% of Uber Planet's carbon credit purchases in Mexico, according to data on Uber's local website. Of the 8,668 credits it bought from Honduras-based carbon credit broker Anaconda Carbon between February and August, almost 1,400 were from the project. 
Uber referred questions about the project to Anaconda. 
Anaconda President Christian Giles told Reuters the wind farm was properly validated and revenue from carbon credits was vital to it. 
""That argument was audited, not only by a third independent party, but also by the U.N. itself,"" he said, referring to the UNFCCC. 
'DOUBLE THE TIME'
Companies are under pressure from activists, investors, politicians and even each other to cut emissions. 
In Mexico City, Uber faces new competitors like Beat Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), with an all-electric fleet of Teslas. China's Didi Global, meanwhile, says it has 1,600 hybrid or electric vehicles in Mexico.
Uber says it is determined to cut emissions. 
""Every market where Uber is available will be taking bold steps to develop locally relevant strategies that move in parallel with our commitments. At this moment, we are presenting Uber Planet, understanding the urgency needed to crack down on this challenge immediately,"" said David Mínguez, an Uber spokesperson in Mexico. 
He said the company would take steps ""within the coming months"" to encourage more drivers to switch to electric or hybrid cars, including promotional prices for the vehicles and incentives like an extra 10,000 pesos per 160 trips. 
He predicted more than 600 of its drivers in Mexico would be able to change to an electric or hybrid vehicle in 2022. Uber has around 200,000 drivers and delivery partners in the country.
The high price of EVs puts them out of reach for most Mexicans, whose average daily salary is less than $21, while the country lacks the tax incentives and charging infrastructure to encourage drivers to switch. 

""We are going to move to that but it's going to take more than double the time it will happen for all other parts of the world,"" predicted Gerardo Gomez, director and country manager for J.D. Power in Mexico.

Enforcement activity tends to fall the year a new chair takes the helm at the agency. SEC chair Gary Gensler, known for being tough on Wall Street, joined the agency in mid-April.
While there are signs the agency is taking an increasingly aggressive posture with Wall Street and corporate America, the SEC's enforcement director earlier this month warned the agency's fiscal 2021 numbers would show a decline in enforcement activity.

Monetary settlements imposed in public company or subsidiary actions totaled $1.8 billion, with $835 million from disgorgement and interest, Wednesday's report showed.
For the first time in a decade, there were no public company or subsidiary defendants who admitted guilt, the report showed, something SEC officials have signaled in recent weeks will become more of a priority.

Investing.com – Cassava stock (NASDAQ:SAVA) plunged 20% Wednesday on reports the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating claims that the company manipulated research results of simufilam, its experimental drug for Alzheimer’s.
The company disclosed Monday in an SEC filing it is cooperating with government investigations. It said an investigation isn’t a sign any wrongdoing occurred. It did not the name any agency probing it.
The National Institutes of Health, which awarded $20 million in grants to Cassava and its academic collaborators since 2015 for drug development, is also examining the claims, The Wall Street Journal said, quoting the company’s chief executive officer.
The accusations surfaced in August when two physicians petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to order suspension of Cassava’s clinical trials.
Disputing the validity of Cassava’s clinical biomarker data and the integrity of Western Blot Analysis, the petition’s authors said they doubted the company’s research claiming it included images that appeared manipulated.
Cassava said the biomarker data of Alzheimer’s patients was generated by  Quanterix  (NASDAQ:QTRX), an independent company, and presented at the recent Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.
The company said Western Blot Analysis is foundational to the biotechnology industry and is a standard lab technique used worldwide to detect a protein of interest.
Cassava’s proposed drug for Alzheimer’s aims to restore a protein, filamin A, that its scientists say is misshaped in the blood of patients suffering from the fatal illness.
Earlier this month, the Journal of Neuroscience said it had found no evidence of data manipulation in an article it published in July 2012 describing a new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease.
Cassava’s lead drug candidate for treating Alzheimer’s is currently in a phase-3 clinical program."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday, retracing Tuesday's modest gains after another mixed batch of results from the retail sector, in which fears of rising cost pressures overshadowed overall decent operating figures for the quarter just ended. 
The market was also held back by a second straight decline in monthly housing starts, defying expectations for a rebound in October. Building permits, however, rebounded more sharply than expected.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 42 points, or 0.1% at 36,100 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down less than 0.1%.
Early attention was focused on retailers, after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) admitted on Tuesday that rising costs were starting to eat into its profits, and the same message was sent by its rival  Target , which said gross margins were compressed in the last three months. Target (NYSE:TGT) stock fell 5.2%. 
There were more upbeat updates, however, from Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), which was supported by the same factors as  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) had been on Tuesday - above all by buoyant demand from professionals for tools and building materials to service the boom in home improvement.  TJX (NYSE:TJX) stock also rose 8.2% after the discount fashion retailer reported a 14% rise in same-store sales in the quarter and reassured that its inventory was in good shape to meet peak holiday season demand. 
The bigger news in retail was, however, of a more long-term nature. Visa (NYSE:V) stock fell 4.8% after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it will no longer accept Visa cards issued in the U.K., in response to the latter's fee increase that kicked in at the start of October. While the U.K. accounts for a relatively small part of Visa's global business, the news sent a signal that the market power of established card providers is waning, as alternative payment solutions become broaden their presence. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock fell 4.4% in sympathy.
Elsewhere, the froth came off Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock after it more than doubled in its first week of trading to become the world's third-most valuable automotive group - without having ever sold a vehicle. The electric truck maker fell 15% in early dealings, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock put the recent block sales by CEO Elon Musk behind it, rising 3.1%.

(Reuters) -Baidu Inc beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates on the strength of its cloud business, but warned that China's regulatory crackdown and the pandemic would weigh on advertising sales in the coming quarters.
Beijing's wide-ranging crackdown has forced some of its largest companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent to change what were previously considered regular market practices. The crackdown has also dented advertising spending.
""Our ad spend has been impacted by sectors like education, real estate and home furnishing, travel and franchising as we expect this headwind to continue in the near term,"" said Chief Executive Robin Li on a conference call.
Earlier this month, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) warned the outlook for the advertising sector would remain weak into next year.
""The slowing down ad revenue growth was mainly on the macro headwinds, plus some regulation impacts on few verticals,"" Connie Gu, analyst at BOCOM International Securities said.
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) also said it expected to see its businesses like e-commerce benefit from the gradual opening up of the country's tech platforms to each other though it said it was not immediately able to quantify the impact.
The company, China's closest equivalent to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has forayed into AI, cloud and autonomous driving to supplement its core search business that has been pressured by competition.
Baidu's largest segment, online marketing, rose 6% in the reported quarter. However, the growth rate has been slowing in the last two quarters.
Baidu, which forecast current-quarter revenue in line with estimates, reported third-quarter revenue of 31.92 billion yuan ($5.00 billion) versus estimates of 31.71 billion yuan. On an adjusted basis, Baidu earned 14.66 yuan per ADS, compared to 12.81 yuan per ADS estimates.

The bank's pre-tax profit hit 35.8 billion Kenyan shillings ($320 million) from 17.14 billion shillings in the same period of last year. It did not provide a quarterly breakdown.

The bank, which also operates in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Burundi, said loan loss provisions fell to 9.3 billion shillings compared to 20.0 billion shillings last year. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) decreased from 15.1% to 13.7%, the bank said.
Net interest income was 56.4 billion shillings, compared to 47.9 billion in 2020.

In August, KCB posted a 70% year-on-year surge in first-half pre-tax profit, saying the worst of the pandemic was behind it although the recovery was not ""perfect"", and that the firm planned to normalise loan repayments by the end of next year.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 09:32AM ET</span>",Retooling auto plants for EVs will cost billions. Biden wants to help,"By Joseph White and David Shepardson
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co's ""Factory Zero"" in Detroit is on the front line of a battle for the U.S. electric vehicle market between ageing, unionized factories, and new, non-union plants run by young electric vehicle companies.
President Joe Biden's administration wants to give the older part of the American auto industry a boost. 
Biden's scheduled visit Wednesday to Factory Zero will put a spotlight on his administration's proposals to bring billions in federal aid to help older auto factories and the Midwestern communities that depend on them, as part of his ""Build Back Better"" spending bill.
The Biden administration and fellow Democrats in Congress have proposed nearly $50 billion in tax breaks, incentives for government agencies to buy electric vehicles, loans for retooling factories and aid to automotive plant communities. 
That doesn't count billions in new subsidies to spur sales of electric vehicles, such as a 30% tax credit for commercial electric vehicles.
A proposal for up to $12,500 in tax credits to consumers who buy an electric vehicle assembled in the United States by union workers so far appears to lack the votes to pass the closely divided U.S. Senate.
Build Back Better would also allocate $3.5 billion for converting U.S. factories for production of electrified or fuel cell vehicles, and revive incentives that could generate $3.7 billion for automotive communities by 2031.
Auto manufacturers could also benefit from $3 billion allocated to a Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program.
GM's head of global manufacturing, Gerald Johnson, told Reuters that federal spending could accelerate demand for electric vehicles, which is one reason the automaker has made flexibility a priority at Factory Zero.
If the Build Back Better legislation passes, GM will factor that into its plans, he said, adding: ""It does not change what we are doing.""
Factory Zero, opened in 1985, is one of 21 GM assembly and powertrain operations in the United States, and the first to get a makeover to begin assembling electric vehicles. 
Biden is expected to get a look at one of the first GMC Hummer EVs assembled at the plant. The first Hummer models will have starting prices above $100,000 - too much to qualify for proposed EV tax credits.
GM said it can save up to $15 billion by 2030, and even more after that, by re-purposing its factories and retraining its current workforce, rather than follow rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and build new factories in Southern and Western states.
GM's North American electric vehicle assembly capacity will reach 20% by 2025, and 50% by 2030, Johnson said.
Tesla captured nearly 80% of the U.S. electric vehicle market in 2020. Its share is expected to decline as more electric vehicles are launched. 
The company told Texas officials https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/austin-cheers-teslas-headquarters-move-local-home-buyers-left-edge-2021-10-11 that its factory workers there would earn about $47,000 a year. Factory workers at GM begin at $28 an hour, or about $56,000 a year, under their United Auto Workers agreement.
Plants that have battery-making and vehicle assembly in one complex - like the Tesla factory in Austin, Texas - can be more efficient, cutting transportation costs for batteries, said Mike Tracy, president of the Agile Group, a manufacturing consultancy. 
""GM is trying to avoid putting union workers out of business,"" Tracy said. 
Rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co added an assembly line for electric F-150 pickups at a plant in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford also has announced plans to build a sprawling electric vehicle assembly and battery complex in Tennessee https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-sk-invest-114-bln-add-electric-f-150-plant-three-battery-factories-2021-09-27. 

GM is trying to take advantage of a U.S. factory system that has excess capacity, Johnson said. Managing a mix of combustion and electric vehicles during the coming decade could mean using what is now extra space to avoid interrupting production as plants are retooled. 
""That footprint is an asset, it’s not an anchor,"" he said.

BYND has lost 11.3% in price over the past five days. And although the company expects to deliver long-term growth, its fourth-quarter guidance was below expectations. So, given that BYND is currently still trading at a lofty valuation, the question is, is the stock worth buying on its current dip? Read on.Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) is a plant-based meat products provider in the United States and internationally. The El Segundo, Calif.-based company’s shares declined after the company reported disappointing third-quarter results and issued fourth-quarter guidance that was below estimates on November 11. The stock slumped 19% during the session and closed 13% lower. Over the past five days, BYND has lost 11.3% in price to close yesterday’s trading session at $83.48. The stock has declined 32.9% year-to-date. Furthermore, BYND is trading well below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
The maker of faux meat is currently grappling with supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. The company pointed to low overall demand as a reason for its U.S. net revenues decline. And Beyond Meat President and CEO Ethan Brown expects “continued uncertainty for the balance of this year.” The company cut its third-quarter revenue forecast last month. Following the company’s third-quarter earnings release, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Ken Goldman slashed the stock’s price target to $54, keeping an underweight rating, while Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform. 
Ongoing operational challenges related to labor issues and uncertainty regarding COVID-19’s impact on demand levels are expected to affect the company’s revenues in the fourth quarter. And BYND expects to generate revenue in a range of $85 million to $110 million, which is lower than analysts’ expectations.

However, the stock retreated last week after the company reported its third-quarter earnings. Its business strength and accelerated adoption of digital finance over the past months should support UPST’s long-term growth. But, considering the company’s stretched valuation, is the stock an ideal buy in its recent dip? Read on.San Mateo, Calif.-based Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST) operates a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that aggregates consumer demand for loans and connects it to its network of AI-enabled bank partners. The stock has garnered significant investor attention so far this year. UPST shares have rallied 473.7% in price year-to-date on the back of substantial earnings growth. However, the stock slumped 18% on November 10 after the company reported its third-quarter results. Over the past month, UPST has lost 39.5% in price to close yesterday’s trading session at $236.01. It is currently trading above its 200-day moving average but below its 50-day moving average.
UPST failed to impress investors despite reporting substantial year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings that beat analyst estimates. Piper Sandler’s Arvind Ramnani accredited the stock’s selloff primarily to “elevated investor expectations and lack of quantification of its auto opportunity.”

DOHA (Reuters) -Qatar Airways is considering an imminent purchase of a freighter aircraft and is looking at an ""attractive proposition from Boeing (NYSE:BA)"", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said on Wednesday.
The comment from one of the world's largest cargo players is the latest indication that Qatar Airways may help inaugurate a new freighter version of Boeing's future 777X jetliner.
""We are seriously looking at placing a large cargo order, a freighter order, because ... as we are also growing our freight business, we need to be sustainable in that and we are going to imminently place a large freighter order,"" Al Baker said.
""Of course, I cannot tell you with whom we are going to place the order. But one thing I can say is that the proposal we have received from Boeing is very attractive to the airline.""
Qatar Airways says it operates 26 Boeing 777 freighters, 2 747-8 freighters and 6 Boeing 777-300ER mini-freighters.
""We don't only look at the price, we look at the performance, and I think the aircraft that Boeing is developing will outperform the current fleet that we have,"" Al Baker said.
Al Baker was speaking to reporters at a ceremony to present the passenger version of the world's largest twin-engined jetliner, the 777X, which arrived in Doha on Wednesday after staging a public debut at the Dubai Airshow.
The successor to Boeing's best-selling 777 wide-body passenger plane has been delayed by at least two and a half years amid uncertainty over the timetable for certification.
Al Baker said Qatar Airways expected to receive its first passenger version of the 777X in 2023. Boeing said this week it was sticking to plans to deliver the plane in that year, but stressed the timing of certification would depend on regulators.
A 777X freighter would seek to maintain Boeing's dominance of the market for dedicated cargo planes as Europe's Airbus markets a freight version of its A350, which secured a debut buyer at this week's Dubai Airshow.
The 777X freighter is expected to carry about 110 tonnes of cargo, compared with 109 tonnes for the A350 freighter.

Boeing has not said when it plans to launch the freighter.
""We're talking ... to several prospective customers and having advanced discussions with many of them on what they want and what the airplane would look like,"" Senior Vice President Commercial Sales and Marketing Ihssane Mounir told reporters.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Shares in Brazilian state-run power company Eletrobras plunged on Wednesday after it reported third-quarter net income of 965 million reais ($175.4 million), down 66% year-on-year, hit mainly by provisions relating to ongoing litigation.
The lawsuits relate to a compulsory energy loan program, which required industrial energy customers to provide money to pay for Brazil's electricity sector.
The government promised to repay the companies but this has been repeatedly postponed.
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, as the company is formally known, said on Tuesday adjustments in provisions for contingencies totaled 9.43 billion reais in the third quarter. This included a 5.25 billion reais reclassification to ""probable"" from ""remote"" for the so-called ""compulsory loan on electricity"" lawsuits.
Preferred shares in Eletrobras were down 4.5% and ordinary shares dropped 5.1% in morning trading, making it the top loser in the Bovespa index, which rose 0.1%.
Eletrobras, which is expected to be privatized in 2022, said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reached 5.6 billion reais, up 4% from a year earlier.
According to the company, the results were positively impacted by a strong operating performance especially in the transmission segment.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said that Eletrobras' operating figures were positive, but the compulsory loan provisions blurred the scene ahead of the privatisation, noting they could affect the future value of the company.
Net operating revenue totaled 9.96 billion reais, up 50% from a year earlier, positively influenced by effects from a periodic tariff review on its transmission business. 

Brazil has been facing its worst drought crisis in 90 years, which has severely affected hydropower generation and led the country to rely more on costly thermoelectric power plants, making electricity more expensive for consumers.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday said it will for the first time start selling spare parts and tools to the general public to perform their own repairs on some iPhones and Mac computers.
The self-service repair program comes after years of pressure from consumer groups have resulted in Apple providing greater access to repair manuals and genuine parts. 
In 2019, Apple started a program where independent repair shops can buy its parts, tools and manuals. Apple said there are now 2,800 independent shops in its program in addition to its 5,000 directly authorized repair providers.
Under the self-service program, Apple customers will be able to buy those parts directly to perform their own repairs after reading a manual. Apple said the online store will start with about 200 parts and tools aimed at fixing the most common issues with displays, batteries and cameras on iPhone 12 and 13 models.

The program will eventually extend to Mac computers that use Apple's M1 chip and later to less common repairs. Customers will be offered the same pricing on parts and tools as independent repair shops and will be able to return their used parts to Apple after completing a repair to receive a discount. 
Apple said the program will begin early next year in the United States and expand to more countries later in the year.

The state-owned carrier is restructuring under new management led by Tony Douglas after a failed bid last decade to compete with major Gulf carriers Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Asked about Airbus A320neo and Boeing 777X ordered by previous management, Douglas said the airline was focused on sustainable growth and that a final decision had not been made. 
Uncertainty over deliveries and when the industry would recover from the pandemic had added to the complexity of making a decision on future fleet plans.
""The manufactures can't confirm when they are going to be delivered and you have a market that you don't know when its going to recover.""
The airline had three years to decide on what it would do with the A320neo order, while a decision on the 777X jets was ""way down the road"". 
Airbus declined to comment. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Boeing's new version of its best-selling 777 twin aisle wide-body jet has been beset by delays, while supply chain issues have hit both manufacturers.
Etihad, which is in the midst of a five year downsizing to become what it calls a ""mid-sized carrier"", has 26 A320neo jets and 25 777X on order, according to the planemakers.
It would continue to take deliveries of Airbus A350-1000 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner liner jets, which Douglas said would become the backbone of the fleet that will trim to 65 aircraft.
Etihad has 93 aircraft, according to its website. Douglas also said the existing 30-strong A320 fleet would likely be halved as operations reduce with a focus on profitable routes.

It already plans to phase out its 5 777-300ER jets from the passenger fleet and has grounded its 10 Airbus A380s since the start of the pandemic. 
""When the market comes back sustainability, then we will look at how we will scale up. We are never going to get back into the madness,"" Douglas said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Opel will not split off its German factories from its operations, and production at the Eisenach plant will resume in January, Opel owner Stellantis and union IG Metall said on Wednesday, soothing fears over the marque's future.
Stellantis also said that the Grandland SUV, which was temporarily produced in France when Eisenach was shut down in September https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chip-shortage-leads-carmaker-opel-shut-german-plant-until-2022-2021-09-30 due to a global chip shortage, will be made exclusively in the German factory from the new year. 
German unions and politicians in the states have criticised Stellantis' communication on its plans for the two factories, in Russelsheim and Eisenach. They said it had not been made clear whether the plants would be legally split off from Opel and if Grandland production would return to Eisenach.
Stellantis had said in September that a split-off structure could be more efficient and flexible after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported this was under consideration.
IG Metall said in a statement on Wednesday that the works council and union representatives had agreed that such a split was ""off the table"". Eisenach will become its own company within Opel Automobile GmbH, while Ruesselsheim's legal structure will remain as it is, the union added.
""The outsourcing and break-up of Opel was prevented and employment secured. I hope that management will steer the company more constructively and transparently into the future from now on,"" Joerg Koehlinger of IG Metall said.

Stellantis, formed this year by the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's PSA Group, confirmed the news. 
An Opel supplier in France told Reuters earlier this week that it had received orders to supply parts for the Grandland to Eisenach and was told by Stellantis that production would start again there by February.

Spirit and Textron would bear the brunt as a big chunk of their manufacturing units are located in Wichita, Kansas, where just 53% of working age individuals are fully vaccinated, Jefferies said. 
Gulfstream, General Dynamic's aerospace unit, is also heavily exposed as only 48% of the working-age population around Savannah is vaccinated, said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu. 
The White House earlier this month extended a deadline for federal contractors to get vaccinated from Dec. 8 to Jan. 4. There are concerns that the mandate could compound worker shortages, and alongside there has been a rise in strikes as workers take advantage of the tight labor market to demand more pay and better conditions.
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) had warned last month that the it will lose 'several thousand' employees who refused to take COVID-19 vaccines
However, Jefferies believes Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s Intelligence & Space is one of those best insulated as its headquarters are located in a region where 79% of the working-age population is vaccinated. 
Jefferies analyst Kahyaoglu also said several questions remain around the vaccine mandate, including who would be liable if a supplier does not comply with the mandate and what could be the potential penalties.

""Additionally, it remains unknown whether costs related to vaccine-related loss of workers is an allowable cost for relief from the Federal government,"" the analyst added.
Spirit AeroSystems, Textron and GD did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Investing.com – TJX Companies stock (NYSE:TJX) traded 9% higher in early trade on Wednesday after the retailer said the current quarter had begun on a strong note, with August-October sales rising 20%.
CEO and President Ernie Herrman said the company is “in an excellent inventory position with most of the product needed for the holiday season either on hand or scheduled to arrive at our stores and online in time for the holidays”.
Comparable-store sales are up around 16% in November after net sales in the three months through October came in at $12.5 billion, beating estimates.
The company’s decision to boost its share repurchase plan by $500 million to take it up to $2 billion for the ongoing financial year was also aiding the gains in the share price.
August-October was the third consecutive three-month period when comparable store sales increased at least around 16%, according to the company.
Diluted earnings per share rose 24% to 84 cents and were higher than estimates.

Read on.San Francisco-based digital financial services company SoFi Technologies, Inc.’s (SOFI) shares climbed more than 12% in price after the company made its stock market debut on June 1, 2021, which was facilitated by a merger with a special purpose acquisition company named Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>","A new quantum computer startup from Harvard, MIT raises $17M","By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif (Reuters) - A new quantum computer startup born from researchers at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) called QuEra Computing said on Wednesday it raised $17 million from investors, including Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc.
It’s the latest quantum computer hardware maker to come out of the lab at a time when funding for the nascent technology is booming.
While there are various technologies for creating so-called quantum bits or qubits where the computations happen, QuEra’s qubits use neutral atoms in a vacuum chamber and use lasers to cool and control them. 
“From 2015 when we had an empty lab with nothing to 2017, the work that we were doing at Harvard and MIT, we were already at the stage where we could control 51 of these neutral atom qubits,” said Alex Keesling, QuEra CEO and co-inventor of the technology. He said this technology was easy to scale up and that QuEra would have a 1000-qubit computer in two years. Today it has a 256-qubit machine, he said.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp, whose quantum computers are already available through the cloud, is aiming for a 1000-plus qubit machine in 2023 https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmap. Although it's hard to compare the performance of the different machines just based on the number of qubits, say several researchers of quantum computers.

For those looking to try out the QuEra machine, Keesling said the goal is to make it available through the cloud by the third quarter of next year.
While there is some debate about when quantum computers will be able to crack real-world problems, researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers, potentially making possible tasks such as mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to boosting the power of artificial intelligence.

The S&P 500 index has risen nearly 25% so far. The index closed at 4,700.90 on Tuesday. 
Here is a summary of some analysts' forecast for the index at the end of 2022:
BROKERAGE NAME S&P500 TARGET 
@ END 2022 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) 4,400 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) 5,100-5,300 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) 5,100 
RBC 5,050 
Morgan Stanley: ""While earnings for the overall index remain durable, there will be greater dispersion of winners and losers and growth rates will slow materially... 2022 will be more about stocks than sectors or styles, in our view.""
Wells Fargo: ""Persistent supply shortages and inflation pressures lead us to adjust the magnitudes of some 2022 targets, but we believe the global economy should still mark an above-average pace next year. More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged."" 
Goldman Sachs: ""Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.""

""In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue."" RBC: ""We continue to see 2022 as a solid year for the U.S. equity market, but with more moderate gains than we've experienced in 2021.""
""While we remain vigilant on margins, we don't think it makes sense to assume the worst on this front given the strong track record that companies have had managing through cost pressures even before the pandemic.""

Investing.com –  Target  stock (NYSE:TGT) traded 3.3% lower in Wednesday’s premarket, joining the reaction to Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) earnings a day earlier, as concerns over record-high inflation and a likely hit to margins overshadow retailers’ efforts to convey a bright outlook.
Chief financial officer Michael Fiddelke told a conference call that the company is having to absorb at least some of the higher costs it's incurring, as it fights to defend market share. 
“We’re definitely protecting price,” Fiddelke said. “We’re seeing cost increases that are higher than our retail increases.”
Reflecting that, gross margins fell to 28% from around 31% a year earlier. The company attributed the compression in margins to higher merchandise and freight costs and increased supply chain expenses from higher compensation and headcount in the company's distribution centers.
The company kept its operating margin guidance at 8% for the full year, despite seeing it eroded to 70 basis points in the third quarter to 7.8% from a year ago.  One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Total revenue rose by a better-than-expected 13% to $25.65 billion. Adjusted for items, it earned $3.03 per share, higher than estimates. Equally, the company nudged up its same-store revenue guidance for the current quarter to around 10%, up from its prior forecast of approximately 9%.
Target's update comes a day after rival Walmart also warned of fast-rising cost pressures, and a day after the Labor Department, said the consumer price index rose 6.2% in October, its fastest growth in 31 years.

Retail sales in Canada rebounded in August thanks to the easing of restrictions in several parts of the country, which included in-store capacity limits and a temporary ban on the sale of discretionary goods.
Loblaw said that demand for back-to-school and Thanksgiving seasons was also strong, signaling a return to pre-pandemic routines. 
The company also said its online sales remained above pre-pandemic levels and are on track to exceed C$3 billion in 2021, which would be higher than the C$2.8 billion recorded a year earlier.
As a result, Loblaw said it now expects adjusted profit per share to rise by the low-to-mid thirty percent range, compared with a prior forecast of low-to-mid twenties percentage growth.
Revenue rose to C$16.05 billion ($12.77 billion) in the third quarter from C$15.67 billion from a year earlier, surpassing analyst estimates of C$15.89 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net earnings available to common shareholders rose to C$431 million, or C$1.27 per share, in the three months ended Oct. 9, from C$342 million, or 96 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. 

Excluding one-time items, Loblaw earned C$1.59 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of C$1.48 per share.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plans to double staff numbers at its charging and energy division, roll out new payment technology next year and strike more alliances to take on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in a key electric vehicle (EV) battleground: power infrastructure.
By ensuring there are enough fast-charging plugs - and enough power - for the EVs it wants to sell, Europe's biggest carmaker hopes to convince drivers worried about battery ranges that they can ditch their fossil fuel cars for good.
Underlining its electric ambition, Volkswagen has drafted in power industry veteran Elke Temme, who spent nearly two decades at German energy companies RWE and Innogy, to help the carmaker get in better shape to take on Tesla.
In the job since January, Temme, 53, has been tasked with bundling the carmaker's various power activities such as procuring energy, enabling customers to charge their cars at home, and on the road, and selling the electricity required.
Getting this done will require a bigger workforce and Temme plans to double the staff at Volkswagen's European charging and energy division, known as Elli, to about 300 in 2022, having already tripled it this year, she told Reuters in an interview.
""We're investing in huge growth areas that don't always have to be profitable right away. We always see these investments in the overall context of our group strategy,"" she said. ""That's why building up a comprehensive infrastructure is key.""
Temme declined to specify the budget she has been given but said Volkswagen, led by Tesla admirer Herbert Diess, has approved the investment requests for the division, which also sells home battery storage systems similar to Tesla's Powerwall.
Volkswagen leads the pack worldwide by far with its investment plans for EVs and batteries through 2030, according to a Reuters analysis https://reut.rs/3wQop01, and it is planning to spend 35 billion euros on battery EVs by 2025. Global automaker EV & battery investments, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-UN/AUTOS-EV/jnvwexwgqvw/chart.png 
PLAYING CATCH UP
But when it comes to the networks of fast-chargers that many analysts believe are crucial for bringing EVs into the mainstream, VW has some catching up to do.
Tesla has been rolling out high-performance Superchargers for years and has a global network of about 30,000 fast-chargers that it says can give a 200 km (125 mile) boost in 15 minutes. 
The company said in October that its own network has doubled in the past 18 months - and will triple over the next two years.
Volkswagen, meanwhile expects its network of fast-chargers to nearly quadruple to about 45,000 by 2025 - when it aims to overhaul Tesla as the global EV market leader - with 18,000 EV pumps in Europe, 17,000 in China and 10,000 in North America. 
Volkswagen in March said it plans to spend 400 million euros on expanding its fast-charging network on the continent by then.
But that's a drop in the ocean compared with the 5 billion euros the European Union reckons is needed every year until 2040 to expand charging infrastructure on the continent, and it is raising the pressure on utilities and governments to step up.
In Europe, the Volkswagen group is a shareholder in the EU's fast-charging venture Ionity, along with rival carmakers BMW, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Hyundai.
It has also teamed up with energy firms such as Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Britain's BP (NYSE:BP) and Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) to plug geographical gaps and form the blueprint for how funding for EV infrastructure can be split across industries.
""Various models are conceivable, from product partnerships and joint ventures to M&A,"" said Temme. Global automaker EV & battery investments, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-UN/AUTOS-EV/myvmnkgmypr/chart.png 
CARS AND POWER
Tesla has already shown that when it comes to EVs, just selling cars no longer cuts it. It has adopted a model that offers customers everything from cars to battery storage to solar panels as well as electricity https://reut.rs/3FjTlc2 in some U.S. states.
Volkswagen is now selling power to retail clients that drive an EV or plug-in hybrids. One of its tariffs - which is available to customers who don't own a VW - has attracted more than 10,000 clients since its launch in July, Temme said.
She said VW was planning to make its fast-chargers available for all EV drivers, unlike Tesla which has so far kept its supercharging network just for Tesla drivers - with the exception of a pilot programme in the Netherlands.
""We are pursuing a different approach than Tesla when it comes to charging infrastructure roll-out,"" said Temme. 
""We want an open, non-discriminatory charging network and will develop our services to make our offer more comfortable, simpler, more attractive.""
Volkswagen says its open-for-all approach means buyers of its EVs can charge at more than 250,000 existing public charging points across Europe - from various providers with various charging speeds.
The problem is that charging protocols and payment methods can vary across vendors, potentially turning the act of refueling an EV into a time-consuming and messy undertaking.
From the first quarter of 2022, Volkswagen plans to offer ""Plug & Charge"" technology in Europe to make the process smoother. 
The car will store the owner's payment details and make a contactless payment when the charging plug is attached to the EV at refuelling stations set up for the service.
While these are new challenges for established carmakers, Temme, who witnessed first-hand the abrupt shift of Germany's utilities away from nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, believes they can be mastered.
""Utilities must reinvent themselves and transition from nuclear and coal to renewables. In the automotive industry, including at Volkswagen, the question is currently how to consistently shift the focus from conventional vehicles to sustainable mobility,"" she said.

""These challenges are of similar magnitude.""

Investing.com – Lowe’s stock (NYSE:LOW) traded nearly 2% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as strong demand for tools and building materials drove the company’s third-quarter sales and earnings past analysts’ estimates.
The home improvement retailer also raised its annual guidance and expanded its buyback program by $3 billion to $12 billion.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged, with investors focusing on more earnings reports from big-name retailers as well as economic data from the housing sector.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 35 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The three major indices closed higher Tuesday, boosted by strong earnings from the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) as well as larger than expected retail sales growth for October, giving the economy a lift at the start of the fourth quarter.
That said, the gains were limited and the major averages are struggling to push significantly higher as higher inflation as well as the recovering economy look set to push the Federal Reserve to speed up the phase-out of asset purchases, bringing forward the likely first interest rate hike.
This was illustrated by comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who called on Tuesday for two rate hikes in 2022 to bring inflation expectations back under control. Bullard has been at the hawkish end of the policy spectrum for the last couple of years and his voice is still - for now - a minority one.
Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 index to rise by just 9% by the end of next year, compared with gains of around 25% this year, while Morgan Stanley actually looks for the broad-based benchmark index to move lower in 2022, dropping by around 6% in its base case. 
October building permits and housing starts are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to show a strengthening housing market.
Turning to corporate earnings, home improvement chain Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) raised its full-year sales forecast on Wednesday, boosted by higher demand from builders and contractors.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) also raised its fourth-quarter forecast after its third-quarter sales jumped 13%, as shoppers flocked to its shops, looking for back-to-school supplies and early holiday gifts.
TJX (NYSE:TJX) is also due to report quarterly earnings before the open, while the likes of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and networking and cloud computing giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) are also due Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Visa (NYSE:V) will be in the spotlight after the world’s largest retailer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), decided to stop accepting credit cards issued by the company in the U.K. from January. 
Crude prices weakened Wednesday as dollar strength and a mixed American Petroleum Institute report on domestic stockpiles. U.S. crude inventories rose 655,000 barrels last week, but gasoline stocks fell by 2.8 million barrels, more than expected, and indicative of strong domestic demand. 
Official figures from the Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $79.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $81.87. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,865.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1326.

Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other major retailers that keep troves of data on shoppers' purchases are selling more digital ads on their own websites and in stores -- including pop-up banners and search-bar keywords -- to marketers eager to pitch their products. 
The retailers want to tap their insights on consumer behavior to attract ad dollars from packaged goods manufacturers like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) at a time when companies face new challenges in targeting marketing to people online.
Walmart said on Tuesday that sales at its advertising business increased nearly 240% in the third quarter on a two-year basis. The ads help ""suppliers and marketplace providers sell more while creating a new profit opportunity for us,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said. Walmart's income from advertising is growing not only in the United States, but also at its Mexican business and its Flipkart.com unit in India. 
Last week, U.S. grocery chain Albertsons launched its own media network, Albertsons Media Collective. In October, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co's Kroger Precision Marketing - borne from the acquisition of a data analytics firm in 2015 - launched a private advertising marketplace that will give brands a tool to help them buy digital ad space more efficiently.
The advertising push comes as other marketing avenues are closing.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in April rolled out privacy changes that prevent advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in 2023 will kill off Chrome web browser cookies, which save information about users' browsing habits, helping advertisers determine product interest. 
Retailers, meanwhile, hope to entice manufacturers to buy ads on their websites and shopping apps. From Britain's Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) to U.S.-based  Target  (NYSE:TGT), retailers have been trying for years https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-retail-advertising-insight-idCAKBN1KG0CZ-OCABS to carve out a niche in the media world. But now, booming ecommerce sales help them gather more potentially valuable data on shopper behavior.
ECOMMERCE BOOM
To be sure, the only retailer that has come close to challenging Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google's dominance is Amazon.com, whose yearly U.S. advertising revenue has surpassed $15 billion. Reuters revealed https://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-advertising-idCNL1N2HA0UZ last year that Walmart was on track to earn nearly $1 billion in advertising sales in 2020. That compares to Facebook and Google's 2020 U.S. ad sales of roughly $40 billion each, according to eMarketer.
Walmart wants to expand its advertising business after more than a decade of stuttering progress. In August, https://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-media-idCNL4N2PW0Y5 the retailer upgraded its platform to allow brands a demand-side platform that will help them buy digital ad space more efficiently.
Nearly all of the top 10 retailers by worldwide sales including Target and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) have launched advertising businesses, and more are expected to follow, said Eric Franchi, a partner at MathCapital, which invests in marketing and media startups.

Target said its media business, Roundel, is an important part of its business and a driver of growth.
Brands spent 66% more on retail media during the 2020 holidays than they did a year earlier, according to Skai, a data company that works with brands that buy ads from Amazon, Walmart and Target.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) traded nearly 1% higher in Wednesday’s premarket on reports the regulators will this week authorize Covid-19 vaccine booster shots for all adults.
The Food and Drug Administration is sitting Thursday and vaccine experts at Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent committee Friday to discuss merits of the case and approve the company’s third jab for all those 18 years and older.
The U.S. is now averaging more than 85,000 cases daily, about an 18% increase compared to two weeks ago. So far, those at least 65 or vulnerable were eligible for a third shot of the company’s vaccine.
The company recently raised its guidance, mostly banking on sales of its Comirnaty vaccine to boost sales. It now sees $81.5 billion in sales in 2021 at the midpoint of its forecast range, including $36 billion in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine. That's $2.5 billion more than the previous forecast.
Adding to the positive sentiment for the stock was the company asking the FDA on Tuesday to approve its Covid-19 antiviral pill.
The antiviral pill is one of only three oral medicines so far to prove their efficacy against Covid-19, along with treatments from Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). Pfizer claims to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%. Merck's molnupiravir boasts an efficacy ratio of just over 50%. 
Gains from the pill could be limited though as the company will allow generic manufacturers to make the medicine while waiving royalties on sales in low- and middle-income countries."

(Reuters) - A language furor rattling corporate Quebec has left some companies scrambling to improve the French-speaking skills of their C-suite executives to avoid the kind of public relations nightmare that engulfed Air Canada earlier this month.
Language remains a sensitive issue in Quebec, the only Canadian province whose sole official language is French and where the dominance of English in the 1970s sparked the rise of the separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ).
The Air Canada incident cast a spotlight on how some top executives of prominent companies got away without speaking the language, driving calls for improving French, and raising questions about Quebec's ability to attract talent.
""There are a number of entities that have spoken to us about that consideration being heightened in light of these comments that have been put forth by Air Canada,"" said Adam Dean, founding partner at Dean Executive Search over the need for French. 
Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau caused an uproar with comments suggesting that he did not need to speak French, which along with English is one of Canada's two official languages, even though the Montreal-based airline is officially bilingual. Rousseau later apologized and pledged to improve his French. 
""It's important that the presidents of Quebec companies speak French,"" Quebec Premier François Legault said on Friday.
Air Canada, which took federal government aid during the pandemic, faced criticism from both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. 
The backlash could complicate the search for a new head of Montreal-headquartered Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co, whose current CEO is bilingual but has hired uni-lingual English-executives in the past.
'POLITICAL AGENDA' 
CN shareholder TCI Fund Management Ltd has proposed Jim Vena, a former operations specialist at both CN and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), to head the railway.
One rail source said Vena, when at CN, could understand and speak some French. Reuters could not immediately reach Vena for comment.
French was not part of TCI's early criteria for a new CEO and the Air Canada incident would not impact those views, a source familiar with TCI's thinking said.
TCI did not respond to a request for comment.
CN ensures that its customers, employees and the public can receive services and communications in both official languages, a CN spokesman said when asked whether the new CEO would need to speak French.
Representatives for Freeland and Legault declined comment on CN's CEO hiring process.
But some CEOs are brushing up their French.
The English-speaking CEO of Laurentian Bank, Rania Llewellyn, is ""committed to improving her French,"" a bank spokesman said. The U.K.-born head of Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin Group postponed a speech in English speech scheduled for Monday in order to improve his French skills.
The uproar is raising questions over Quebec's ability to attract talent. The province is separately weighing language legislation that companies say would it make it more cumbersome to hire employees who speak English, in addition to French.
""It is more difficult by virtue of the fact there are parts of the country where French is not spoken, so if that is the requirement for the role, it can be challenging,"" Dean said.
About 75% of Canada's population speaks English and about 23% speaks French, some of whom are bilingual, according to the country's 2016 census https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-languages-bilingualism/publications/statistics.html, its most recent.
Shareholders say they care more about performance.

""As a shareholder you want the best CEO you can find,"" said one Air Canada shareholder who nevertheless said that Rousseau had erred in his comments. And a portfolio manager who holds CN stock dismissed the kerfuffle as political. Both declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
""As a stockholder I don't have a political agenda,"" said the fund manager. ""I have an agenda on whether they are run well.""

LONDON (Reuters) -You almost have to re-read the small print for a reminder that stocks may ever fall again. 
The oft-used compliance disclaimer that the value of your investments may go down as well as up seems to be largely ignored by stock investors this days. 
And after a three-year winning streak, fund managers are clearly betting on another.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s penultimate monthly fund manager survey of 2021 shows the biggest overweight U.S. equities in eight years - with as few as 8% of the 388 respondents, managing more than $1 trillion in assets, claiming to be underweight stocks at large.
And a weekly JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) client survey had 60% planning to add even more equity exposure over the coming days and weeks.
As 2022 investment outlooks from banks and funds stream in, the basic arguments for sticking with stocks are pretty simple. 
If a global pandemic and the sharpest economic contraction in a generation didn't spark a negative year for expensive equity indices - many wonder just what will right now. 
Keep riding the liquidity swell until it's finally drained still seems to be the consensus. 
Central banks may already be cutting emergency supports with inflation back on the radar - but the last place you want to be is in bonds unless you think we're heading back into a slump within 12 months.
Few do.
It's also hard to argue with the fact that stocks don't often go down over a full calendar year anyhow. The S&P500 has only ended in the red about one in four years since 1960.
For a more diversified spread of equity risk, such as MSCI's all-country stock index, it's been the best rolling three-year period since the dot.com bubble 20 years ago and there have been only 4 down years since then. The index has precisely doubled from the deep but brief pandemic trough of March 2020.
Aside from the famous boom and bust at the turn of the millennium, no three-year period has been better for stocks in the 34-year history of that global index.
Given those metrics, the overwhelming consensus and the apparent lack of alternatives, you're inclined to sit up and take notice when what was one of the most bullish houses on Wall St forecasts a drop in stocks in 2022.
Just this week  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) - one of the most vocal and accurate Wall St forecasters of a V-shaped market recovery after the pandemic hit last year - said it sees the S&P500 some 6% below current levels by the end of next year.
That's hardly a signal to run for the hills - but any negative sign on stock market forecasts is noteworthy these days and only the banking collapse of 2008 generated a more negative year for the S&P500 since the dot.com crash.
REMOVING STABILIZERS
Morgan Stanley's reasoning was far from alarmist, preferring to stress a 'normalizing' of growth and asset prices. 
It talked of the ""training wheels"" coming off the post-COVID recovery next year as policy supports are gradually removed and financial assets to have to balance on their own for a change.
""Markets are facing many 'normal' mid-cycle problems: better growth colliding with higher inflation, shifting policy and more expensive valuations.""
Keeping its call in the context of nerves about tighter credit and financial conditions, it sees 10-year Treasury yields ending 2022 back at 2.10% from 1.6% today - basically only back to where it was in the middle of 2019.
Yet even these relatively anodyne forecasts are outliers.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects another 9% on the S&P500 through next year, JPMorgan sees the index adding another 6% through the middle of next year at least and UBS sees it 6% higher by the end of 2022.
Of course some of this is just about timing - just when does the wind change on policy mixed with still largely unknowable macro variables around inflation and even the pandemic itself.
Unigestion portfolio manager Olivier Marciot said he's cautious about the year ahead but retains exposure to risk assets while watching central bank policy unfold.
""History has demonstrated that trying to anticipate the actual change in financial conditions from an accommodative to a tightening situation usually yields disappointing results.""
What's more, forecasts already on the table are from where we stand in November. And a lot can happen in illiquid year-end markets when investors may be itching to bank profits.
Already the dollar is rising sharply on a mix of inflation and interest rate concerns but also jarring geopolitics between western allies and Russia and China - from the Belarus border to Ukraine and Taiwan and even in space. And a rising dollar effectively tightens world financial conditions on its own.

Military flashpoints or related energy price shocks and power blackouts in Europe and elsewhere could make for an even nervier year-end than usual.
Come New Year's Eve, maybe even Morgan Stanley's 2022 call will start to look bullish.

(Reuters) -The United States has signed contracts worth about $1 billion for doses of the antibody-based COVID-19 treatment from Britain's GSK and U.S.-based Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), as countries seek to secure promising options beyond vaccines. 
The drugmakers said on Wednesday the U.S. orders bring the total number of doses to be supplied to more than 750,000 globally, without specifying how many doses of the treatment, sotrovimab, the U.S. government had signed up for.
However, other public deals for the drug include 10,000 doses for Canada https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gsk-supply-10000-doses-covid-19-drug-canada-2021-10-04 and up to 220,000 doses for the European Union https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-signs-deal-with-gsk-supply-potential-covid-drug-2021-07-28. Values of those orders have not been disclosed.
U.S. deliveries of the treatment, branded Xevudy, are expected by Dec. 17 and the government will also have an option to buy more doses through March 2022, GSK and Vir said in their joint statement. 
While vaccines remain at the heart of the long-term fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, treatments including game-changing antiviral pills from Merck and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), offer options to contain infections and save lives.
Pfizer said on Tuesday it was seeking U.S. authorisation of its experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill that cut the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89% in a clinical trial.
GSK-Vir's sotrovimab has shown to reduce that risk by 79% in trials https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/study-confirms-gsk-vir-antibody-drug-reduces-hospitalization-death-covid-19-2021-06-21. 
Unlike oral options from Merck and Pfizer, sotrovimab is given via an infusion. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies which are lab-generated compounds that mimic the body's natural defences.
The therapy was authorised for emergency use https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-gives-emergency-use-approval-gsk-vir-covid-19-antibody-drug-2021-05-26 in the United States in May to prevent mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 from worsening. The European regulator has given its go-ahead for use by member states, although EU-wide approval is still pending.
""Given ongoing evidence, which demonstrates its ability to maintain activity against the tested circulating variants of concern, including Delta, we are confident sotrovimab will continue to be important,"" Vir Chief Executive George Scangos said.
Last week, GSK and Vir said the antibody treatment was shown in a trial to work as well when given as a shot in the arm when administered via the standard infusion, potentially offering more convenience.
Sotrovimab brought in sales https://www.gsk.com/media/7228/q3-2021-results-announcement.pdf of 130 million pounds ($175 million) for GSK in the first nine months of 2021.
Similar products are offered or being developed by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Celltrion.

Last month U.S. authorities said the government would control distribution https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/govt-control-distribution-gskvir-covid-19-antibody-us-fda-2021-10-08 of sotrovimab in the country.

Investing.com – Visa stock (NYSE:V) traded over 1% lower in Wednesday’s premarket as the world’s largest retailer, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), decided to stop accepting credit cards issued by the company in the U.K. from January.
According to Bloomberg, Amazon has begun to inform its customers of the change, fixing January 19 as the data when the change comes into effect. The retailer blamed high fees charged by Visa for its decision.
Amazon customers can still use Visa debit cards, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Amex credit cards as well as Visa credit cards issued outside of the U.K., according to the Bloomberg report.
The move is another indirect consequence of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. Visa raised its interchange fees on digital payments between the U.K. and the EU to 1.5% from 0.3% in October, and raised the cross-border fee on online debit card payments to 1.15% from 0.2%. The EU, by contrast, caps the interchange fees that card companies can charge. Mastercard is also understood to be planning to raise charges for payments from U.K. customers to European merchants.
The move also reflects the challenge to the market power of established card giants from alternative payments systems, as fintech startups encroach more and more on their traditional space. 
Just last week, Amazon expanded its partnership with Buy-Now-Pay-Later specialist Affirm that will ensure the latter's platform is embedded in the retailer’s digital wallet in the U.S.
Australian-based Afterpay (ASX:APT) was snapped up for $29 billion by Square in August, and European BNPL leader Klarna is expected to file for an initial public offering before the end of the year, having been valued at $45 billion in its a funding round earlier this year.
BNPL firms rode the pandemic-fueled demand as cash-starved young consumers hunted for options beyond credit cards. Consistent demand from merchants for new ways to grow their sales, and the global growth in omnichannel commerce, is also fueling their rise."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 underperforming after a hot U.K. inflation release pointed to an early Bank of England rate hike and rising Covid-19 cases hitting travel and leisure stocks.
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France edged higher, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.
U.K. consumer prices rose 4.2% on the year in October, surging to a 10-year high, data showed earlier Wednesday. This represents a sharp jump from 3.1% the previous month and is more than double the central bank’s medium term target of 2%. 
The Bank of England is expected to become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic, with this release cementing expectations for the December meeting. 
The equivalent inflation data from the Eurozone is due later in the session, but the European Central Bank has guided towards a more patient stance in terms of rate hikes.
Travel stocks underperformed as the fear of Covid-driven restrictions returned: Germany reported over 52,000 new cases on Tuesday, another all-time high, while Ireland's government recommended working from home for all those who can, in an effort to stem rising hospital admissions.
In corporate news, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock fell 1.7% after the German auto giant announced plans to double staff numbers at its charging and energy division, part of its aim to take on U.S. rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in a key electric vehicle battleground: power infrastructure. 
The company's management, which has flagged the need for widespread job cuts at its conventional engine operations in recent years, is under pressure to show that the energy transition can create jobs as well as destroy them.
Nokia (NYSE:NOK) stock rose 0.6% after the Finnish telecommunications company announced plans to launch a cloud-based software subscription service.
Sage (LON:SGE) stock rose 1.1% despite the British software company reporting a 10% drop in full-year organic operating profit following heavy investment in its cloud offer, while renewable energy specialist SSE (LON:SSE) fell 5.3% after saying it is looking at selling a stake in its networks division.
The major equity indices in Europe received a negative handover from Asia, after Japan's exports snapped seven months of double-digit growth in October, growth slowing to only 9.4% year-on-year.
Global supply constraints hit Japan's major manufacturers, particularly the country’s car industry. Such trends have already been evidenced in the Eurozone, where German industrial output and exports have weakened sharply in the last three months. 
Crude prices weakened Wednesday after a mixed report from the American Petroleum Institute which showed U.S. crude inventories rose 655,000 barrels last week, but gasoline stocks fell by 2.8 million barrels, more than expected. That suggests final demand is still strong despite prices hitting a seven-year high nationwide and trading around all-time highs in key markets such as California.  
A coordinated release of strategic oil reserves to dampen oil prices was one of the issues reportedly discussed by Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping on their telephone call on Monday.  
Official figures from the Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $79.24 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $81.93. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,860.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1319.

Office property firms in the UK are gradually recovering after battling lower rental levels and steep decline in valuation in the wake of the pandemic, as people increasingly return to cities, while more spacious retail parks have benefited during the health crisis.
""Demand is firmly focused on the very best (office) space, with an emphasis on sustainability, wellness, shared and flexible space and excellent transport connections,"" Chief Executive Officer Simon Carter said in a statement.
The Broadgate Estate owner, which counts office space as its biggest segment, said a per-share measure that reflects the value of its buildings, EPRA Net Tangible Assets, rose 5.1% to 681 pence, while overall portfolio valuation increased 2.9%.
The company said rent collection at its retail portfolio was 96% for the half-year period, while it was entirely collected for the office spaces.
The FTSE 100 firm said profit after tax came in at 370 million pounds ($497.95 million) for the six months ended Sept. 30, from a loss of 730 million pounds a year earlier.

British Land's bigger rival Landsec also swung to a half-year profit on Tuesday, helped by ""resilient"" rents at its prime Central London-focused office portfolio.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk sold another $973 million in stock to pay taxes after exercising options on Tuesday, filings showed after the electric vehicle maker's shares rebounded during regular trade.
Musk acquired 2.1 million shares worth $2.2 billion at the Tuesday closing price and sold 934,091 for $973 million to pay taxes, the SEC filings showed.
In a sector surge spearheaded by Rivian Automotive Inc and Lucid Group Inc, Tesla Inc rose 4.1% to close at $1,054.73, leaving its market capitalization down about $187 billion since before Musk began selling shares https://www.reuters.com/business/teslas-musk-sold-934091-shares-satisfy-tax-withholding-obligations-filing-2021-11-16 last week.
Rivian's stock jumped 15%, with the EV maker now up over 120% since its initial public offer last Wednesday. 
Rivian disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that its underwriters bought 22.95 million additional shares, boosting the total size of the IPO. Including those shares, Rivian's market capitalization rose to $153 billion, overtaking Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) by $14 billion and making the Irvine, California, company the world's third-most valuable carmaker. Tesla market cap eclipses that of top 8 rival carmakers combined, https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-MUSK/mopanldgrva/chart.png 
Lucid surged nearly 24% after it said reservations for its cars rose to 13,000 in the third quarter and that it is confident it will produce 20,000 of its upcoming Lucid Air sedans in 2022.
The gain in Lucid's shares elevated its stock market value to $90 billion, overtaking Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and leaving it $1 billion short of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Over the past week, Musk has sold about 8.2 million Tesla shares for around $8.8 billion. Those sales fulfill almost half of his pledge on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. 
Musk began selling shares last week after floating the idea in a Twitter poll https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-asks-followers-twitter-whether-he-should-sell-10-his-tesla-stock-2021-11-06.
With electric-car makers increasingly in demand on Wall Street, Tesla's stock has surged more than 150% in the past 12 months. 

""There's still plenty of buying interest because I still think ultimately investors are viewing this as a phase and viewing pullbacks as an opportunity,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market economist at OANDA.
""If you ask me where the share price is going to be six months from now, 12 months from now? I'd say it's more likely to be 20% higher than 20% lower.""

279,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 12:55AM ET</span>",Australian researchers to study how Tesla car batteries can power grid,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's University of Queensland (UQ) on Wednesday said it would recruit Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc car owners around the world to analyse if the vehicle's spare battery capacity could support the energy grid and even power homes in the future.
The university has partnered with analytics platform Teslascope for the research project, which it said would be a world-first trial that would check how owners of electric vehicles (EV) currently drive and charge their vehicles. 
For the first phase of the study, Tesla owners in Australia, the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Britain can apply. The programme could be expanded later to include other electric vehicle companies.
With increasing numbers of electric vehicles globally, scientists are looking to find how the batteries can provide other cleaner energy services besides helping lower emissions in the transport industry.
Researchers at UQ said most EVs are driven only one-eighth of its daily driving range of 400 km (249 miles), providing opportunities to store energy and export power to the grid using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) chargers.
""(The study) will not only help to inform EV policy internationally, but importantly assess the feasibility of using EVs as batteries-on-wheels,"" Jake Whitehead, Research Fellow at UQ, told Reuters.
V2G technology is a connection between the EV and the grid through which power can flow from the grid to the vehicle and vice-versa. That potentially enables car owners to sell energy to the network, while utilities could use electric cars as a backstop during peak demand periods.

The study, which aims to initially recruit 500 Tesla owners, will collect usage data through the vehicle's software interface and in return users will be offered a free premium subscription to Teslascope for a year.
Australia last week pledged A$178 million ($132 million) to ramp up the rollout of charging stations for electric vehicles, but did not set targets to phase out petrol cars.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's high-yield bond managers are largely staying away from new debt deals as turmoil in China's property sector has roiled the region's bond markets, even as they very cautiously buy into companies they think have been oversold in secondary markets.
The region's high-yield - or junk - bond market has been in turmoil for the past two months as China Evergrande Group struggles to survive, and investors try to assess which other cash-strapped Chinese developers will be unable to make scheduled payments. 
Prices have tumbled and returns fallen, making it harder for companies to issue new debt. The returns of 43 high-yield funds measured by Morningstar are down 15.8% so far in 2021, compared to a 1.14% gain over the same period last year.
""High yield has not performed well, everyone is more cautious and aware that if you take on a loss now, that is going to affect your full year performance,"" said a Hong Kong-based debt capital markets banker who declined to be named as he was not permitted to speak to media. 
""Usually after Thanksgiving you start to see fund managers ruling off their books, but this year that is already happening,"" he said. 
Just one high-yield deal has been carried out in Asia so far in November, when Indonesian oil and gas serving business Medco Laurel Tree Pte raised $394 million. By comparison, high-yield deals totalled $5.7 billion in September and October, according to Dealogic.
An estimated $3.9 billion worth of high-yield debt will mature before the end of the year, the data showed. 
""It is common for issuance activity to drop in response to market volatility – investor demand is poor and borrowing costs are high, so issuers who are not forced to issue prefer to wait for conditions to improve,"" said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt Asia Pacific, at fund manager abrdn. 
VNET Group Inc, the Chinese data centre operator, last week pulled a $300 million U.S.-dollar bond deal because of tepid demand. 
Despite a recent rebound in the prices of bonds issued by Chinese real estate developers, their yields remained at levels where refinancing is unfeasible for most high-yield developers, said Ek Pon Tay, emerging market debt senior portfolio manager at BNP Asset Management.
However, ""given the China real estate developer sector overall is pricing in a large degree of credit stress and the gradual pace of easing so far, I recently added issuers with relatively lower refinancing risk,"" Tay added. 
Average yields for speculative-grade Chinese corporate issuers' dollar debt hit a record high of 28.54% on Tuesday. While yields tumbled more than 330 basis points late last week after some investors interpreted headlines in Chinese state media as hinting at an easing of finance restrictions they remained at an eye-watering 25.24%. 

""This type of volatile wild market phenomena is not often seen and opens up opportunities to be positioned in quality names,"" said Carol Lye, Brandywine Global associate portfolio manager.
""But caution is still warranted with volatility likely to remain as various property companies are still in a tight liquidity position.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Commonwealth Bank warned fierce competition in its key home loan market was hurting its margins ""considerably"", triggering a big sell-off in one of the world's most expensive banking stocks on Wednesday. 
The country's No. 1 lender issued the caution as it reported first quarter cash profit was up by a fifth on the back of above-peer growth in home and business loans. 
CBA has outperformed its rivals over the past year thanks to its vast branch network and technology that has helped it take advantage of a red-hot property market and a softer-than-expected economic hit from the pandemic.
However, the quarterly update showed that revenues were flat and the bank's net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of profitability, was ""considerably lower"" because of mortgage competition and a low interest rate environment. Fees were also lower, CBA said. 
Shares in CBA, which had risen 34% over the past year to a record A$110.19 on Nov. 8, fell nearly a tenth to a near four-month low of A$98.75 after the update, their sharpest fall since March 2020. The stock was trading between 7% and 8% lower on Wednesday afternoon.
""CBA has been priced to perfection, trading on a significant premium relative to its peers, and this trading update to me shows that the extent of that premium is not justified,"" said Azib Khan, a banking analyst at Morgans Financial. 
""What we are seeing is a correction to that premium, which should take place.""
CBA did not disclose specifics on the net interest margin. Morgans estimated it fell about 14 basis points in the quarter, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) estimated it was in the ""low 1.90s"", down from 2.04% in June. 
All three of CBA's ""Big Four"" peers - National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY),  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - have said in recent weeks that intense competition would continue to put pressure on margins. The trio's shares fell on Wednesday by between 1.3% and 1.9%.
""Today's trading update highlights that even CBA's strong franchise is not immune from the elevated margin pressures that appears to be particularly impacting the retail banks,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banking analyst Andrew Lyons said in a client note. 
CBA's cash profit for the three months ending Sept. 30 rose to A$2.20 billion ($1.60 billion) from A$1.80 billion reported last year.
Home loan sales volumes rose 7% over the year, equivalent to 1.2 times growth in the overall banking system amid continuing demand for fixed-rate loans. 
Business lending increased 13% in the same period, driven by improving confidence as the economy's pathway to a full recovery emerged. That compares with system business credit growth to September growing by 4.6%. 

Hugh Dive, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Funds Management Chief Investment Officer, said the share price fall was an ""over-reaction by the market, both because the pressure-on-NIMs story is not a surprise, and because this is only an unaudited quarterly update, which tends to come with a lot of noise. I'm really not tearing my hair out.""

U.S. Treasuries continued their downward trend, but the benchmark 10-year yield held above 1.6% and an auction of 20-year notes will take place later in the day.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the government is at risk of default unless lawmakers lift the legal debt ceiling by Dec. 15, and yields on Treasury bills maturing at the end of 2021 rose.
Although corporate profits have seemingly been minimally impacted by rising inflation, the question remains on whether this rise will be temporary or a more long-lasting phenomenon requiring central banks to respond with sharper monetary policies.
“Going into the end of 2021, we feel like the equity markets should remain strong,” UBS Global Wealth Management managing director Xi Qiao told Bloomberg. However, “we expect more volatility ahead with rising rates” and that inflation and COVID-19 concerns continue to stir anxiety, she added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday said it had closed an investigation into a fatal August 2020 Tesla (O:TSLA) crash in Saratoga, California, without taking any action.
The NTSB said the driver was operating a 2019 Tesla Model 3 with the driver assistance system Autopilot engaged but was manually pressing the accelerator pedal causing the vehicle to go into override mode when it struck the rear of a minivan.
The Tesla then struck a truck at approximately 110 miles per hour and caught fire, resulting in fatal injuries to the Tesla driver and his wife, who was also in the car.
The Tesla had issued multiple visual and audible 
alerts to the 75-year-old driver because his hands were not detected on the steering wheel while using Autopilot.
The Tesla was going at about 68 miles per hour behind the minivan when the driver increased the vehicle speed to 72 mph and the Model 3 triggered Automatic Emergency Braking, which dropped the speed.

The driver increased pressure on the accelerator to 95%, struck the minivan and then exited the highway traveling at speeds recorded up to 114 mph before striking the pickup. 
NTSB said the ""investigation was initiated to support the NTSB’s interest in automated vehicle performance"" but after the probe said ""no further action beyond this memorandum will be taken.""

(Reuters) - Some employees at video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) staged a walkout on Tuesday after a Wall Street Journal report that the company's chief executive knew about allegations of sexual harassment and assault earlier than previously known.
Activision Blizzard's board responded to the report with a statement saying directors had confidence in CEO Bobby Kotick. A spokesperson for the Santa Monica, California-based company said the article was inaccurate and misleading.
On Tuesday, the Journal said Kotick was aware of allegations that an employee had been raped by her supervisor and that he failed to inform the board.
Following publication of the article, a group describing themselves as representing Activision Blizzard employees demanded new leadership.
""We will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO,"" the ABK Workers Alliance wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We are staging a Walkout today.""
One employee told Reuters about 100 workers had gathered at a demonstration outside Blizzard's offices. 
A company spokesperson did not comment on the size of the demonstration but said Activision Blizzard supports employees' ""right to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation.” 
Shares of Activision were down 5.6% in late trade.

In recent months, Activision Blizzard has been embroiled in allegations of equal pay violations, sexual discrimination and sexual misconduct. Last month, the company said it had fired more than 20 employees following allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.
The board said it was confident in Kotick's leadership and that he acted appropriately when workplace issues were brought to his attention. Under Kotick, changes included ""a zero tolerance harassment policy"" efforts to increase the percentages of women and non-binary people in the workforce and ""investments to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent,"" the board said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Backers of a measure that asks Massachusetts voters to treat drivers for app-based companies like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) as independent contractors rather than employees said on Tuesday they had gathered enough signatures to get it on the ballot.
Supporters said roughly 130,000 signatures have been submitted to town and city clerks for each version of a ballot question backed by a coalition of app-based service providers in the closely watched fight over gig workers' legal rights.
The Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, whose members include Uber, Lyft, DoorDash Inc and Instacart Inc, in August proposed asking voters to declare their drivers independent contractors entitled to minimum benefits but not their employees.
The signatures were gathered by Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, a committee associated with the group. The ballot question's two versions are similar, though one lacks a safety training requirement in case opponents challenge it.
Signatures for 2022 ballot questions must be submitted by Wednesday for certification. At least 80,239 certified signatures must be delivered to the secretary of state by Dec. 1.
The proposal would establish an earnings floor equal to 120% of the Massachusetts minimum wage for app-based ride-share and delivery drivers, or $18 an hour in 2023, before tips. Drivers would be guaranteed at least 26 cents per mile to cover vehicle upkeep and gas.
Ride-share and delivery network companies would be required to pay healthcare stipends if drivers work at least 15 hours per week. Drivers could also earn paid sick time and paid family and medical leave.

The proposal follows a similar 2020 measure in California, where the companies persuaded state voters to solidify ride-hail and food delivery workers' status as independent contractors with some benefits.
A California judge, however, on Aug. 23 ruled that the measure, Proposition 22, violated the state's constitution.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday it is in direct talks with the telecom industry about its aviation safety concerns involving the planned use of spectrum for 5G wireless communications.
""We are having very productive discussions and we will figure this out,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said at an event in Washington. ""It remains to be seen what mitigations - whether it's adjustments to deployment or actions that we need to take within the aviation sector - what those will look like.""
Earlier this month, AT&T (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed to delay the commercial launch of C-band wireless service from Dec. 5 until early January.
The FAA issued a Nov. 2 bulletin alerting manufacturers, operators and pilots that action may be needed to address potential interference caused by the 5G deployment with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters.
The FAA bulletin said operators ""should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction.""
Wireless trade group CTIA said in a letter to the White House that in nearly 40 other countries, ""C-Band 5G spectrum is deployed and planes land safely every day without any evidence of harmful interference."" 
CTIA asked the Biden administration to ""reject further calls to delay C-Band 5G services. Aviation safety is critically important. It is also not at risk due to C-Band 5G operations.""
The FAA is considering issuing an airworthiness directive. Dickson said airlines need at least 30 days' notice.

""The industry needs some time to make adjustments to whatever requirements we're going to levy on them,"" he said. ""If they have to change their flight planning systems or how they are getting information to pilots... Whatever it is, we've got to give time to put all those things in place.""
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), U.S. airlines, pilots and others have urged the administration ""to help aviation and telecommunication industries reach acceptable mitigations."" They added that it ""will take significant time... to ensure they meet the FAA’s robust safety requirements.""

The agency said it does not plan to hold a meeting of the outside experts on Pfizer's request, concluding the request does not raise questions that would benefit from additional discussion by the members of the committee. 
The decision from the FDA will likely come before a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory panel meets on Friday to discuss expanding the eligibility for booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine, currently allowed for select groups of people.
Earlier this month, Pfizer had requested the FDA to authorize booster doses of the vaccine in all adults, presenting recent data showing the shot would help prevent disease across ages.
The company's third dose has been authorized for immunocompromised individuals, people aged 65 and above, all those at high risk of severe disease, and people who are regularly exposed to the virus.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in August announced plans to roll out booster doses for all adults in September.
The CDC sets U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Trian Fund Management LP has proposed shaking up the board at asset management firm Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) where the activist investment firm now owns a 15.43% stake, according to a regulatory filing made on Tuesday.
Trian, run by Nelson Peltz, Edward Garden and Peter May, said in the filing that it is speaking with the board and management about strategic and operational changes that could help boost the share price.
""As part of those discussions, the Reporting Persons have proposed changes to the composition of the Board, including the addition of independent directors unaffiliated with the Reporting Persons,"" the filing said.
Representatives for Trian and Janus Henderson were not immediately available to comment.
Trian has long pushed for more consolidation in the asset management industry and unveiled a roughly 10% stake in Janus Henderson as well as a roughly 10% stake in asset manager Invesco a year ago. Since then, Trian has raised its stake in Janus Henderson and said it bought more shares between Oct. 5, 2021 and Nov. 16, 2021 to reach its current 15.43% stake.
Janus Henderson was itself part of a wave of asset management industry consolidation when it was created in 2017 through a merger of Janus Capital and Henderson Global Investors. The company has a 10-member board.

Janus Henderson oversees $419 billion in assets compared with the roughly $10 trillion in assets overseen by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), one of the industry's biggest asset managers. Its stock price has climbed 70% in the last 12 months and closed at $46.30 on Tuesday.
Trian previously owned a stake in asset manager  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) where Peltz served on the board before the company was acquired by rival Franklin Templeton. Trian is known to push for operational changes at its targets, including mergers or sales, but it often tries to engage with management out of the limelight.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday as earnings from  Home Depot  and retail sales data signaled solid consumer health and eased worries about a Federal Reserve that may have to become more aggressive in the face of rising inflation.
Data showed retail sales jumped 1.7% in October, the largest gain since March and above the 1.4% estimate, indicating Americans have begun holiday shopping early in an effort to avoid a shortage of goods amid stretched supply chains.
Retailer Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) jumped 5.73% to close at a record high and had its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 2020 after beating quarterly sales estimates by nearly $2 billion and handily topping the earnings per share view.
""This does give people a sigh of relief that the retail outlook is still pretty rosy,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. 
""The outlook is one where prices are rising but consumer spending is still strong and it looks like the supply chains are stressed but still we’re able to get goods on the shelves."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 54.77 points, or 0.15%, to 36,142.22, the S&P 500 gained 18.1 points, or 0.39%, to 4,700.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 120.01 points, or 0.76%, to 15,973.86.
The S&P consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.38% and was the best-performing of the 11 major S&P sectors while the S&P 500 retailing index rose 1.24% to close at a record high for a second straight session.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the country's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, raised its annual sales and profit forecasts. Its shares gave up early gains, however, and fell 2.55%, their biggest daily percentage decline since May, as supply-chain woes dented margins and weighed on the consumer staples sector. 
Retailers  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS) are set to report earnings this week. 
Other data on the day showed U.S. manufacturing output surged to a two-and-a-half-year high in October.
The positive data helped investors look past comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who called for a more hawkish stance by the central bank in response to rising inflation. 
In contrast, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly on Tuesday called for central bank patience in the face of high inflation which, she predicted, will likely fade on its own as the pandemic recedes.
Investors have also been eyeing the possibility that President Joe Biden may pick a new head of the Federal Reserve as Chair Jerome Powell's term is set to end in February 2022, with Biden saying on Tuesday afternoon he will make a final decision in about four days.
Technology shares also moved higher, up 1.07%, lifted in part by a 7.89% gain in chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, which rose after it said German automaker BMW will use its chips in its next generation of driver-assistance and self-driving systems.
Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc posted its first advance in four sessions, even as CEO Elon Musk sold $930 million in shares. The stock had tumbled more than 15% last week after Musk began selling shares.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) also sued Tesla for $162.2 million over a breach of contract related to stock warrants.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 80 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 152 new highs and 189 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.53 billion shares, compared with the 11.02 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Google said issues with its Cloud Networking, which counts Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Spotify and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) as clients, were partially resolved shortly after thousands of users flagged it on outage tracking website downdetector.com.
Google Cloud's dashboard earlier showed that services including cloud developer tools, cloud console and cloud engine were facing disruptions. 
Spotify had said it was aware of ""some issues right now and are checking them"" after more than 50,000 users reported issues on downdetector, but those disruptions have since been resolved, according to the website.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Tuesday it is seeking U.S. authorization of its experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill that cut the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89% in a clinical trial.
Pfizer said it completed submission of its application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of the drug, Paxlovid, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including data from the drugmaker's clinical trial.
The oral drug could be a promising new weapon in the fight against the pandemic, as it can be taken as an early at-home treatment to help prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. It could also become a important tool in countries and areas with limited access to vaccines or low vaccination rates.
It is not immediately clear when U.S. regulators will rule on Pfizer's application. Merck & Co and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which are developing a competing pill, molnupiravir, completed their EUA submission on Oct. 11.
A panel of outside advisers to the FDA will meet to consider that application on Nov. 30. It is expected to be available this year. 
""We are moving as quickly as possible in our effort to get this potential treatment into the hands of patients, and we look forward to working with the U.S. FDA on its review of our application, along with other regulatory agencies around the world,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a news release.
A Pfizer spokesperson said that the data the company is submitting came from testing the medicine on unvaccinated, high-risk participants. The FDA will make the final decision on who the drug will be indicated for and how it can be used.
The New York-based drugmaker said it has begun the process of seeking authorization of the treatment in several countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, and plans further international submissions.

Pfizer has said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of next month and at least 50 million courses by the end of 2022.
The company earlier on Tuesday said it will allow generic manufacturers to supply its COVID-19 pill to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP).

(Reuters) -Walmart Inc shares on Tuesday suffered their biggest intraday drop since May after high labor and supply chain costs ate into quarterly margins, even as the world's biggest retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecast.
Major retailers, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), have been struggling to bring products into the United States ahead of the peak shopping season due to shipping logjams, shuttered factories in parts of Asia and a scarcity of raw materials in recent months.
The hit to Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s margins comes despite efforts by the retailer to limit disruption from supply chain shortages by chartering its own vessels to ship goods, ordering products into the United States well ahead of time and re-routing deliveries to less crowded ports. 
Shares in Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart declined 2.5% after the company said gross margins for the third quarter declined 42 basis points (bps). The period includes October, when some consumers began early shopping for the all-important holidays. Walmart's tight margins could continue into the rest of the festive season, analysts said.
Supply chain issues or inflation could see Walmart down 10-30 basis points on its fourth-quarter gross margin rate in the United States, said Evercore's Greg Melich.
""The long period of sustained demand for goods has stretched supply chains, resulting in out of stocks and inflation,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said.
Walmart's results come weeks after rival ecommerce giant Amazon https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazons-holiday-quarter-forecast-disappoints-labor-supply-issues-mount-2021-10-28 reported an underwhelming fourth-quarter outlook and warned of higher costs during the holiday period.
Inflation and a labor shortage have rippled through America, forcing retailers to raise wages and hand out hefty bonuses. Walmart's McMillon said the retailer had hired over 200,000 new store and supply chain workers to tackle the holiday rush.
""They have a huge labor base and that pressured margins,"" Randy Hare, director of equity research at Huntington Private Bank, a Walmart investor. ""If we start to see labor rates move up because of inflation, Walmart's one of the ones we wouldn't want to be around.""
Walmart kept prices low to draw shoppers into stores in the third quarter. With more than 5,000 U.S. stores, the discounter's size and leverage with consumer product companies allow it to sell goods at lower prices, a key advantage when U.S. inflation is at a 30-year high. 
HOLIDAY RUSH
Increased contributions from its advertising business helped offset some of the supply-chain pressure on margins, the company said. Retailers are aggressively chasing consumer brands' ad dollars, touting the wealth of their shopper data and prime media space on their websites and in stores.
Walmart said it expects full-year U.S. same-store sales to be more than 6% higher versus its prior forecast of a 5% to 6% rise, in anticipation of a surge in demand for toys and apparel during the holidays. Adjusted profit is expected to be around $6.40 per share, up from a previous range of $6.20 to $6.35.
In the third quarter, sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 9.2%, excluding fuel, benefiting from higher grocery demand and people buying more at stores. Analysts had estimated a gain of 7.04%, according to Refinitiv data.

Walmart's international business grew about 10% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and divestitures, benefiting from strong sales in China and at India's Flipkart that got a big push from its promotional event ahead of the local festival of Diwali.
Total revenue grew by a better-than-expected 4.3% to $140.53 billion and on an adjusted basis it earned $1.45 per share, 5 cents above Wall Street expectations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global equities jumped higher on Tuesday on the back of optimism about consumer resilience in the face of rising inflation, which also helped drive the dollar to a 16-month high.
All three major Wall Street indices moved higher in midday trading, as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) upped its holiday forecast and the Commerce Department reported October retail sales activity that beat economist expectations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.61%, the S&P 500 gained 0.58%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 0.25%.
The strong data and boosted forecast suggested Americans so far at least are not discouraged from spending by rising prices, buoying hopes for a strong recovery as the world's largest economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. It also suggests the Federal Reserve might less worried about derailing the recovery with quicker interest rate hikes.
""If the U.S. economy is going to recover, it's going to be partly through consumption, which is still about 70% of the economy,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Today's retail sales number supports that.""
Economic optimism paired with continued inflation also helped continue to push the U.S. dollar higher. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was last up 0.48%.
The dollar index has rallied since U.S. inflation data last week showed annualized consumer prices jumping surged to their highest since 1990, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates sooner than expected.
The Fed should ""tack in a more hawkish direction"" to prepare in case inflation does not begin to ease, St. Louis Federal Reserve bank president James Bullard said.
Treasury yields also moved up on Tuesday's developments. Benchmark 10-year notes were last at 1.63%, up from 1.61% before the data was released.
The retail data added to a more buoyant mood after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held more than three hours of virtual talks Monday. 
The conversation between the leaders of the world's biggest economies appeared to yield no immediate outcome but is widely seen as a joint effort to improve icy relations and avoid direct confrontation. 

Oil prices also moved upward in Tuesday's trading. Brent crude for delivery was last up 0.8% to $82.68 a barrel. U.S. crude was last up 0.3% to $81.14 per barrel. Oil prices have come under pressure from the prospect high energy prices could drive increased production and lead to an oil supply surplus.
Market optimism elsewhere weighed down safe-haven gold, as spot gold prices fell 0.60% to $1,851.32 an ounce.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Tuesday said it was resuming shared rides, which were scrapped during the pandemic, detailing a revamped offer aimed at reducing the previously high losses in the pooled rides segment.
Uber said the new shared rides option, which allows strangers to split a car traveling in the same direction, started piloting in Miami on Tuesday, with no firm plans yet for a U.S. expansion.
Previous known as Uber Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), the new UberX Share offers a 5% upfront discount compared to a regular ride, Uber said on its website. That is a more modest price reduction than Uber Pool rides, which in the past offered rides at as much as half the fare of a private ride.
Passengers booking a shared ride can now earn additional discounts in Uber credit, not cash, if another rider joins their trip. They receive a minimum of $2 and up to 30% of the price in Uber credit if a co-rider joins.
Previously, passengers paid a pool rate regardless of whether they ended up sharing the ride. This allowed many passengers to book a discounted ride without ever having to actually share the trip. Chicago city data showed that some 25% to 40% of all requested shared trips did not end up being shared pre-pandemic.
Shared rides only made up a small percentage of pre-pandemic rides and Uber in the past said it was losing ""significant sums"" due to heavy shared ride discounts.

Smaller U.S. rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) in July resumed its shared rides offer.
Both companies halted the option in March 2020 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus and both require drivers and customers to wear masks. They also limit shared rides to a total of two passengers who are requested to sit in the backseat.

(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it will allow generic manufacturers to supply its experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP).
The voluntary licensing agreement between  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and the MPP will allow the UN-backed group to grant sub-licences to qualified generic drug manufacturers to make their own versions of PF-07321332. Pfizer will sell the pills it manufactures under the brand name Paxlovid.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said it was ""disheartened"" by the deal which it said was restrictive and excluded countries such as Argentina and China with established capacity for producing generic drugs.
""The world knows by now that access to COVID-19 medical tools needs to be guaranteed for everyone, everywhere, if we really want to control this pandemic,"" said Yuanqiong Hu, MSF Senior Legal Policy Adviser.
Pfizer, which also makes one of the mostly widely used COVID-19 vaccines, has said the pill cut the chance of hospitalisation or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89% in its clinical trial. The drug will be used in combination with ritonavir, an HIV drug that is already available generically. 
Pfizer's licensing deal follows a similar arrangement by rival Merck & Co for generic manufacturing of its COVID-19 treatment. The deals are unusual arrangements that acknowledge the dire need for effective treatments as well as the pressure drugmakers are under to make their life-saving drugs accessible at very low costs. 
""We are extremely pleased to have another weapon in our armoury to protect people from the ravages of COVID-19,"" Charles Gore, Executive Director of the Medicines Patent Pool, said in an interview.
Gore said he hoped the generic version of Pfizer's drug would be available within months.
The 95 countries in the agreement cover around 53% of the world's population and include all low- and lower-middle-income countries and some upper-middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also include countries that have transitioned from lower-middle to upper-middle-income status in the past five years, Pfizer and the MPP said.
""We must work to ensure that all people – regardless of where they live or their circumstances – have access to these breakthroughs,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Pfizer will waive royalties on sales in low-income countries. It will also waive them in the other countries covered by the agreement as long as COVID-19 remains classified as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. 
Pfizer's version of the drug will be in high demand. The company has said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of next month and at least 50 million courses by the end of 2022.
Even so, the drugmaker could be stretched trying to supply 47% of the world's population. A Pfizer executive said last week the market for the drug might be up to 150 million people and that many countries might also be interested in buying doses for their strategic reserves. 

Pfizer has said it will sell the supply it produces using a tiered pricing approach based on the income level of each country. In the United States, it expects to price its treatment close to where Merck has priced its drug at around $700 a course.
Merck has licence agreements for it COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir, in over 100 countries. Still, some international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>","Qualcomm forecasts post-Apple sales growth, shares hit all-time high","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -Qualcomm Inc said on Tuesday it expects chip sales to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to dwindle to a trickle in the coming years but predicted brisk growth in chips for autonomous cars and other connected devices, sending shares up 7.9% to a record high close of $181.81.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) currently supplies all of the modem chips that connect Apple's devices to mobile data networks, but Apple is working on its own modem chips.
At an investor conference in New York, Qualcomm executives said they expect to supply only 20% of Apple's modem chips by the launch of the iPhone in 2023. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala expects Apple to make up a ""low single-digit"" percentage of the company's chip sales by the end of fiscal 2024. 
But Apple losses will be more than offset by gains in other fields, Qualcomm executives said. 
Qualcomm expects revenue from the automotive sector, where sales were just under $1 billion in fiscal 2021, to reach $3.5 billion in five years and $8 billion in 10 years. Earlier on Tuesday, Qualcomm landed a deal to sell self-driving car chips to German automaker BMW.
Qualcomm executives said that Apple had fostered a market for devices such as smart watches and premium wireless headphones.
While Apple self-supplies chips for those devices, Qualcomm said it aims to supply chips for everyone else. The company said it expects $9 billion in revenue from its internet of things unit that supplies such devices, an 80% increase from the $5 billion for the unit in fiscal 2021. Growth in that segment will also come from virtual reality headsets such as Meta Platforms Inc's Oculus Quest 2, which uses a Qualcomm chip and which has now sold 10 million units, executives said, referring to third-party estimates.
""We're no longer defined by a single end market and a single customer relationship,"" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said during the event.

Amon also said that Qualcomm sells Apple what are called radio-frequency front-end chips that are paired with modem chips. Amon said Qualcomm will have a future chance to compete to sell those chips to Apple regardless of where Apple sources its modem chips.
Qualcomm executives said those potential wins are not included in Qualcomm's forecasts and that they expect phone chip revenue to grow in line with global markets thanks to strong demand from Android device makers.

Stein also filed a lawsuit against Juul Labs Inc founders James Monsees and Adam Bowen, seeking civil penalties and damages, alleging they personally participated in Juul's marketing strategy of attracting young users to their product.
The probe also takes aim at other companies that manufacture tobacco-free cigarettes and at retailers across the state that sell flavored e-cigarettes, including many located near schools.
Puff Bar, a brand of disposable e-cigarettes that are sold in various flavors including ""Blueberry Ice"", and Juul did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. 
Teenage use of e-cigarettes has surged in recent years, largely coinciding with a rise in Juul's popularity in 2017 and 2018, prompting a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ban on fruit and mint flavors in early 2020.

""The market Juul created still exists, and other companies are filling the vacuum,"" Stein said in a statement. Federal survey data from 2020 showed that the impact of a decline in Juul's popularity in 2019, was offset by increases in use of other brands.
Stein also urged FDA Commissioner Nominee Robert Califf to create national, industry-wide regulations on e-cigarette flavors.

Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
As the chart above shows, silver has been in a steep downtrend over the past year vs. the S&P-500 but recently found some support at a major support level. This is the same level where this ratio bottomed in late 2018. Since attempting to hammer out a bottom, the Silver/S&P-500 ratio has climbed back above its short-term moving average (red line), a positive sign suggesting a potential change in momentum. If we look back over the past three decades, silver’s best performance has come when it’s only been leading the price of gold but also the S&P-500, and this recent shift in momentum is a positive development thus far. The key to confirming this, though, is for the Silver/S&P-500 ratio to move above its long-term trend line as well, which would require a dip in the S&P-500/Silver ratio to 170 or lower. This will be a level to monitor as we head into the back half of Q4.

 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) rallied more than 5%, to helping the broader retail sector advance after the home improvement retailer reported better-than-expected third-quarter results underpinned by higher prices.
Home Depot beat on both the top and bottom lines, with comparable U.S. store sales climbing 5.5% ahead of expectations for 0.9%. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) raised its full-year earnings guidance and reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, but its shares slipped 2%.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 04:07PM ET</span>","Analysis-Banks that helped GE, others bulk up now profit from break-ups","By Anirban Sen and David French
(Reuters) - Some of the Wall Street banks that helped  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) become massive conglomerates through acquisitions over the years are now profiting from their break-ups, a Reuters analysis showed.
The three companies, which in recent days announced plans to spin off divisions, doled out hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to banks, including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), to advise them on acquisitions over the years. Now, the same banks are getting paid to undo the outcomes of those deals. 
Spokespeople for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS did not respond to requests for comment.
While it's not uncommon for an investment bank to advise a company on a spin-off after previously working on the company's acquisitions, the spate of high-profile spin-offs by companies in recent days shines new light on the practice. 
Banks have so far earned over $1 billion on spin-offs globally so far this year, nearly twice what they earned in 2020, according to Refinitiv. 
Investors in those companies are not assured similar riches. Shares of companies that engage in acquisitions or divestments have had a mixed track record, often underperforming peers in the last two years, according to Refinitiv.
Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, said banks do not generally break any rules when working on these deals because they are carrying out their clients' wishes. But he noted that this did not absolve banks of the responsibility to advise against a deal they view as not in a company's long-term interest.
""If the bankers deserve criticism, it is for not pushing back against a CEO who pushes a bad deal,"" Gordon said.
In the case of GE, Goldman Sachs was one of the banks, alongside Evercore Inc, PJT Partners (NYSE:PJT) Inc and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), that stand to collect tens of millions of dollars from advising on the company's break-up, according to estimates from M&A lawyers and bankers. 
Goldman Sachs had previously collected nearly $400 million in fees advising the company on acquisitions, divestitures and spin-offs since 2000, making it GE's top adviser based on M&A fees collected, according to Refinitiv. 
JPMorgan, which advised J&J on its planned break-up, had previously made $206 million in fees since 2000 advising it on deals, according to Refinitiv. UBS, which worked on Toshiba's break-up, had collected $12 million in fees, the Refinitiv data showed.
Industrywide, Goldman Sachs has earned the most in fees from advising on corporate break-ups thus far in 2021, followed by JPMorgan and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd, according to Dealogic.
Corporate break-ups are on the rise amid a growing consensus on Wall Street that companies perform best only if they are focused on adjacent business areas, as well as increasing pressure from activist hedge funds pushing them in that direction. 
Some 42 spin-offs collectively worth over $200 billion have been announced globally so far this year, up from 38 spin-offs worth roughly $90 billion in 2020, according to Dealogic. Investment banks have collected more than $4.5 billion since 2011 advising on spin-off deals globally, the Dealogic data shows. 
Graphic: Top 5 corporate spinoffs over the past decade: https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-DEALS/lgpdwnxrgvo/chart.png 
INDEPENDENT ADVICE 
Investment bankers often argue that companies did not necessarily get it wrong when they embarked on deals they later reversed, because some combinations do not make sense forever.
Changes in a company's technological and competitive landscape or in the attitude of its shareholders can push it to change course.
For example, GE shareholders were initially supportive of its empire-building acquisitions in businesses as diverse as healthcare, credit cards and entertainment in the 1990s, viewing them as diversifying its earnings stream. When some of these businesses started to underperform and GE's valuation suffered, investors lost faith in the company's ability to run disparate businesses.
Bankers also argue that most companies want to pay bankers for delivering deals rather than advice on whether they need to do a deal in the first place. This creates incentives for bankers to try to clinch a transaction rather than encourage a better outcome for their client that may not involve a deal.

But it also offers ammunition to Wall Street critics who argue that companies cannot rely on banks for independent advice on whether they should pursue a deal.
""Companies should develop valuations in house and with help from unbiased third-party advisers, whether or not they also hire an investment bank,"" said Nuno Fernandes, professor of finance at IESE Business School.

FABI said the exits would be voluntary, giving employees the option to retire early, and the new hires would have a permanent contract.
""We took early action before the new business plan (by Intesa) where we think digitalisation will play an important role,"" FABI secretary general Giuseppe Milazzo said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Intesa said the exits and new recruits would be completed by the end of 2025.
Intesa merged with smaller rival UBI last year to create Italy's biggest bank by assets. Following the acquisition, Intesa in September 2020 announced it had agreed with unions at least 5,000 voluntary layoffs and up to 2,500 new hires. 
Taking into account the September 2020 agreement, a total of 9,200 people will have left the group by the first quarter of 2025 and 4,600 people will have been hired by December 2025, Intesa said.
""We have one of the biggest generational change programmes in Italy,"" Intesa's chief operating officer, Paola Angeletti, said.

After announcing earlier this month that it had met its 2021 profit goals ahead of target, Intesa said it would use the money in the year's final quarter to cover restructuring charges and loan loss provisions ahead of the new business plan.
Italian banks traditionally lay off people on a voluntary basis only, using a costly scheme that allows older workers to retire early and receive up to 90% of their salary until they qualify for pension.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge overseeing trade issues on Tuesday overturned a decision by then-President Donald Trump to allow a reimposition of tariffs on some imported solar panels.
The decision by Judge Gary Katzmann of the U.S. Court of International Trade is a defeat for some domestic manufacturers.
It came one year after he ruled that Trump's October 2020 proclamation to revoke a tariff exemption for double-sided, or bifacial, solar panels had not violated an earlier court order.
Trump's proclamation was a ""clear misconstruction"" of a law that permits measures to liberalize rather than restrict trade, and ""constituted an action outside the President's delegated authority,"" Katzmann wrote on Tuesday.
Shares of  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR), a large U.S. solar panel manufacturer, fell after the decision and were down 7.1% in late afternoon trading.
The Biden administration had defended Trump, saying he acted lawfully to close a ""loophole"" that he believed was undermining tariff protections against an ""explosive"" increase in imports.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bifacial technology is a small but growing part of the solar panel market, costing more but capable of producing greater power than traditional panels.
Trump had said extending the exemption would likely reduce the effectiveness of tariffs meant to help shield the domestic solar industry against growing imports.
But a trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, contended that higher tariffs could wipe out a few billion dollars of domestic investment a year.
The group and some solar farms sued last December over the proclamation, saying Trump acted without going through required procedures.
Abigail Ross Hopper, the group's president, in a statement called Trump's proclamation ""an unlawful attempt to harshen"" tariffs and Katzmann's findings ""clearly the right conclusion.""

The United States in 2018 imposed four years of duties on solar panel imports, starting at 30% and declining to 15% in the final year. Trump's proclamation boosted the latter rate to 18%.
The case is Solar Energy Industries Association et al v U.S. et al, U.S. Court of International Trade, No. 20-03941.

Prosecutors had investigated allegations that Vivendi's billionaire owner Vincent Bollore and CEO Arnaud De Puyfontaine used the prospect - and then collapse - of a deal to buy Mediaset's pay TV arm to drive down the Italian firm's shares and buy them on the cheap in 2016.
Vivendi denied any wrongdoing in a statement after prosecutors wrapped up their probe in December 2020. 
Requests from prosecutors to drop cases in Italy tend to be because they do not think they can support a prosecution in court. 
Vivendi's decision to back out of the pay TV deal prompted broadcaster Mediaset and its controlling shareholder Fininvest to seek multibillion-euro damages, triggering a five-year legal war that ended earlier this year with a settlement. 
Fininvest is the holding company of the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 

The judicial source said the request to dismiss the case was filed last week. It will now be up to a judge to decide whether to grant it.
Vivendi, Mediaset and Fininvest declined to comment.

Do read on for an explanation.Although impressive third-quarter earnings, an improved job market, and rising consumer spending helped benchmark equity indexes hit fresh highs last month, historically-high inflation rates and the Federal Reserve’s decision to begin tapering its bond-buying later this month have been fostering market volatility of late.
Since real estate investment trusts (REITs) must distribute most of their income as dividends, they are coveted for the steady income stream they provide when the market is volatile. Also, they offer a cushion to one’s portfolio during an inflationary period. Investors’ interest in this space is evident in the ALPS Active REIT ETF’s (REIT) 14.3% returns over the past six months, versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 12.2% gains.

And with Congresses' passage of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, silver is expected to benefit due to its significant industrial usage. Therefore, we think silver ETFs iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), Global X Silver Miners (SIL), and Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver (SIVR) could be solid bets now. Read on.Last week, silver prices climbed above $25.00 per ounce—a new three-month high—after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the Consumer Price Index for October expanded by 6.2% year over year, its largest increased since 1990. After a short correction on Monday, the white metal climbed today to around $25.25 per ounce.
The metal has recovered strongly after hitting its $21.40 per ounce year-to-date low in September. Furthermore, the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill is expected to boost the silver market due to the white metal’s usage in electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, fuel cells, and plug-in charging stations, among other industrial uses. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects silver prices to hit $33 an ounce.
Given this backdrop, we think silver ETFs iShares Silver Trust (SLV), Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL), and Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF (SIVR) could be solid bets now.

Investing.com -- Strong results from large retailers and data on sales in October lifted stocks on Tuesday, kicking off a big week of earnings for the sector.
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) forecast a strong holiday season and the largest brick-and-mortar retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecasts.  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) beat quarterly same-store sales estimates.
 Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is due to report Wednesday and Macys and other retailers later in the week.
Data showed retail sales rose in October as Americans appeared to have started holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid supply chain concerns, giving the economy a lift at the start of the fourth quarter, Reuters reported.
Other data showed that manufacturing output in the U.S. rose to a two and a half year high in October, lifting shares of Industrial companies.
The bullish news on the retail sector -- consumer spending drives two-thirds of the U.S. economy -- blunted comments by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who called for a more hawkish approach to rising inflation.
President Joe Biden took to the road on Tuesday to try and repair his sinking approval numbers after signing the $1 trillion infrastructure package into law at a White House ceremony on Monday. The new law will unleash hundreds of billions of dollars to improve roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Target earnings
Target’s third-quarter revenue is seen coming in at $24.54 billion and profit per share at $2.81, according to analysts at Investing.com.
2. Nvidia earnings
Chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to report a profit per share of $1.11 on third-quarter revenue of $6.82 billion.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 03:27PM ET</span>",JPMorgan sues Tesla for $162 million after Musk tweets soured warrant deal,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co has sued Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for $162.2 million, accusing Elon Musk's electric car company of ""flagrantly"" breaching a contract the two corporate giants agreed in 2014 relating to warrants Tesla sold to the bank. 
Warrants give the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a set ""strike"" price and date. The suit, filed in a Manhattan federal court, centers on a dispute over how JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) re-priced its Tesla warrants as a result of Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he was considering taking the carmaker private. 
It is unusual for a major Wall Street bank to sue such a high-profile client, although JPMorgan has done relatively little business with the electric carmaker over the past seven years, according to Tesla's filings and Refinitiv data. 
""We have provided Tesla multiple opportunities to fulfill its contractual obligations, so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation,"" a spokesperson for JPMorgan said in a statement.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the complaint, Tesla in 2014 sold warrants to JPMorgan that would pay off if their ""strike"" price was below Tesla's share price when the warrants expired in June and July 2021.
JPMorgan said the warrants contained standard provisions that allowed it to adjust their price to protect both parties against the economic effects of ""significant corporate transactions involving Tesla,"" such as an announcement the company was going private. 
Musk's Aug. 7, 2018 tweet that he might take Tesla private at $420 per share and had ""funding secured,"" and his subsequent announcement 17 days later that he was abandoning the plan, created significant volatility in the share price, the bank said. On both occasions, JPMorgan adjusted the strike price ""to maintain the same fair market value"" as prior to the tweets.
Tesla's share price rose approximately 10-fold by the time the warrants expired this year, and JPMorgan said this required Tesla under its contract to hand over shares of its stock or cash. The bank said Tesla's failure to do that amounted to a default.
""Though JPMorgan's adjustments were appropriate and contractually required,"" the complaint said, ""Tesla has flagrantly ignored its clear contractual obligation to pay JPMorgan in full,"" the bank said. 

Tesla in February 2019 complained that the bank's adjustments were ""an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in Tesla's stock,"" but did not challenge the underlying calculations, JPMorgan said.
Musk's tweets resulted in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission bringing civil charges and $20 million fines against both him and Tesla.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 jumped Tuesday to near record highs, led by retailers following a rally in  Home Depot  and optimism on the economy after data showed consumer spending remained buoyant.
The S&P 500 rose 0.53% to 4,707.90, just shy of its all time high of 4,718.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.27%, or 133 points, the Nasdaq added 0.76%.
Home Depot (NYSE:HD) rallied more than 5%, to helping the broader retail sector advance after the home improvement retailer reported better-than-expected third-quarter results underpinned by higher prices.
Home Depot beat on both the top and bottom lines, with comparable U.S. store sales climbing 5.5% ahead of expectations for 0.9%. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) raised its full-year earnings guidance and reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, but its shares slipped 2%. 
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) were both in the green ahead of their quarterly results due Wednesday. 
Sentiment on the retail stocks were also supported by signs the consumers continue to spend even as inflation runs hot. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that retail sales rose 1.7% last month,economists estimates for a 1.4% rise.  The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  climbed 1.6% ahead of expectations for a 0.9% rise. 
“Despite soaring prices and deteriorating consumer sentiment, there is absolutely no evidence of consumers pulling back,” Jefferies said in a note.
Tech also supported by broader market as chip-stocks including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) racked up gains.
Qualcomm jumped more than 3% after winning a new deal to supply its Snapdragon chips to BMW for the automaker’s automated driving systems.
Energy was also among the top sectors on the day as oil prices resumed their climb higher despite growing concerns that fresh Covid-19 restrictions in Europe could dampen oil demand. 
Energy is up about 54% year to date, but some on Wall Street suggest that it may be time to take profit on the sector. 
“While the energy sector could continue to perform well in 2022, we believe it is prudent to take profits…,” Wells Fargo said in a note on Monday. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose more than 2% shrugging off reports JPMorgan had sued the electric automaker, seeking a $162 million payment for warrants that expired above their strike price following wild moves in the company's stock price after founder Elon Musk's tweet in 2018 threatening to take the EV company private.
Elsewhere in the EV sector, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) confirmed its 2022 production guidance, and reported more than 17,000 reservations for its debut electric vehicle following 13,000 reservations in the prior quarter. Its shares jumped 22%.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>","As U.S. Congress advances Democrats' tax plans, America's wealthy eye loopholes","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -As Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives look to advance https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-eyes-us-house-vote-spending-bill-next-week-deese-2021-11-08 their $1.75 trillion social spending package this week, wealthy individuals are already planning ways to avoid paying for it. 
The package would be the biggest expansion of the U.S. safety net since the 1960s, and Democrats propose paying for it by levying a 5% surtax on individuals with more than $10 million in annual income and an additional 3% tax on individuals with more than $25 million in annual income. 
The White House says the new surtax could generate $230 billion to pay for the spending bill, but experts and bankers say that many individuals will find ways to avoid it and that it will raise less than an earlier proposal for a billionaires tax. 
""Even though on paper the bill looks like it increases sharply the taxes on ultra-millionaires, in reality it's not going to have as much bite,"" said Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
The proposed billionaires tax https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrat-unveils-billionaires-tax-biden-agenda-2021-10-27, targeting fewer than 800 people, commanded headlines in recent weeks and prompted the world's richest man, Elon Musk, to sell https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-5-billion-tesla-stock-haul-has-charity-circuit-buzzing-2021-11-12 $6.9 billion in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc stock last week.
That proposal taxed unrealized share gains, but it was ditched after moderate Democrats opposed the plan, arguing it unfairly targeted wealth creators. 
The exact details of the bill that the House will vote on are not yet known. Bankers, lawyers and academics expect it to include the White House's proposal for the up-to-8% surtax, but not the billionaires tax.
The surtax is straightforward for wealthy taxpayers to plan around, said Alvina Lo, chief wealth strategist at Wilmington Trust. 
""The goal is to get your modified adjusted gross income below the threshold and the tax does not apply,"" Lo said.
The billionaires tax, in contrast, ""would have been very difficult to avoid,"" said Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank's national director of wealth planning, Lisa Featherngill. 
That levy would have applied to individuals with assets worth more than $1 billion or who earned more than $100 million for three years straight. To avoid paying the tax, individuals would have had to reduce their income or assets by at least half.
""If you have a billion in assets, getting to $500 million is not easy,"" Featherngill said.
U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, author of the proposed billionaires tax, told reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday that he was still hopeful Democrats may yet adopt the levy to pay for expanding social programs and climate change initiatives.
Citing reporting by Reuters, he said: ""There are economic experts saying that if you want to make sure you raise the revenue, go with the billionaires income tax.""
S CORPS AND C CORPS
Some wealthy people are looking to bring their personal income below the $10 million threshold for 2022 by shifting earnings they receive through so-called S corporations or pass through tax structures to C corporations.
S corporations are popular with Wall Street investors and owners of private equity firms and hedge funds. That is because the structure allows them to declare their earnings from the business as personal income - avoiding the additional layer of corporate income tax.
In the proposed bill, S corps are taxed at a top rate of 48.8% at the federal level, and at over a 60% rate in California and New York when adding state income taxes.
By switching their S corporation tax structures to a C corporation, wealthy individuals should be able to keep their annual personal income below the $10 million threshold – although the downside is those earnings must be retained in the business, where they will pay a corporate tax of 21%.
STOCK SALES 
Wealthy individuals are also selling stock this year before the surtax takes effect and planning to spread out future stock sales over several years to avoid hitting the $10 million-surtax threshold, bankers say. 
Individuals will still pay capital gains and investment income taxes totaling up to 23.8%, but that is less than the 31.8% tax the highest income earners could pay next year overall if the spending bill is passed, Lo said.
It is not clear if Democratic lawmakers are aware of the potential loopholes.

Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said the tax surcharge was a ""big improvement,"" but not enough.
""The millionaires surtax does not fix the problem of unrealized capital gains,"" he said. ""The billionaires income tax, on the other hand, would solve the scandal of tax-free billionaires.""

Earlier this month, Pfizer, which also makes one of the mostly widely used COVID-19 vaccines, said the pill https://reut.rs/3oxaxnz cut the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89% in its clinical trial. 
Pfizer expects to submit interim trial results for the pill, branded Paxlovid, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the Nov. 25 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
The pill will compete with Merck & Co Inc's similar oral drug, molnupiravir, which was shown to halve the chances of dying or hospitalization for COVID-19 patients at high risk of serious illness. Merck applied for U.S. emergency use authorization for its drug in October and has already received regulatory clearance in Britain.

The price struck between the administration and Pfizer for its drug is less than that for the Merck pill, closer to $500 per treatment, the report said, adding that the final details have not been chalked out.

(Reuters) -Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said that German automaker BMW will use its chips in its next generation of driver-assistance and self-driving systems.
San Diego-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the world's biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones but has been diversifying its business, with more than a third of its chip sales coming from sources other than makers of handsets. 
Qualcomm's announcement of the BMW win came before an investor presentation where it detailed how the company is working with firms like Meta Platforms Inc on virtual reality hardware and with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Windows laptops that use Qualcomm chips. 
Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said he believes the addressable market for the firm's technologies is now $700 billion, seven times higher than the phone chip industry alone.
""We've never had so many end-market opportunities for Qualcomm as we have today,"" Amon said.
A spokesperson for BMW said the new chips would be used for its ""Neue Klasse"" series of cars, set to start production from 2025.
Automotive chips are a key growth area for Qualcomm, which supplies chips for infotainment system instrument panels to companies such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
It has also been working to challenge its chip industry rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) in supplying chips that power driver-assistance computers for tasks such as automated lane-keeping and eventual self-driving systems.
Qualcomm and BMW will use a dedicated Qualcomm computer vision processing chip to analyze data from front, rear and surround-view cameras. BMW will also use a Qualcomm central computing chip and another set of Qualcomm chips to help the car communicate with cloud computing data centers.
An existing partnership between BMW and Intel's Mobileye (F:0ME) self-driving technology unit would continue, BMW said, although plans to release an autonomous vehicle in 2021 have not materialized.

A 7 Series full-size sedan featuring Intel's Level 3 autonomous driving technology, which enables cars to drive themselves under limited conditions but still require a driver, is due for release next year.
The two companies did not say how much of the BMW group's line-up the Qualcomm deal would cover.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Year-end bonuses for Wall Street staffers are set to be the highest since 2009 this year, with investment bankers and equities traders in line for the biggest bonuses, compensation firm Johnson Associates Inc said on Tuesday.
Overall, incentives at the end of this year, which include cash bonuses and equity awards, will be significantly higher compared with last year, when most professionals saw a decline in awards, the study shows.
The awards reflect record levels of deal-making and trading activity as government stimulus measures helped propel global stock markets to all-time highs. 
Bonuses for investment banking underwriters are projected to jump by as much as 35%, while investment banking advisers and equities sales and trading professionals can expect to see awards increase 20%-30%, according to the research.
""This year's bonus season on Wall Street should be one for the record books,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates. ""Virtually all financial services industry segments, including investment banking, asset management and alternative investments are performing at record levels. This, in turn, will translate into incentive award increases we haven't seen in the industry since before the Great Recession.""

Double-digit increases are projected for workers at private equity and asset management firms, hedge funds and those in management and staff positions. 
Retail and commercial banking workers, however, are projected to receive payments that will increase a more modest 5%, the study shows. Payments for fixed income sales professionals and traders are projected to be similar or slightly less compared with last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union won't suddenly pull up the ""drawbridge"" on Britain's financial services sector, and reducing reliance on the City of London for euro clearing could take years, a top European Commission official said on Tuesday.
The EU executive said last week that EU market participants could continue clearing euro denominated derivatives in London beyond June 2022, when permission was set to expire.
The extra period would allow time to expand the bloc's capacity in clearing, a core part of the financial system's plumbing which has become politicised due to Brexit given that the London Stock Exchange clears about 90% of euro denominated swaps.
""The City of London is a global financial centre we will always want to use because it is next door, it's convenient. The issue here is one of balance,"" John Berrigan, head of the commission's financial services unit, told an event held by Brussels think tank CEPS.
""That balance, we will have to work on in the next few years,"" Berrigan said.
Banks say that forcing a shift in euro derivatives clearing from the London Stock Exchange to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt would be costly and fragment markets.
Before deciding on the length of Britain's market access extension, the EU is waiting for a report from the bloc's markets watchdog ESMA, due in coming weeks. The ESMA report is expected to reach conclusions by year end on whether UK clearers are so systemic that EU business should be shifted to the bloc.
The commission will then see what measures might be required to move clearing and how long would be needed to implement them while minimising costs and stability risks, Berrigan said.
""If you make it open ended, the risk is you will never finish,"" Berrigan said. ""It's not drawing on protectionism or drawing on drawbridges, it's about finding the right balance in terms of our relationship, in terms of our alliances.""
Froukelien Wendt, a member of ESMA's clearing supervisory committee, said the report looks at the effect of cutting off EU market participants from clearers in London.

""There are also benefits and they relate to the ability of EU supervisors, EU authorities especially in times of crisis, to access information and to be able to intervene effectively,"" Wendt said.
The EU will have to build up ""best in class"" clearing capacity that is attractive and competitive, Berrigan said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A planned pan-European payments network backed by 22 banks to compete with U.S. duo Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) appealed on Tuesday for public money, saying its private backers were not prepared to stump up all the cash needed.
The European Payments Initiative (EPI) was launched last year and is seeking to get more banks and other players in payments on board by December to finalise plans to start rolling out its instant and card payments network.
""Public funding would be nice,"" EPI Chief Executive Martina Weimert told an event held by the European Payments Institutions Federation. ""Let's not hide it - it's going to be a massive investment. It's expensive."" 
Retailers say they are not ready to pay for it, while banks and other EPI shareholders ""can carry only so much"", Weimert said, without giving details on the investment needed.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), UniCredit, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), ING, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and Sabadell are among the 22 banks from seven EU countries, including France, Germany and Spain who are backing the venture.
The European Union has been keen to achieve strategic autonomy in financial services, such as by cutting reliance on U.S. Mastercard and Visa for cross-border card payments. It's unclear whether that will extend to financial backing for EPI.
Weimert said EPI was now in a ""critical phase"" of decision making over the next few weeks. 

It will build a new system and largely replace a plethora of national systems to reduce fragmentation and overlaps in payments, she said, aiming to launch in 2022 peer-to-peer transactions based on instant payments, followed by e-commerce.
""It is a major shift so it will take time. Anybody who tells you it's an easy call and let's do it quick and dirty, well it's not really looking to transform the European ecosystem,"" Weimert added.

This, together with breakthroughs in chip-manufacturing processes, should drive the performances of popular chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI). But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) are two prominent players in the global semiconductor industry. AMD in Santa Calara, Calif., offers microprocessors, chipsets, GPUs, server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, and technology for game consoles, and provides assembly, testing, and packaging services. In comparison, ADI, in Norwood, Mass., designs, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of solutions that leverage high-performance analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing technology, including integrated circuits (ICs), algorithms, software, and subsystems for use in industrial, automotive, consumer, and communication markets.
Given the huge demand for semiconductor chips across various industries, governments worldwide are implementing measures to address the lingering supply-demand imbalance by helping semiconductor makers ramp up production. Increasing subsidies and investments should help semiconductor companies benefit from the sky-high demand. Despite the chip shortage, the global semiconductor industry witnessed 27.6% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter. And rising investor optimism in this space is evident in the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 18.8% gains over the past month, versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 4.8% returns. The global semiconductor market is expected to grow at a 7.7% CAGR to $778 billion by 2026. So, both AMD and ADI should benefit.
But, while ADI has gained 25.1% in price year-to-date, AMD has surged 38.9%. AMD is a clear winner with 40.8% gains versus ADI’s 12.7% returns in terms of their past month’s performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

The stock began trading on The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ""BROS"" on September 15, 2021. In comparison, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), which is headquartered in Seattle, Wash., operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. It offers various coffee and tea beverages, ready-to-drink beverages, and various food products.
Supply disruptions from Brazil to Vietnam and rising input costs have pushed coffee prices to seven-year highs recently. Arabica futures for March delivery increased 4.8% to $2.235 per pound in New York, the highest for a most-active contract since October 2014. Moreover, analysts expect that prices could surge as high as $3.
But because coffee is an essential part of so many people’s daily routines, coffee consumption is expected to be little affected notwithstanding its rising price.

(Reuters) -Some European stock indexes extended their record rally on Tuesday, boosted by shares of Dutch technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) and French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and lifted by optimism over easing in U.S.-China tensions.
The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.2% higher, while Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and euro zone shares all rose to new peaks.
Prosus NV rose 4.2% after forecasting higher profit for the first half of 2022 as it raised $12.3 billion from selling part of its stake in Tencent in April.
Kering was on top of the CAC 40, gaining 4.4% after its top brand Gucci said it expected 2021 revenues to be in line or higher than their pre-pandemic level. HSBC upgraded the stock to ""buy"".

Data showed euro zone gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.2% quarter-on-quarter in the July-September period, as expected.
""The decent increase in euro-zone GDP in Q3 means that the recovery is now almost complete in most of the region,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics. 
The STOXX 600 has scaled fresh peaks in November as an encouraging earnings season, dovish signals from the European Central Bank and improving economic data helped investors look past inflationary pressures as well as a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases across the continent.
ECB President Christine Lagarde on Monday reiterated her push back against market bets for tighter monetary policy.
""We're seeing record highs but only incremental moves, which is a sign of where we stand right now,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.

337,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 12:09PM ET</span>",Biden Seeks to Revive His Approval Rating as He Touts Infrastructure Bill,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden will seek to reverse his slumping popularity as he travels to New Hampshire on Tuesday -- part of a nationwide campaign to promote $550 billion in new infrastructure spending.
Biden will give a speech at a bridge over the Pemigewasset River that’s among the state’s list of “structurally deficient” crossings, a day after signing the infrastructure legislation that cleared Congress earlier this month.
Biden is counting on the bill to revive his political fortunes as his poll numbers sag amid concern over inflation, legislative gridlock and the lingering Covid-19 pandemic. He and top administration officials are fanning out around the country to champion the measure. 
While passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill is a potential turning point, the fate of other half of Biden’s domestic agenda remains unclear.
“My message to the American people is this: America is moving again,” Biden said at the White House on Monday. The law “is proof that despite the cynics, Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results.”
2022 Election
New Hampshire is a swing state, and incumbent Maggie Hassan is among the Senate Democrats who may be facing competitive contests next year. Democrats are at risk of losing their narrow majorities in both chambers in those midterm elections.
Inflation continues to hurt Biden’s standing with voters. U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, cementing high inflation as a hallmark of the pandemic recovery and eroding spending power even as wages surge.
Data released Tuesday showed that retail sales jumped 1.7%, beating economists’ estimates and signaling that Americans continue to sustain a robust pace of merchandise spending despite price increases. 
A Washington Post-ABC News poll, taken after the infrastructure bill passed the House but before it was signed, found Biden had a 41% approval rating, down from 44% two months earlier and 50% at the end of June. Just 39% of people approved of his handling of the economy, the poll found. 
Biden has touted the infrastructure bill as a measure that will ease bottlenecks driving inflation over the long term, such as at ports, as Republicans seize on the issue to oppose his agenda over fears it will further push up prices.
Democrats continue to haggle over Biden’s other major legislative package, which includes social programs and tax changes that leaders aim to pass through reconciliation, an approach that doesn’t require Republican votes. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the bill is due this week, and threatens to delay a planned House vote amid signs that the administration’s revenue projections may fall short.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 12:03PM ET</span>",Planemakers grab deals at Dubai Airshow,"By Alexander Cornwell and Tim Hepher
DUBAI (Reuters) -Global aerospace firms have secured tentative or firm orders for more than 400 airplanes at the Dubai Airshow, building on signs of a recovery from a global pandemic that has shattered the industry's profits.
After major orders for narrowbody jets and a new freighter earlier this week, Airbus secured a tentative deal for up to 30 A320neo narrowbody jets from Kuwait's Jazeera Airways, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) ended a recent dearth of orders in India.
Most of the planes ordered were narrowbody models in highest demand from low-cost carriers like Europe's Wizz Air and Boeing's latest customer, Indian startup Akasa.
""I believe this is a sign of recovery. The second half of the decade when most of these aircraft will be delivered is a long time from now, so it is reasonable to expect that at that point traffic will exceed pre-COVID levels,"" said independent aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
""It is also reasonable to expect that those who emerge from the crisis with lower costs and higher efficiency will win,"" he added. 
A major question marks hangs over Asia, previously the engine of new jetliner demand, executives said, while some fretted over the concentration of orders among a few carriers.
Airlines and suppliers nonetheless seized on signs of a fragile recovery, using the deadline of air show publicity to try to win last-minute concessions.
The deal between Airbus and Kuwait's Jazeera comes after the airline's chairman, Marwan Boodai, told Reuters this month the budget carrier was aiming to buy up to $2 billion worth of jets. 
Akasa Air, backed by billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, finalised an order for 72 Boeing 737 MAX jets in a move that will help the U.S. planemaker regain lost ground in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.
Boeing is also relying on the order to lend fresh support for the MAX, which remains grounded in China following an almost two-year safety ban that was lifted in the West late last year. 
The deal includes a high-density 200-seat version of the Boeing 737 MAX known as 8200, making Akasa the second major customer for that layout after Ireland's Ryanair, which is locked in a dispute with Boeing over prices of new planes.
The 8200's configuration is suited to ultra-low-cost-carriers focused on driving down costs per seat, though industry sources said Akasa would also have to fight for competitive airport costs to succeed in India's choppy airline market.
Nigerian carrier Ibom Air, owned by the Akwa Ibom state government, confirmed a deal for 10 Airbus A220s.
BORDER RULES
Demand for wide-body jets underpinning big Gulf travel hubs like Dubai and Doha, whose carrier Qatar Airways is absent from this year's show amid lingering diplomatic wounds in the region from a recent rift between Gulf states, remains thin as international travel recovers slowly from pandemic restrictions.
""Once we see the relaxation of borders, entry requirements and all the other paraphernalia with people travelling these days... then you will see the bounceback in the countries that we are now flying to,"" said Emirates President Tim Clark.
The Emirates executive urged Boeing to provide firm dates for its delayed 777X, saying certification uncertainty had upended the carrier's growth plans. Boeing had no immediate comment. 
Emirates is the largest customer for the previous version of 777 as well as the Airbus A380 superjumbo, whose production is ending due to low sales.
Clark, who has been among the biggest champions for the A380, predicted the double-decker would prove its mettle when travel recovers from the COVID-19 crisis. Some other industry leaders see a move toward smaller and more flexible jets.
As supply chain problems hit manufacturing worldwide, Clark said Airbus had not been able to give a date for ""even the last"" A380 delivery that had been due mid-December.

He also noted that labour shortages were hurting the industry.
An Airbus spokesman said, ""All deliveries are agreed with the customer and it is the customer's privilege to announce them.""

Let’s discuss.Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing has not only introduced versatility and inclusiveness into corporate board rooms, it has also provided many retail investors with opportunities to make investments consistent with their values.

Also, BlackRock’s iShares has predicted that investment in this space will grow to $1 trillion by 2030.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed consumers’ outlook to now value healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. It is no longer exclusively physical health that consumers are seeking. Instead, holistic development that includes environmental health, food health, mental health, and social health are in much greater demand. The pandemic has accelerated trends in health and sustainability, thereby driving changes in consumer behavior. Furthermore, the global healthcare cloud computing market, which can be viewed as a branch of the sustainable healthcare industry, is expected to grow at a 28.5% CAGR CAGR between 2020 - 2026.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>","After rally in U.S. retailers, investors eye upcoming reports","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Recent gains in U.S. retailer shares could be put to the test in the coming days as top companies in the sector report quarterly results and investors hunt for clues about how well they have managed supply-chain problems.
Retail companies have had a strong run so far this month, with the S&P 500 retailing exchange-traded fund up about 10% compared with a roughly 2% gain for the S&P 500.
That has roughly coincided with upbeat signs as the world opens up after the global pandemic and looks to new treatments such as COVID-19 antiviral pills to keep infections in check.
The third-quarter earnings season is in the final stretch, with less than 10% of the companies in the S&P 500 still to report. A big chunk of those will be retailers, with many due to post results this week. 
But whether retailers can sustain recent gains could depend on how well they have managed the global supply-chain crisis and other inflationary pressures because of the pandemic, which have raised additional concerns about the critical holiday shopping period.
Earlier on Tuesday, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc raised its annual sales and profit forecast even as global supply-chain disruptions hit margins in the third quarter. Its shares were down about 2% on Tuesday morning.
At the same time,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), helped by the strong housing market, beat quarterly sales estimates by nearly $2 billion, and its shares shot up by more than 4%.
 Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Macy's (NYSE:M) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) are among a slew of others also expected to report this week. 
""Traditionally, you want to be long retail going into Black Friday,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, referring to the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday that unofficially marks the start of the holiday shopping season.
""That said, there are significant supply-chain unknowns,"" he added. ""Who managed to do well in spite of the supply-chain challenges? That's the biggest question that's going to be answered by each individual company.""
While reports need to be examined individually, investors want to see increased guidance from companies with strong recent gains, James said.
""Any whiff of disappointment is not being treated well,"" he noted.
Some retailers likely have been able to raise prices to maintain margin levels. 
A report from the U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested high inflation was not yet dampening spending. U.S. retail sales surged in October, likely helped by Americans who started their holiday shopping early because of supply shortages.
Of all S&P 500 companies that have reported, about 80% have beaten analysts' expectations, and the forecast for year-on-year third-quarter earnings growth is now at 41.5%, up from the 29.4% seen at the beginning of October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Consumer discretionary earnings growth, which includes many retailers, is estimated at 14.5% compared with 8% at the start of October, based on Refinitiv data.
Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv, wrote in a report on Monday that e-commerce sales results will be watched to see if the move to online spending may be fading.
The latest third-quarter digital sales growth estimates suggest business volume is ""holding up,"" she said.
Expenses will be another key issue when investors scrutinize results.

""I caution whether it's going to be a slam dunk,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, noting that year-over-year comparisons are going to be ""hard to beat going forward.""
""All of these companies are trying to build up cloud platforms, their delivery service, automations, robotics ... so even if sales are at record levels, I would say expenses are at record levels.""

(Reuters) -Home Depot Inc beat quarterly sales estimates by nearly $2 billion on Tuesday and signaled a strong start to the holiday season as Americans spend more on tools and materials to complete large home improvement projects.
Shares of the largest U.S. home improvement chain rose 4%, hitting a record high.
Professional contractors such as builders and handymen have been rushing back to  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD)'s stores as they look to upgrade their toolkits and source building materials to complete a backlog of home improvement and repair jobs that were put on hold during the COVID-19 crisis.
Rising house prices in the United States has also given people confidence to invest in home upgrades, while more millenials moving to suburban areas during the pandemic has expanded the customer base of retailers like Home Depot.
Despite fears that demand from do-it-yourself customers would wane this year as people get back to spending more time outside their homes, Home Depot Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said sales at the company's stores were still holding strong.
""We had expected that, as the year progressed, you might see customers reverting back and spending in other areas. That may have affected us, but we really haven't seen that. Demand continues to remain strong,"" Menear said on an analyst call.
The company's same-store sales rose 6.1% in the third quarter, beating estimates of a 1.4% increase, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Overall net sales rose nearly 10% to $36.82 billion, above estimates of $35.01 billion.

Home Depot said same-store sales in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter were trending higher than third-quarter numbers.
Executives also said Home Depot had received most of its fourth-quarter products, easing concerns of holiday season shortages. The company has been spending heavily to get around global supply chain logjams, including even chartering its own cargo ships.

Considering this, we believe investors are better off avoiding for now fundamentally weak cannabis stocks Curaleaf (CURLF),  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC), and Grow Generation (GRWG). These stocks have also been downgraded recently by analysts. Read on.Although the U.S. cannabis industry has been gaining steam, in-part due to the hopes around a Republican-led legalization effort, the health risks associated with the use of marijuana and its strong addiction in adolescents could curb the industry’s growth. Despite marijuana becoming mainstream in many states, it remains a thorny issue because growing cannabis is a federal crime that transgresses the Controlled Substances Act.
Furthermore, with the laws around cannabis becoming gradually more favorable, more players are entering the cannabis space, making the industry highly competitive. This trend could negatively impact the market share of existing players.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to steer clear of cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CURLF), Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC), and  GrowGeneration  Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG). The companies possess weak fundamentals, and analysts have recently downgraded these stocks.

So, let’s discuss.The stock market remains volatile, and consumer price data is indicating significantly higher-than-expected inflation. The Consumer Price Index rose 6.2% in October from a year earlier, its steepest annual climb in almost 31 years. Although equities, in general, perform poorly during inflation, specific sectors, including energy, tend to shine amid an inflationary environment.
The energy sector has beaten inflation 71% of the time and delivered an annual real return of 9% per year on average. This is primarily because energy-focused companies’ revenues are tied to energy prices, a key inflation component. Higher energy prices lead to higher revenues and profits for energy companies.
So, as energy prices continue to climb, we think it could be wise to invest in quality energy ETFs—Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE), SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP), and iShares U.S. Energy ETF (IYE).

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Tuesday after a strong retail sales report for October and robust earnings from major retailers again indicated that the economy is strong enough to withstand the removal of extreme monetary stimulus.
Retail sales rose by 1.7% in October, their sharpest monthly rise since March, with a notable rebound in auto sales, a category that had suffered in previous months from a shortage of inventory due to the inability of chipmakers to keep pace with raging demand for electronics. Industrial production data released separately showed an 11% monthly increase in vehicle production.
The macro numbers found clear echoes in stronger-than-expected quarterly results from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and - in particular  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD). Walmart's comparable store sales rose 9.2% on the year, as the company succeeded in pushing through price increases and store visits recovered from the effects of the pandemic. The stock still fell 1.9% to its lowest in a month, on concerns that early holiday shopping may cannibalize the fourth quarter's numbers.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dominated by old-world cyclical stocks, was up 142 points, or 0.4%, at 36,229 points. The S&P 500 was up just over 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up a little less than that. 
Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock rose 3.0% after its results profited from sustained demand from builders for tools and materials, suggesting that the boom in home improvement and construction still has plenty of legs yet. In a not-unrelated development, U.S. federal agencies are set to raise the ceiling for mortgage loans that they will back to nearly $1 million later this month, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The National Association of Home Builders' monthly report on the housing market is due at 10 AM ET.
Electric vehicle stocks were conspicuously strong again, with Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock both rising 6.8% against a backdrop of euphoria as the two companies begin commercial deliveries. Lucid said after the close on Monday that its order book had grown 5% to 13,000. With a market capitalization of $72 billlion, that equates to over $5 million of market value that the company has so far either sold or agreed to sell.
Rivian, for its part, has quickly become the third-most valuable automotive company in the world within a week of its listing. It is yet to sell a single vehicle. Even investment guru Cathie Wood, known for her tolerance of highly-priced long-duration stocks, has said her ARK Investment Fund won't be buying Rivian for the foreseeable future.

Moreover, the initiatives of governments worldwide to transition to zero-emission vehicles should power the industry’s growth over the short- and long term. With that, Wall Street analysts expect low-priced electric vehicle stocks Faraday Future (FFIE), Electric Last Mile (ELMS), and Hyzon Motors (HYZN) to gain more than 70% in price in the near term. So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist. Let’s examine these names.Although last year was rough for the automotive industry, the strong demand for electric vehicles (EVs) was a bright spot. Increasing fuel prices and government incentives for consumers to replace internal-combustion vehicles with EVs have boosted sales this year also. To meet the rising demand, automakers are increasingly investing in the EV space. Indeed, the global EV market is expected to reach $812.89 billion by 2028, registering a 19.8% CAGR.
EV sales increased 160% year-over-year in the first half of 2021 to 2.6 million units, representing 26% of new sales in the global automotive market. EV sales are surging due to improvements in battery technology, declining costs, more charging infrastructures, and new attractive models from automakers, among other factors. Furthermore, President Biden wants EV sales to account for 50% of all new vehicle sales by 2030.
Therefore, we think it could be worth watching EV Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (FFIE), Electric Last Mile Solutions, Inc. (ELMS), and Hyzon Motors Inc. (HYZN) because Wall Street analysts expect these below-$10 stocks to gain more than 70% in the near term.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -As developer China Evergrande Group scrambles to meet its debt obligations, its founder is freeing up funds from luxury assets including art, calligraphy and three high-end homes, according to filings and a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Chinese authorities have told Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan, 63, to use some of his personal wealth to help pay bondholders, two separate people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last month.
Evergrande's troubles in meeting bond repayments have rattled markets https://www.reuters.com/business/how-china-evergrandes-debt-troubles-pose-systemic-risk-2021-09-16 and left many of its investors, creditors and suppliers in financial chaos. 
Guo Hui, whose cleaning business is owed more than 18 million yuan ($2.8 million) by Evergrande, had to sell his Porsche Cayenne and an apartment to raise cash and pay debts https://www.reuters.com/world/china/unpaid-by-evergrande-supplier-sells-porsche-home-rescue-his-business-2021-09-28/#:~:text=Unpaid%20by%20Evergrande%2C%20supplier%20sells%20Porsche%20and%20home%20to%20rescue%20his%20business,-By%20David%20Kirton&text=In%20the%20meantime%2C%20the%2050,to%20pay%20debts%20and%20wages.
""He should be selling his things,"" Guo told Reuters. ""He had no choice once the authorities made him.""
Hui pledged one of his Hong Kong mansions of around 5,000 square feet in The Peak, Hong Kong's most prestigious residential enclave with sweeping views over the city's gleaming skyscrapers, for a loan from China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) in October, according to a filing with Hong Kong's Land Registry.
The property is worth around HK$800 million ($103 million), an estate agent told Reuters and local media said it was pledged to raise about HK$300 million to repay an overdue Evergrande bond.
The tycoon, ranked as Asia's wealthiest man in 2017, pledged two other luxury houses in the same development to  Orix  (NYSE:IX) Asia Capital Ltd on Nov 8. for undisclosed amounts, according to the Land Registry. Local media outlet HK01 said on Tuesday the total amount raised was HK$821 million.
One of the properties is worth HK$800 million, the estate agent said, while the other one is bigger and according to HK01 is worth HK$1 billion.
Hui and Evergrande did not respond to requests for comment regarding the properties on The Peak. 
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
LUXURY ASSETS
Raised by his grandmother https://www.reuters.com/world/china/evergrandes-billionaire-boss-exudes-calm-debt-risks-grow-2021-09-01 in a rural village, Hui founded Evergrande in 1996 in southern Guangzhou city, supplying low-priced homes and building a fortune.
He developed a passion for calligraphy, art and Koi carp - fish seen as a symbol of good luck and fortune for which he paid tens of millions of yuan, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Under Hui's orders, Evergrande has been selling some art and calligraphy to raise fresh capital, said the source. The source declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.
Reuters could not immediately determine how much had been raised by selling the art pieces or what the money has been used for.
Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment regarding the art sale.
The source also said Evergrande sold two Gulfstream jets in recent weeks.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy believes it should have been asked to approve the purchase of a military drones company by Chinese investors, and will issue a complaint that could eventually sink the deal if it doesn't get a satisfactory explanation, three sources said.
Rome opened an inquiry in August into the 2018 sale of a 75% stake in Alpi Aviation, based in northern Italy, to see whether it should have been notified about the transaction under so-called golden power regulations for strategically important assets.
The deal showed how easy it was for changes in corporate ownership to go under the radar at a time when pressure is rising in the United States and Europe to monitor potential risks to national security from Chinese investors.
The Chinese groups involved in the takeover through a chain of investment vehicles are China Corporate United Investment Holding and CRRC Capital Holding, which are in turn controlled by the Management Committee of Wuxi Liyuan Economic Development Zone and SASAC.
A request for comment sent to these entities went unanswered outside of business hours, while the office of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi declined to comment.
Alpi Aviation was not immediately available to comment. Its lawyers have previously said the company complied with all rules in the sale.
After an in-depth analysis, the government is preparing a formal notice to be sent to all involved parties asking for clarifications, the three sources directly involved in the case said.
Italian authorities are paying ""utmost attention"" to the matter, one of them added.
The case became public in September, when the Italian tax police disclosed a probe into the deal over an alleged breach of rules regarding the sale of military materials, saying six people were under investigation.
Police at that time said the deal was ""clearly"" a predatory investment in technology. 
A fourth source said the Chinese investors paid almost 6 million euros ($6.8 million) for the 75% stake.
Rome could impose penalties which, in the most serious case, might lead to the sale being invalidated.
The government has special anti-takeover powers to shield strategic assets from non-European Union and - on a temporary basis until Dec. 31 - EU groups.
Italy has so far used its golden powers four times since 2012 to block foreign interests in Italy. Three of these headed off Chinese bids, and two have been since Drgahi's government took office nine months ago.

Draghi vetoed last month the sale of a vegetable seed producer to Chinese-owned group Syngenta, and prevented in April Chinese company Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co. Ltd. from buying a controlling stake in a firm producing semiconductor equipment.

366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",Tesla's Dizzying Swings Give Institutional Investors a Headache,"(Bloomberg) -- Big investors love many things about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Volatility isn’t one of them.
Despite a trillion dollar valuation, pole position in the electric-vehicle business and entry to the S&P 500, the world’s sixth-largest listed company is subject to greater swings than any other U.S. megacap technology stock, with 21 daily moves of at least 5% to the upside or downside this year.
“It is not a name we would recommend to our clients,” said Edmund Shing, BNP Paribas Wealth’s chief investment officer, citing volatility brought about by high levels of interest among retail investors.
Tesla may be in for another choppy session on Tuesday after the post-market disclosure that Elon Musk exercised options and sold more shares. That continued a streak of sales that has caused the stock to fall almost 20% in the past week or so, wiping about $200 billion off the company’s market value. Tesla was down 0.5% as 7:07 a.m. in premarket trading.
Still, it’s hard to completely ignore a stock that’s still up 44% in 2021, after surging more than eightfold the year before.
Shing recommends gaining exposure through exchange traded funds or other passive investing methods. “We prefer our clients to take indirect exposure that way, so as to benefit from some diversification and the offset to volatility that other stocks can provide.”
Indeed that’s been the general narrative in the latest regulatory filings from institutional investors. Hedge funds have increased the amount of exchange-traded funds in their portfolios in the third quarter, while decreasing their exposure to single stocks, according to 13F filings.
Retail’s Sugar Rush
Tesla’s addition to the S&P 500 late last year didn’t go down too well with institutional holders averse to volatility. They included Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer and senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds.
With a 2%-plus weighting on the U.S. benchmark index, Stoeckle had to look beyond Tesla’s frequent wild swings and buy in, he said by phone.
At the other end of the spectrum, amateur traders have been gobbling up Tesla stock through call options -- used to position for gains in stocks. According to Goldman Sachs, Tesla and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) represented more than half of the single-stock options traded in early November.
But Musk’s near $8 billion stock sale might act as a deterrent, at least for now. “The recent fall might have put off some retail investors,” said Jim Dixon, a sales trader at Mirabaud Securities. The alternative for them is the recently listed electric-vehicle company Rivian Automotive Inc., he said.
Rivian has doubled from its initial public offering price of $78 in less than a week, with its breathtaking rally extending in Tuesday premarket trading. The stock is poised to add another 4.6%, putting it on track to top one of the world’s biggest carmakers, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), by market capitalization.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>",Amazon's healthcare business has landed Hilton as a key customer,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc has reached a deal to sell virtual medical services to Hilton in the United States, landing a marquee customer for its nascent healthcare business.
The company declined to disclose financial terms of its agreement with the hotel chain.
The world's biggest online retailer has looked to sign up employers to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Care, its on-demand health offering that lets users message or video-chat clinicians and receive home visits in some cities. Amazon piloted the service for its employees around Seattle in 2019, and this summer it started marketing Care nationwide to other companies.
The deal with  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc, which Reuters is first to report, marks Amazon Care's first hospitality customer and only its second disclosed client after fitness equipment maker Precor. It shows how the company is seeking to disrupt the healthcare industry with a tried-and-true playbook.
Just as Amazon built data centers to satisfy its e-commerce needs and later sold access to this infrastructure in what became its cloud-computing business, so is Amazon looking to market a healthcare service it built first for its workers' benefit.
Speaking at Reuters' Total Health conference on Monday, Kristen Helton, director of Amazon Care, called the Hilton deal ""a great step forward for the business to show we can provide care nationwide to their team members."" https://reutersevents.com/events/healthcare
Hilton employed about 141,000 people globally as of Dec. 31, 2020. All its U.S. staff enrolled in a corporate health plan will have Amazon Care as a benefit next year.
That means virtual meetings with clinicians from Care Medical, a company focused on serving Amazon Care users. Amazon also offers house calls in greater Seattle and the Washington-Baltimore metro area, with plans to expand to Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Boston.
Helton said employers' pandemic safety concerns and recruiting needs during a labor shortage have contributed to demand.
""Attracting and retaining talent is so critical for businesses right now,"" she said.
Hilton pays for workers' access to care and for a portion of the visit expenses. Text chats via Amazon Care will be free to the hotel chain's employees, while provider video or home visits carry a small fee, she said.
Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a greater role in the future, too.

""We will have clinicians in the loop for a period of time until we can actually trust that AI and those technology solutions are taking care of the patient in the way that is best,"" Helton said.
Amazon is looking to technology to reduce providers' post-care work and lower costs, though the human connection remains very important, she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mobile operator Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) increased its free cash flow forecast on Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected growth in earnings in its first half, driven by a good performance in Germany, its largest market.
Vodafone shares, which have fallen 15% since the start of its financial year, rose as much as 6%.
The British company raised the floor of its full-year earnings guidance to 15.2 billion euros ($17.3 billion) from 15.0 billion euros, with the top remaining at 15.4 billion, and increased its free cash flow target by 100 million euros to at least 5.3 billion euros.
Chief Executive Nick Read said Vodafone had ""solid commercial momentum"".
""Our strengthened performance in Africa and Europe puts us on track to be at the top end of our guidance for this year, as well as firmly within our medium-term financial ambitions,"" he said.
Vodafone said its total revenue grew 5% to 22.5 billion euros in the six months to end-September, driven by service revenue growth in Europe and Africa and a recovery in handset sales following COVID-19 disruption in the prior year. 
Adjusted core earnings rose 6.5% rise to 7.6 billion euros
Organic service revenue grew in both Germany and Britain, but fell in Italy, and declined in Spain after growth in the first quarter evaporated in the second.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Explainer-Germany's Nord Stream 2 gatekeeper: the long road until gas flows,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's energy regulator said on Tuesday it had suspended the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to carry Russian gas to Europe and said the Swiss-based consortium needed to form a company under German law to get an operating licence.
Europe's most controversial energy project, which is led by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), has faced resistance from the United States and Ukraine amongst others.
Surging gas prices in Europe caused by a jump in global demand as the economy recovers from COVID-19, has led some government officials and industry to demand more Russian supplies.
Prior to Tuesday's decision, the German regulator last month asked the pipeline operator, Swiss-based Nord Stream 2 AG, for assurances it would not break competition rules. 
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates the country's electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway sectors - has until early January to come up with a recommendation on whether it will certify the pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
While technical requirements have been met, the sticking point is whether Gazprom will comply with European unbundling rules that require pipeline owners to be different from suppliers of gas flowing in them to ensure fair competition.
The Nord Stream 2 operator says the rules are aimed at torpedoing the pipeline and in October scored a partial victory when an adviser to the European Union's top court recommended that Gazprom could challenge UPDATE 2-Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 can challenge EU rules, EU court adviser says - Reuters News the EU rules.
The project's identically-sized sister pipeline, Nord Stream 1, has been exempt from unbundling rules since opening in 2011 because it was treated as an interconnector rather than as direct supplier.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION?
Once a three-member independent ruling committee at the network agency has made its recommendation it goes to the European Commission, which has another two months to respond.
If both bodies are in agreement that the pipeline fulfils all regulatory requirements then certification can be issued relatively quickly, but if they aren't the process could be further delayed.
Certification can be only given if both have worked out any differences that may arise, which means that it could take until spring 2022 before the pipeline gets certified and can officially start operation.
CAN THE AGENCY BLOCK THE PIPELINE?
Effectively, no. Even though certification is a requirement the network agency is limited in how it can prevent Gazprom from simply starting to pump gas right away.
Its toughest tool is a one-time 1 million euro ($1.2 million) fine on the operator if it starts operation without certification.
As a regulator it can also launch an investigation but any legal process is expected to be lengthy and will not result in a short-term prevention of gas flows.
Gazprom said in August it expects Nord Stream 2 https://www.reuters.com/article/nordstream-outlook-idUSL1N2PQ18X to deliver 5.6 billion cubic metres bcm, about a tenth of the pipeline's annual capacity, already in 2021 if supplies start in October.
WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES?
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that playing by the rules is vital to ensuring ongoing political support for the pipeline, two government sources familiar with the matter have said.
Merkel openly said that the political basis for operating Nord Stream 2 was Russia's commitment to continue to use Ukraine as a gas transit route in the future as well.
""Putin is smart enough to know that the sentiment among German politicians regarding the project will become rather problematic, so he should not provide any reason to endanger operations,"" one of the sources said.
IS THE NETWORK AGENCY POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT?
No. For its own recommendation the agency needs a binding assessment on supply security by Germany's Economy and Energy Ministry, of which it is a part.
""Certification can only be granted if the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy determines that granting certification will not jeopardise the security of gas supply of the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union,"" a spokesperson for the agency said.
Last month, the Economy Ministry said allowing Nord Stream 2 to pump Russian gas to Germany would not threaten supplies to the European Union.
WILL GERMANY'S ELECTION HAVE AN IMPACT?
Until a new government is in place, Germany's Economy Ministry is led by Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel's conservative party, which has backed the pipeline.
Under Merkel, who is running the country until a new coalition is formed, Germany in July struck a deal https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-germany-nord-stream-2-idAFL1N2OX1W6 with Washington to allow the pipeline to go ahead.
As a result, the threshold for the next government to reverse the deal is very high, even in the likely event that the Greens - which have fiercely opposed the project - become part of the next ruling coalition, two people familiar with the matter said.

In addition, Olaf Scholz, who led the Social Democrats to victory in September's election and stands a good chance of succeeding Merkel as chancellor, has been in favour of the pipeline.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) fell more than 1% in Tuesday’s premarket trade after the company said it will sell its Covid-19 oral drug in low- and middle-income countries without earning royalties as long as the World Health Organization keeps the pandemic classified as a public health emergency of international concern.
Pfizer has signed a licensing pact with UN-backed public health organization called Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), to expand access for the oral medicine in low- and middle-income countries.
Under the deal, qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide that are granted sub-licenses will be able to supply the medicine, covering up to approximately 53% of the world’s population.
The drug was expected to be another money-spinner for the pharmaceutical giant after the success of its Covid-19 vaccine, providing a second line of defense against the disease for health authorities and a second pillar of income for the company.
MPP has already invited expressions of interest from parties to manufacture and sell the co-pack containing the drug, scientifically known as PF-07321332, as well as ritonavir, the HIV drug that has to be jointly given under the prescribed treatment.
The pill, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, is one of only three oral medicines so far to prove their efficacy against Covid-19, along with treatments from Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). Pfizer claims to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%. Merck's (NYSE:MRK) molnupiravir, boasts an efficacy ratio of just over 50%.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Apple Inc and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google are not doing enough to comply with a South Korean law that bars dominant app store operators from forcing app developers to use their payment systems, a lawmaker who spearheaded the amendment told Reuters. 
South Korea, the first country to impose legislation curbing the tech companies' payment policies, is expected to make public the initial details of what it takes to comply with the law on Wednesday, an official at the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said. 
It amended the Telecommunication Business Act in August to try to curb the tech majors' market dominance and stop the big app store operators charging commissions on in-app purchases. 
The law went into effect in September but details of what would constitute compliance are being drafted by the KCC in an enforcement ordinance. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had told the South Korean government that it was already complying and did not need to change its app store policy nL4N2RB0QK. Google said it planned to allow third-party nL1N2RV03J payment systems in South Korea, but will only reduce its service charge to developers by 4 percentage points when users choose an alternative billing system.
The tech companies charge developers as much as 30% of their sales in in-app transactions.
""Frankly, we are not satisfied... Apple's claim that it's already complying is nonsensical,"" lawmaker Jo Seoung-lae who spearheaded the amendment said. 
""Excessive fees take away developers' chances for innovation ... parliament is to be closely informed as the government drafts detailed regulations to make sure there is accountability,"" Jo said. 
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
FIRST IN WORLD
""This is the first legislation worldwide with the chance to transform the market from a duopoly with Apple and Google,"" Tim Sweeney, CEO of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games and a vocal Apple critic told Reuters. 
Last year, ""Fortnite"" was kicked off Apple and Google's app stores after Epic introduced a new payment system. 
But even if Apple adopts a similar position to Google by imposing a fee while allowing outside payments, Epic Games would not accept the stance, as Apple and Google charging any fee or imposing control over competing payment services ""ruins the point of competition"", he added. 
The KCC is drafting ""finely woven"" regulatory details for the ordinance that will be reported to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday and put into practice by March next year, KCC Vice Chairman Kim Hyun told a conference on app ecosystem fairness on Tuesday.
However, it is not clear what the penalties will be if the rules are breached.

An early draft of the enforcement ordinance seen by Reuters details a fine of up to ""2% of revenue"" as penalty for an infraction of the law by app market operators. 
""We've seen in other jurisdictions that these monetary penalties actually don't deter companies like Apple and Google because to them, it's a drop in the bucket,"" said Meghan DiMuzio, executive director of advisory group Coalition for App Fairness.

By Philip Blenkinsop and Promit Mukherjee
BRUSSELS/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Dutch brewer Heineken (OTC:HEINY) said on Monday it planned to take control of South Africa's Distell Group Holdings and Namibia Breweries Ltd to form a southern Africa drinks group worth 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion).
The takeover of Distell would mark a push into wine and spirits for the world's second-largest beer maker, with liqueur brand Amarula and wines labels Nederburg and Two Oceans. Heineken will sell Distell's British-based Scotch whiskies.
Heineken Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink said the deal would improve logistics and increase points of sale, often shared for beer, wine and spirits in South Africa, and would do the same in Namibia. It also offered growth in other African markets, such as Kenya and Tanzania, he said.
""It should not be seen that we now start to buy spirits and wine companies all over the world,"" Van den Brink told Reuters.
Heineken will pay 1.3 billion euros in cash and add its existing South African business, to secure at least 65% of the new business.
The deal will value Distell at about 40.1 billion rand ($2.6 billion) or 180 rand per share, Distell said, a discount of 1.4% to the stock's Friday close.
Heineken will take control of regional partner Namibian Breweries Ltd (NBL), with a current market valuation of about 400 million euros.
SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES
Heineken will buy the 50.01% interest of Ohlthaver & List Group of Companies in NBL Investment Holdings, which holds 59.4% of Namibia Breweries (NBL). Heineken holds the remaining 49.99% of the holding vehicle.
The transaction also entails Heineken's purchase of NBL's 25% shareholding in Heineken South Africa.
Van den Brink said the brewer expected cost and revenue synergies with benefits across production, logistics and procurement, but no job losses in the near term.
The overall transaction is expected to increase margins over the medium term and boost earnings per share within the first year after completion.
The takeovers would be the first major deal for Van den Brink, who took charge at Heineken in June 2020 and has launched a plan to restore profit margins, partly through cutting 8,000 jobs. Heineken did increase its stake to take full control of India's largest beer maker United Breweries Ltd in June.
Distell did not pay a dividend for the financial year ended June 30, as a condition for Heineken's takeover proposal.
Distell CEO Richard Rushton said the deal was likely to close by the end of December 2022 and shareholders would not be paid any interim or full-year dividend. 
Distell shares were trading down 7% at 169.34 rand as investors were not enthused by the offer price.
""Heineken and Remgro (Distell's holding company) are the winners in this,"" said Richard Cheesman, senior analyst with hedge fund Protea Capital Management, which holds shares in Distell.
""It matters less to Remgro what price Heineken is paying as it will remain invested in the unlisted Newco (new company), but shareholders were expecting that Remgro's influence could have resulted in a higher offer."" 
Heineken's shares were up 0.9% at 98.22 euros at 1425 GMT.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drugmakers hiked U.S. prices on seven of the 10 costliest prescription drugs in 2020 without justification, increasing drug spending by $1.67 billion, a U.S. group that reviews the value of medicines said on Tuesday.
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s widely used Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug accounted for the majority of the spending increase, with a net price increase of 9.6% leading to an almost $1.4 billion increase in U.S. spending.
The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said in a report that after reviewing published studies and input from drug manufacturers it found no evidence of new clinical benefits to justify the price hikes.
""Several of these treatments have been on the market for many years, with scant evidence that they are any more effective than we understood them to be years ago when they cost far less,"" said ICER Chief Medical Officer David Rind.
""The most extreme of these is Humira, with an ever-escalating U.S. price that contrasts starkly to its falling price in every country where Humira currently faces biosimilar competition,"" he said in a statement. Humira received U.S. regulatory approval in 2002.
AbbVie said in a response to ICER that the report lacked context because ICER does not perform full value assessments and excludes evidence from smaller patient populations.
The findings come as President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress attempt to push through legislation that would lower drug prices by allowing the federal government to negotiate drug payments by Medicare, which covers Americans aged 65 and older.
The United States spends more than twice as much per person on drugs as other wealthy economies, about $1,500, for a total of around $350 billion in 2019.

Novartis drug Promacta, which is used to treat the rare blood disorder severe aplastic anemia (SAA), saw the highest increase in net price at 14.1%, leading to a $100 million increase in U.S. spending.
Novartis said it takes a value-based pricing approach and that it provided ICER with significant new clinical and health economic data that the group did not take into account.

The U.S. equities market has been on a tear this year, with the benchmark index surging about 25% as the economy recovers from the pandemic lows, driving corporate earnings. 
However, Goldman's forecast for the index was in contrast with that of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which expects the S&P 500 to move lower in 2022, with a base case target of 4,400.
Goldman is expecting the index to hit 5,100 by the end of next year. It closed at 4,682.80 on Monday
""Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year,"" Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin said in a note. 
The brokerage expects net income per share to grow 8% to $226 in 2022. It had earlier raised the earnings per share forecast for S&P 500 companies to $207 from $193 for 2021, implying annual growth of 45%.

Profit margins will rise by 40 basis point to 12.6% in 2022, but fall in 2023 due to corporate tax reforms, Kostin added.
Even though real rates will rise, which refers to interest rate minus inflation, they will remain negative, and investor equity allocations will continue to post record highs, Kostin said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher, with investors digesting the release of quarterly earnings from a number of major retailers and ahead of  the latest official retail sales figures.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
The three major indices closed largely unchanged Monday, but came off their first losing week in six after last month’s consumer price data showed inflation running at historic levels, raising the pressure on the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates. 
However, before they hike rates the Fed policymakers will want to see that the higher prices haven't severely curtailed retail spending, with the strength of the consumer a very important part of the economic recovery. 
October retail sales data are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), with economists expecting an increase of 1.1%, after a 0.7% rise in September.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) both released results a little ahead of expectations, the latter helped by sustained demand for tools and materials from builders. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after JPMorgan Chase brought a $162 million lawsuit against the electric vehicle-maker alleging breach of contract over stock warrants that came due this year. 
Aside from this, investors will attempt to digest the potential repercussions of the virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese equivalent Xi Jinping, with the two leaders discussing a range of topics including trade, the pandemic, climate change and Taiwan.
Biden also signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law on Monday, authorizing funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
Crude prices rebounded Tuesday after recent losses, despite signs that supply may be picking up, altering the balance in favor of consumers.
The International Energy Agency said it expects global oil supply to rise by an average of 1.5 million barrels a day over the final two months of this year, helped by a 400,000 barrel-a-day increase in U.S. output. 
Data from Baker Hughes indicated that U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for a third week in a row last week.
Attention will turn to the release of U.S. crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the day.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $80.16 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $82.55. Both contracts dropped last week on the whole, for the third week in a row.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,875.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1368, near its new low for the year.

""Revenue streams from digital mediums for luxury brands are negligible... We think this is about to change,"" strategists at the U.S. investment bank wrote in a note on Tuesday.
""The Metaverse will likely take many years to develop; however, NFTs and social gaming (e.g., online games and concerts attended by people's avatars) present two nearer-term opportunities for luxury brands,"" it said.

It also said Italian brand Dolce & Gabbana's recent sale of nine NFTs for $5.7 million, albeit small, highlights the virtual and hybrid luxury goods' huge potential over the coming years.
""We expect the whole sector to benefit from the advent of the Metaverse, but see the soft luxury brands (ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, etc.) as particularly well positioned as opposed to hard luxury (jewellery and watches),"" it said.

Total sales were nearly 10% higher at $36.8 billion. Net earnings for the third quarter were $4.1 billion, or $3.92 per diluted share, compared to $3.18 in the same period last year.

The company’s stores stayed open during the pandemic last year and while it derived gains from the surge in consumption then, the retailer is still benefiting from people looking to re-do their dwellings. It is seeing new demand coming in from people who have shifted to suburban areas who are now looking to fix up the properties they have moved into.

The comments come hours after Keppel (OTC:KPELY) Corp on Tuesday said it would stick to its final offer following Cuscaden's sweetened nL1N2S50O1S$3.9 billion ($2.9 billion) bid, in a rare bidding war between two groups linked to Singapore state investor Temasek.
Keppel offered S$2.351 per share nL4N2S700T, or $2.8 billion. The two groups are vying for control of SPH's global portfolio of property assets, student accommodation and elderly care homes. 
Cuscaden - a consortium of billionaire property tycoon Ong Beng Seng's Hotel Properties and two independently managed portfolio companies of Temasek - will need SPH shareholders to first vote against Keppel's offer at a meeting next month, before a second vote later in favour of its own bid. 
""We would be definitely be reaching out to shareholders,"" Christopher Lim, Hotel Properties' group executive director and representative of the consortium said on Tuesday. 
SPH and Cuscaden have also entered into an implementation agreement and SPH's independent directors have preliminarily recommended the deal to shareholders.
It's ""unprecedented"" that SPH shareholders will get to vote first on Keppel's ""inferior"" bid, said Lim. He pointed to paid advertisements and social media as platforms Cuscaden would use to get the consortium's message to shareholders.
SPH shares closed 1.7% higher at S$2.37.

Keppel on Tuesday said it has already obtained regulatory approvals and its offer has a quicker path for the deal to be completed.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) slipped 0.7% in Tuesday’s premarket after a filing late Monday showed CEO Elon Musk sold more shares of the company.
A $162-million lawsuit that JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has brought against the electric vehicle-maker was also putting some marginal pressure on the stock.
The Wall Street giant on Monday filed a suit in the Southern District of New York against Tesla alleging breach of contract over stock warrants that came due this year. According to the bank, Tesla was required to deliver it shares or cash if its stock price was above the warrants' strike price at the time the contract between the companies expired, which was the case.
JP Morgan twice repriced the options over the episode, arguing its moves to adjust warrant prices were allowed under the contract. Tesla's lawyers argue that the bank was 'opportunistically' taking advantage of volatility in the company's stock price that followed Musk's infamous ""funding secured"" tweet in 2018, in which he falsely claimed to have secured financial backing to take the company back private. 
According to fresh disclosures, Musk’s sale of 934,000 shares Monday brings the total to 7.3 million and amounts to $7.8 billion, still away from the $10-billion tax bill reports say Musk faces. That means he may have to sell some more of the stock to meet his obligations.
That large tax bill is owing to the options awarded to Musk as compensation. He has earlier hinted at selling up to $20 billion worth of stock, around one-tenth of his overall holding.

The main operating unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc said it planned to expand cloud infrastructure, set up a research hub staffed by Australian researchers and engineers, and partner with science agency the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
Google Australia Managing Director Mel Silva, who earlier this year threatened to block Google's search engine in the country, said the spending plan would bring significant technology resources and investment.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the plan a ""A$1 billion vote of confidence"" in Australia, and said it would ""bring more STEM jobs to our shores"", using the acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
At a parliamentary hearing in January, Silva said Google might block its search engine in Australia to avoid new laws forcing the company and social media operator  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to pay news outlets for content posted to their websites.
However, the law went ahead and Google backed away from its threat. Google and Facebook instead struck licencing deals with most of Australia's main media companies. 
The federal government is scheduled to begin a review of the law's effectiveness in March.
Australia has also said it plans to make large internet companies take legal responsibilty for defamation and misinformation hosted on their platforms, a change which the technology sector has largely opposed.
The Australia Institute's Centre for Responsible Technology, a think tank, said the spending commitment made a ""great headline"" but ""simply paying tax on Australian earnings would deliver far more money to Australia"".

Google paid less than 1% tax on Australian annual earnings of about A$5 billion, and ""when big tech offers to put money into a nation there are always strings attached"", said centre director Peter Lewis.

The board of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which owns Audi, discussed the matter of getting a foot into the Formula One market at a meeting last week, said two sources who declined to be named. 
Audi CEO Markus Duesmann and Porsche CEO Oliver Blume were known as ""ardent fans of Formula One"", one source said.
McLaren Automotive on Monday denied a report that Audi had bought the British luxury sportscar maker, but left the door open to technological collaboration ""with relevant partners and suppliers.""
A spokesperson for Audi told Reuters it was ""looking at various cooperation ideas"" but did not confirm whether it was discussing a possible sale with McLaren.

Acquiring the carmaker would put a second supercar in Audi's books alongside Lamborghini, which it has owned since 1998.

(Reuters) -Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes, plans to spend most of its earnings from the first half of the year on its supply chain, with the UK battling a shortage of food items as it comes out of the pandemic.
The company, which traces its roots to the early 1800s, also said on Tuesday that it was spending to keep higher stock levels going into the Christmas season, citing that as a reason for recording 23.2 million pounds of outflow in the six months to Oct. 2. 
Economies across the world have faced a range of hurdles from tighter labour markets to snarled supply chains and a resultant increase in prices as they come out of prolonged lockdowns.
Some of the issues have been exacerbated in Britain by a shortage of workers from the European Union because of Brexit, while post-Brexit trade frictions https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/brexit-has-significantly-altered-irish-british-freight-traffic-report-finds-2021-08-12 also crop up. 
CHRISTMAS CAKES
Premier Foods noted these hurdles, while drawing attention to the shortage of lorry drivers, who are a key part of the supply chain especially during the festive season when volumes are driven up by gifts and food items as people get together.
""Much of our Christmas volumes have been produced and is now sitting in our warehouses and will be shipped over in the next few weeks. We are the peak of that now, it is essentially done,"" Premier Foods boss Alex Whitehouse told a media call.
The company posted 30.7 million pounds in pretax earnings for the six months to Oct. 2, a 39.2% drop compared with a year earlier, and guided to 25 million pounds in capital expenditure (capex) for the year as it invests more across the supply chain. 
In the half-year period, Premier Foods, which also makes Oxo stock cubes and Bisto gravy, said capex was 6.3 million pounds. 

""With further inflation now evident across a variety of input costs, the Group will be taking a range of actions which it expects will be effective later this financial year,"" Premier Foods said.
The company's shares fell 5% by 0941 GMT after the weaker earnings, while half-year revenue also fell 6.5% to 394.1 million pounds due to a tough comparative with a year earlier, when people cooked more at home due to lockdowns.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A consortium led by top executives of Razer Inc plans to value the Hong Kong-listed maker of gaming hardware at up to HK$35 billion ($4.5 billion) in a deal to take it private, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Chairman Min-Liang Tan and non-executive director Kaling Lim, with a combined stake of nearly 60% in Razer, lead the group offering up to HK$4 a share, the two sources said, or almost double its average price of HK$2.1 over the past month.
The move comes as the consortium believes Razer, based in the United States and Singapore, has been undervalued in Hong Kong, where investors typically pay more attention to tech firms from mainland China, they added.
The sources declined to be identified because of confidentiality constraints.
In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Razer cited its board as saying that there is no certainty that the discussions among Tan, Lim and the financial investors will ultimately lead to the terms of a potential transaction being agreed.
It said the potential offer price has not been determined and no decision had been made by Tan and Lim on whether to proceed with any potential transaction.
Razer declined to comment to Reuters and Tan and Lim also declined to comment on a Reuters query.
Shares of Razer ended 11.5% higher on Tuesday, after paring a rise of 23% in afternoon trade following the Reuters report.
A deal would further feed a surge in strategic investors and buyout firms tapping Hong Kong companies for take-private opportunities, lured by undervalued shares.
Hong Kong-listed firms have been involved in $8.15 billion worth of take-private deals in 2021, versus $23 billion for all of last year, Refinitiv data showed.
RAZER PERFORMANCE
In late October, Razer said in a filing Tan and Lim were in preliminary talks with financial investors to explore the possibility of a transaction.
The consortium is also in talks with private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for the buyout, said one of the two sources, and two others with knowledge of the matter.
Buyout firm KKR has also studied the deal but has yet to decide whether to invest, said the first two sources and another person.
CVC and KKR declined to comment. 
The talks have advanced and the consortium aims to announce the deal by the end of 2021, the first two sources said.
It aims to eventually list Razer in New York to exploit higher valuations for tech stocks, they added. 
Founded in the United States and Singapore in 2005, Razer has expanded from wireless mice to make gaming laptops and keyboards besides other accessories. 
It swung to a record net profit of $31.3 million in the first half of 2021, riding a gaming boom as lockdowns over COVID-19 kept people at home, versus a net loss of $17.7 million a year earlier.
The United States accounted for 42% of first-half revenue.
Razer went public at HK$3.88 per share in the Asian financial hub in 2017, in a stellar debut powered by strong retail demand for new technology stocks.
But its share price more than halved last month from this year's peak of HK$3.36 in February, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 24% over the same period. 

However, the shares have jumped 30% to five-month highs since the October filing on investor talks.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court ruled on Tuesday that the country's antitrust body has two weeks to decide whether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) misled authorities while seeking approval for a 2019 deal with India's Future Group, a group of Indian retailers said.
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said in a statement it had filed the case to the Delhi High Court on Monday and the ruling was made on Tuesday. 
Amazon and Future, India's second-largest retailer, have been locked in a legal battle since last year. The e-commerce giant successfully blocked Future's bid to sell its retail assets to rival Reliance for $3.4 billion, accusing its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements.
Future, which denies any wrongdoing and fears liquidation if it fails to sell assets, has been arguing before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that approval for the 2019 Amazon deal should be revoked as the U.S. firm had made misleading representations while seeking approval. Amazon has said it is confident of addressing such regulatory concerns.
On Tuesday, the CAIT said the antitrust body should not delay deciding on the matter, which has ramifications for the public interest and could hit their businesses if the Future-Reliance deal fails.
A two-judge panel said the CCI must decide on the dispute between Amazon and Future within two weeks, the retailer group said in its statement, adding that ""traders should not be made a scapegoat or suffer any financial loss.""
The CCI and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.
At the heart of the two companies' legal dispute is Amazon’s deal to invest $200 million in Future Coupons, a unit of Future Group, in 2019. 
One person familiar with the case said on Tuesday it would be unprecedented for the CCI to outrightly revoke a deal even if there has been misrepresentations, but any decision could affect the ongoing dispute.
""If there's no (2019) transaction, there's no dispute between Amazon, Future,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified because the person was not authorised to speak to the media.

In July, Reuters exclusively https://reut.rs/3HkZhmN reported that the CCI had reviewed a complaint from Future and then accused Amazon of concealing facts while seeking approval to invest in a Future Group unit in 2019, after the watchdog compared legal disclosures made by Amazon at several forums. 
Amazon told Reuters at the time that it was confident of addressing the watchdog's concerns.

MILAN (Reuters) -Investors are heading towards the end of the year in a ""risk-on"" mood, having reduced cash allocations and lifted their overweight position on U.S. stocks to the highest since August 2013, BofA Securities' monthly fund manager survey showed.
Inflation remains the biggest tail risk for markets but a majority of 61% believes it is transitory and expect the Federal Reserve to remain ""well behind the curve"" in setting its monetary policy, the U.S. investment bank added on Tuesday. 
The widely watched survey was conducted between the 5th to 11th November among investors with a total of $1.2 trillion of assets under management.
""Investors are not expecting the Fed to tighten aggressively (i.e. buy-in for Powell narrative on transitory inflation and modest tapering),"" said Bofa adding that investors now see on average 1.5 Fed rate hikes next year, up from 1.1 last month. 
Cash allocations fell to 4.4% in November from 4.7% in the previous survey last month, as investors increased their overall equity overweight and trimmed their overweight in commodities while remaining deeply underweight on bonds.
As fears about price pressures abated, investors rotated out of inflation assets, to discretionary and tech from energy, industrial and banks, while reducing value exposure to the benefit of growth. 

The survey highlighted easing concerns over a macro slowdown with a net of 3% now saying the global economy will improve and only 6 out of 100 expecting a recession in the next 12 months. 
It also said ""Long Tech Stocks"" was the most crowded trade at 37% followed by Bitcoin at 21% which a 59% majority thinks is in a bubble.

Investing.com –  Diageo  stock (LON:DGE) traded 2.5% higher in London as the world's biggest spirits distiller said it expects organic net sales growth of at least 16% in the first half of its ongoing financial year.
At a capital markets day presentation for investors, he maker of Johnny Walker whisky and Casamigos tequila also raised its medium-term guidance for sales growth by one percentage point to a range between 5% and 7% a year through 2023-2025. It now expects operating profit to grow by between 6% and 9% a year in that period.
That outlook suggests it expects last year's pandemic-induced acceleration in sales to be sustained, despite the gradual return to normal life in many of its biggest markets, even though year-on-year growth in the second half of the current year will slow due to base effects.
""We believe our sales growth trajectory has accelerated, underpinned by the strength of our advantaged position across geographies, categories and price tiers,"" CEO Ivan Manezes said. 
Diageo’s reported net sales in the last financial year were 12.7 billion British pounds (around $17 billion).
The company expects North America to lead sales with over 20% organic growth, driven by spirits taking a larger share of the overall alcohol market and by the replenishment of stock levels by distributors and retailers.

Trading in Kaisa Group and its three units listed in Hong Kong were suspended on Nov. 5 pending ""inside information"" from the company. Kaisa Group remains suspended, while the three units resumed trading on Tuesday.
Investors became concerned about Kaisa Group's liquidity after it missed payments on some wealth management products at home early this month. 
The Shenzhen-based developer, which has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after China Evergrande Group, has also likely missed coupon payments totalling over $59 million due last Thursday and Friday, rating agency Fitch said.
Kaisa did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Fitch downgraded Kaisa's Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating to ""C"" from ""CCC-"" on Tuesday on the payments it considered missing. 
One bondholder told Reuters he has not received the payment for both bonds yet, which both have a 30-day grace period.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>",Column: Funds pause record selling of 10-year Treasuries,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Hedge funds paused their relentless selling of 10-year Treasuries futures ahead of last week's U.S. consumer price data, but the spike in annual inflation to its highest in more than three decades suggests the hiatus could be a short one.
The October inflation report released on Nov. 10 was always going to be a biggie, potentially pivotal for the Fed in respect of when it starts raising interest rates and by how much over the coming years.
It didn't disappoint. The headline rate of annual inflation jumped to 6.2%, the highest since 1990, and poured fuel on the already raging debate over whether the Fed is behind the curve.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for the week to Nov. 9 shows that funds trimmed their net short position in 10-year Treasuries futures by 1,337 contracts to 267,332 contracts ahead of the release. 
This halted the huge build up of positions betting on a higher 10-year yield. October's unwind of 296,052 contracts was the biggest monthly swing to short positions since 2005, and the second-largest since the contract's launch in the mid-1980s.
Selling momentum the week before was its strongest since March 2018, and on a two-month rolling basis, the unwind of 448,539 contracts over October and so far in November marks the most intense selloff ever.
'TRANSITORY' UNDER SCRUTINY 
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) note that uncertainty about near-term inflation remains ""unusually elevated"" as supply adjustments play out. Inflation expectations resumed their grind higher to new peaks following the latest figures too.
""Although we think that October's CPI readings overstate underlying inflationary pressures, last month's report illustrates the ongoing volatility and uncertainty,"" they wrote in a note on Monday.
Money markets did not bring forward the first of two rate hikes penciled in for next year from July, but opened up the possibility of a third 25-basis point increase toward year-end.
The renewed move up in breakeven inflation rates - the difference between yields on nominal and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities - may be increasingly difficult for policymakers to ignore.
From one-year out to 30-year maturities, all benchmark breakeven rates rose to their highest in years - in some cases in almost two decades - following the October inflation data. 
A growing phalanx of leading former government and central bank officials, including Larry Summers, Bill Dudley and Willem Buiter, in recent days have urged the Fed to rethink its position that it can afford to sit it out a bit longer because inflation is 'transitory'. 
While funds eased the pressure on the 10-year part of the curve, the latest CFTC data show they increased their net short position in 5-year Treasury futures by 31,132 contracts to 407,485 contracts. That is the biggest net short in a year.
On the other hand, they cut their net short 2-year Treasury futures position for a third week, by 46,371 contracts to 16,737. That is the smallest net short since late August. 

This lack of a cohesive move across the curve highlights the uncertainty hanging over the market, but funds appear to be enjoying the fruits of rising uncertainty and volatility.

The Paris-based group posted a current operating profit of 1.14 billion euros ($1.3 billion), just above analysts' 1.13 billion estimate and rising above pre-pandemic levels.
For the same period last year, Bouygues posted a core profit of just 681 million euros.
Its construction businesses benefited from major road contracts in Canada and Madagascar, while Bouygues Telecom added mobile and broadband customers, boosting sales.
The group, which is planning a merger of TF1 with its rival M6, reported gains in audience market share in key age brackets as well as strong demand for TV advertising.
Chief Executive Oliver Roussat told reporters he was ""rather confident"" the French regulator would approve the tie-up when it rules next October, the decision hanging in part on the nature of the markets retained by the joint group.
The planned merger would combine France's two biggest private broadcasters and see the joint entity control three-quarters of the country's TV advertising market.
EXPLODING COSTS
Analysts noted the ""small"" beats to consensus forecasts, but the group's net profit was slightly below estimates as it accounted for costs of operations such as its planned acquisition of Equans.
Bouygues earlier in November agreed to buy the services arm of energy group Engie in a deal that would be its largest ever acquisition and would make its new Energies & Services segment its largest business division.
Roussat said the company had also faced spiralling raw materials costs, from steel prices to freight from China.
""Costs for journeys have literally exploded,"" he said. ""In some cases the costs have gone up eight or nine-fold.""

However, Roussat said Bouygues was able to soften the blow by passing on costs on its short-term contracts, while some longer-term deals included provisions for inflation.

(Reuters) -Tobacco group Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) on Tuesday said 2022 would be another year of reorganisation after it posted a higher-than-expected rise in full-year profits, aided by increased cigarette prices and smaller losses in its e-cigarettes business. 
Chief Executive Stefan Bomhard has been trying to steady the business after years of sluggish growth and market share losses. He laid out a five-year turnaround plan in January to take Imperial back to its cigarette-selling roots and focus on five markets https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/imperial-brands-focus-top-five-cigarette-markets-2021-01-27 that generate nearly three quarters of its profit.
On Tuesday, the former boss of car dealer Inchcape (OTC:INCPY), said he was seeing ""encouraging early progress,"" pointing to an arrest in aggregate market share declines in its priority markets, which fell only 2 basis points this year compared to 17 basis points last year.
He also highlighted a more than 50% reduction in losses in its next generation products (NGP) business - e-cigarettes, tobacco-heating products and oral nicotine - helped by exits from markets such as Japan and Russia.
Bomhard, however, said 2022 would see Imperial making further changes to strengthen ""the foundations"" of its five-year plan. This would include, further internal business re-organisation and significant investments in marketing and sales, mainly in the second half of the year. 
The higher investments will result in adjusted operating profit growing slightly slower than net revenue growth in fiscal 2022. Net revenue growth is anticipated to be similar to that in 2021.
Losses in its NGP business, which were 138 million pounds ($185.58 million) in fiscal 2021, are also expected to be around the same level in 2022 as the company invests in market trials in countries including the Czech Republic and Greece. 
The Bristol-based company's shares were up 1.35% at the open. The stock is up nearly 4% so far this year. 
The maker of Gauloises and West cigarettes reported organic adjusted group revenue of 7.59 billion pounds ($10.20 billion), up 1.4% in constant currencies, for the full year ended Sept. 30. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 247.1 pence, above the 244.5 pence analysts had forecast.

408,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 03:30AM ET</span>",Swiss bourse to allow SPACS from Dec. 6,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACS) can be listed and traded on Switzerland's exchange from Dec. 6, Swiss bourse SIX said on Tuesday.
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to acquire a private company, which then becomes public. It serves as an alternative for companies looking to enter public markets and allows more certainty in terms of the valuation a firm can receive on the deal.
Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) earlier this year had asked bourse operator SIX to revise its listing rules for SPACs before introducing the new financing instrument.
SIX on Tuesday laid out new standards for SPAC listings, saying authorisation from all relevant authorities had now been obtained. Other bourses such as the Singapore exchange have relaxed rules to allow SPACs as a phenomenon that started off in the United States has gone global.
SPACs would principally be subject to the same requirements as other listed companies, SIX said, but would need to meet certain additional conditions and disclosure standards to help protect investors. 
These included information regarding founders' economic interests in the company, an escrow on the money raised and a three-year maximum limit for the SPAC to achieve its targeted merger or acquisition. There are also further rules and disclosures regarding the company's merger or de-listing, or so-called ""de-SPAC,"" including a lockup agreement barring directors and managers from selling shares for six months. 
SIX said authorisation from all relevant authorities had now been obtained.

""It's positive for the Swiss financial center that FINMA, in cooperation with stock exchange operator SIX, is now enabling the listing of SPACs as a new alternative,"" said Gregor Greber, co-founder of VERAISON Capital which earlier this year laid out ambitions to launch Switzerland's first SPAC.
The firm would now assess the regulation in greater details before forming an evaluation of the specific rules, Gerber said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Tuesday, boosted by strong results from corporate giants Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and supported by positive mood music from a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
At 3:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.1%.
The major equity indices in Europe received a largely positive handover from Asia, with the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong up over 1%, as the leaders of the U.S. and China met virtually in the closest communication between the two countries’ leaders since Biden took office in January.
Also helping the mood was positive quarterly news from Vodafone, with the mobile group raising its forecast for this year's free cash flow after a strong first half, driven by a good performance in Germany, its largest market. Its stock jumped 4.8%.
Diageo stock rose 2.4% after the world’s largest spirits maker forecast stronger sales growth for 2023-2025 of between 5% and 7%, compared with the 4% to 6% growth during 2017-2019.
Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) stock rose 1.5% after the tobacco group reported a slight uptick in its full-year sales, aided by higher cigarette prices that more than offset a decline in volumes.
Still, any gains are likely to be limited in Europe Tuesday as the continent again starts to restrict activity to bring the seasonal rise in Covid-19 cases under control. Additionally, tensions are mounting in Ukraine, with the U.S. warning that Russia is massing troops at the border and NATO stating it would be prepared to support the sovereignty of the country.   
On the data front, the U.K employment rate fell to 4.3% in September, from 4.5% the month before, while the October claimant count dropped almost 15,000, a sign that the end of the government's furlough scheme has not led to any dramatic deterioration in the labor market.
Later in the session sees the release of third-quarter employment and GDP readings for the Eurozone.
Crude prices rebounded Tuesday after recent losses, with attention likely to focus Tuesday on the release of U.S. crude oil data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the day.
By 3:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $80.49 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $82.91. Both contracts dropped last week on the whole, for the third week in a row.

A Joe Biden-Xi Jinping summit -- in which the Chinese leader called the U.S. president his ""old friend"" -- has put markets in a good mood.
Whether that lasts however, could depend on U.S. October retail sales figures due out later this session.
Given that personal consumption comprises almost 70% of U.S. GDP, it matters hugely whether Americans choose to spend or save. Plus, U.S. shoppers are also a key driver of the pressures besetting global supply chains.
And while the forecast is for a 1.1% rise, the risk is that inflation -- at the highest since 1990 -- will have started to dent spending. Remember, data last Friday showed consumer sentiment at a decade-low.
A clutch of Q3 earnings from retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) will add to the picture. So far, equity investors don't seem perturbed, having lifted Wall Street's retail shares index more than 10% in the past month, allowing it to outperform the broader S&P 500.
Britain meanwhile has released robust jobs figures showing the end of furlough schemes had not lifted unemployment. With a Bank of England interest rate rise now all but certain for December, sterling is inching higher .
A buoyant Asian session following the Biden-Xi summit leaves European and U.S. equities tipped to open firmer. The Chinese yuan has risen to a five-month high against the dollar.
And bond yields have inched lower, though at 1.6%, 10-year Treasury yields are still up almost 20 basis points since before last Wednesday's inflation data.
Finally, watch shares in EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)>. They have lost more than $200 billion in market cap as its CEO Elon Musk continued to offload holdings.

-Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe dismissed market pricing for a 2022 rate hike

It said Tesco's sales rose 0.4% year-on-year in the 12 weeks to Nov. 6, increasing its market share by 0.2 percentage points to 26.6%.
In contrast smaller rivals Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons saw sales fall 3.1%, 2.4% and 4.7% respectively, and all lost market share.
NielsenIQ's data echoed figures from rival researcher Kantar last week.
Last month, Tesco reported a 16.6% jump in first half profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast despite supply chain disruption.
NielsenIQ said total UK grocery sales fell 2.0% in the four weeks to Nov. 6 versus high comparative numbers ahead of a second national COVID-19 lockdown last year.
Sales were, however, up 4.9% on the same period in 2019.
The researcher noted that in-store visits to supermarkets were up 6.5% compared with last year over the four week period, equal to 28 million more visits.

In contrast, the online share of sales fell to 12.2%, down from 12.6% in the previous four weeks.

He said such a decision would have to come from the Dubai Securities and Exchange Higher Committee chaired by Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai.
The Dubai government earlier this month announced that it plans to list 10 state-linked companies as part of a goal to boost stock market activity.
Emirates did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The listing plans are aimed at making Dubai a more competitive market compared with bigger bourses in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Abu Dhabi that are attracting larger listings and strong liquidity.
Speculation over the potential listing of Emirates, Dubai's flagship carrier, has been going on for over a decade.
In 2007, al-Maktoum had said Emirates intended to go public. At the time, the airline's President Tim Clark said an IPO by the company should value it between $20 billion and $30 billion.
Emirates got a further 2.5 billion dirhams ($681 million) in state support in the first half of the year, the airline said earlier this month, as it announced first-half losses had halved.

The airline posted a loss of 5.8 billion dirhams ($1.6 billion) for the April-September period, down from a 12.6 billion-dirham loss it reported for the same period last year.

Listed as early as February 2014, the ETF has achieved returns of 30.54%, the company said in the statement. 
The AUM explosion in CSOP's China bond ETF comes as FTSE Russell started last month to include Chinese government bonds to its flagship global index.
It also comes as China successfully sold offshore sovereign bonds in Hong Kong recently, highlighting foreign confidence in China despite its economic slowdown, and the country's real estate debt troubles that roiled Chinese dollar bond market.
The spread between China's 10-year treasury bonds and their U.S. counterparts has narrowed over the past year, but remains attractive to yield-seeking global investors, at around 1.3 percentage points. 
""The China onshore bonds offer a higher yield with a relatively lower exchange rate volatility compared to other major economies,"" CSOP Asset Management said in the statement.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore Airlines Ltd expects to resume Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX flights before the end of the year, a senior executive said on Tuesday, in a positive sign for the model's return in Asia.
The city-state's aviation regulator approved 737 MAX flights in September, more than two years after they were grounded following two deadly crashes.
But Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) has not returned them to service yet because it needs the green light from other countries to fly the 737 MAX in their airspace and land the plane. 
""We certainly hope it will be as soon as possible,"" Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Lee Lik Hsin told reporters of the planned return. ""We definitely expect that it will be before this year is out.""
India, Malaysia, Australia and Japan are among other Asian countries that have approved the plane's return to service, while China and Indonesia are among those that have not. 
China's aviation regulator, however, has told airlines it is satisfied that design changes could resolve safety problems, Reuters reported on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-satisfied-with-boeing-737-max-changes-seeks-industry-feedback-document-2021-11-14, signalling it is closer to lifting the ban.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said last month the company was working toward gaining Chinese approvals by the end of the year.
Singapore Airlines has six 737 MAX planes in its fleet and another 31 on order to be used for flights around Asia.
The initial six planes were previously flown by regional brand SilkAir, which has since been folded into the more premium parent airline.
Singapore Airlines unveiled on Tuesday new lie-flat seats in the 737 MAX business class - a rarity for a narrowbody plane - as part of a S$230 million ($169.94 million) investment in cabin products.
It has also installed in-flight entertainment systems in economy class, helping to distinguish the experience from low-cost arm Scoot.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 12:56AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia's race to attract investment dogged by scepticism,"By Davide Barbuscia, Saeed Azhar and Yousef Saba
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia could have a credibility problem if it keeps shifting the goal posts for the amount of foreign investment it wants to turn its vision of a future beyond oil into a reality, financial sources and analysts said.
Five years since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched Vision 2030 to end the kingdom's dependence on fossil fuels, foreign direct investment (FDI) remains well short of targets.
    When Riyadh unveiled the plan in 2016, it aimed to boost annual FDI to nearly $19 billion by 2020 from $8 billion in 2015, but last year it was just $5.5 billion. The longer-term goal was for FDI to hit 5.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, though Riyadh did not give a dollar target.
Now the kingdom has raised the stakes again, saying it wants $100 billion in annual FDI by 2030, a new goal that many analysts consider overambitious.
""(It) does raise eyebrows as to how it looks quite unattainable, particularly that over the past four quarters FDI has totalled $18.6 billion and the total FDI inflow since the start of 2011 is only equal to $92.2 billion,"" said Capital Economics economist James Swanston.
To be consistent with its GDP target, the $100 billion goal means the economy would have to expand by 150% to reach $1.75 trillion by 2030 - a level that would have made Saudi Arabia the world's ninth biggest economy last year, behind Italy and ahead of Canada, South Korea and Russia.
To be sure, the years following Vision 2030's launch have not been helpful for FDI. A purge of the Saudi business elite in 2017 and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 deterred private investment. Then the pandemic struck.
But analysts say the kingdom, and its grand reform plan, may soon start to lose credibility in the eyes of investors. 
""Low year-on-year inward FDI levels will eventually stop being perceived optimistically as room for Saudi Arabia to improve and instead beg the question: what's going on here?"" said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
    'FIXING THE SYSTEM' 
    Saudi authorities say much of the plan is still in its initial phases, which consist mostly of regulations and planning, and money will increasingly start pouring into the kingdom over the next few years.
Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih said the FDI numbers were already improving.
    ""We are fixing the system, we are preparing the deals, we are engaging companies,"" he told Reuters. ""A lot of our transactions are being prepared.""
    In the first half of 2021 - excluding the leasing of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s oil pipelines - FDI rose 33% from the same period in 2020 and was already above targets for this year as a whole, he said.
At Saudi Arabia's annual ""Davos in the Desert"" Future Investment Initiative last month, several memoranda of understanding were signed but hopes of a major investment announcement were dashed. 
Electric carmaker Lucid, for example, which is majority owned by the Saudi sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF) and headquartered in Silicon Valley, did not announce a much-anticipated plan to build a factory in the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia did launch a national infrastructure fund, touting it as a strategic partnership with the world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), but the U.S. firm is advising Riyadh rather than committing capital.
    ""Saudi wealth remains attractive to foreign asset managers. Wall Street titans praised the local economy on stage, signed lucrative deals and walked away without committing any of their own capital. Speaks volumes,"" said a senior banker in the Gulf.
    A BlackRock spokesperson said it had a consulting assignment with the fund, which would be entirely financed by the National Development Fund, a government body, and would then aim to attract capital from other investors.
    ""It is certainly possible that BlackRock could be amongst these providers of external capital,"" the spokesperson said.
    'NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT'
    In a sign of its desire to attract more investors, Saudi Arabia issued an ultimatum this year that foreign firms must set up their regional headquarters in the country by the end of 2023, or risk losing out on government contracts.
    Saudi Arabia has a much larger consumer base than regional neighbours and international firms operating in the Gulf may not want to miss out on lucrative opportunities arising from its plans for economic transformation.
    Saudi authorities announced at the investment forum that they had licensed 44 international companies to set up regional headquarters in the capital Riyadh.
    But ultimatums, combined with abrupt changes in trade deals and taxation regimes, are perceived as another sign of the kingdom's unpredictable policies. Many Gulf executives believe firms will find workarounds to stay in Dubai, which has a more developed market and a less conservative society.
    Forum attendees speaking on condition of anonymity said there were lingering worries about regulations and taxes as well as high operating costs and a lack of skilled local workers.
The Saudi investment ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the criticisms.
""The Saudi business environment is still notoriously difficult to navigate as a foreign investor"", said Swanston.
""In terms of trying to attain some credibility to the investment goals of Vision 2030 it would be fairly crucial for Saudi to get some real commitments from firms and foreign investors,"" he said. 
    'COUNTRY WITHIN A COUNTRY'
    Progress on NEOM, Vision 2030's $500 billion signature project https://reut.rs/3qtvm5V, also remains difficult to assess, adding to concerns about the kingdom's financial transparency https://reut.rs/3HfLv53. 
    The planned megacity in the desert, announced in 2017 and backed by PIF, is studying its economic and legislative framework, NEOM https://www.neom.com/en-us Chief Executive Nadhmi al-Nasr told Reuters.
    Asked how many contracts had been awarded, or how much had been spent, he declined to give detailed answers.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, nearly tripled its holdings of U.S.-listed stocks to $43.45 billion in the third quarter, adding shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).
Its U.S.-listed stock holdings in the quarter ended Sept. 30 increased from nearly $16 billion in the prior quarter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Other stocks it bought included Just Eat Takeaway.com and Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP).
The PIF, which manages $430 billion in assets, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia's plans to transform the economy by creating new sectors and diversifying revenues away from oil. 
The PIF also owns a 62.72% stake in electric car company Lucid, which has a market value of about $71 billion, a significant boost in value from the end of September.
""The Q3 figure is indeed significantly larger than Q2, but most of the increase is due to Lucid Motors' IPO in July,"" said Diego Lopez, managing director at Global SWF, an industry data specialist.
""If you isolate the effect of Lucid, the U.S. equity holdings increased only 11%, from $15.9 billion to $17.7 billon.""
Lucid’s listing in July was a huge dividend for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, which invested more than $1 billion in the company in 2018 for a substantial stake and invested more in February. The PIF also owns a 3.75% stake in ride-sharing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).
The PIF is pursuing a two-pronged strategy, building an international portfolio of investments while also investing locally in projects that will help reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil.
""While PIF's strategy in 2020 seemed to be focused on short-term gains, we’ve seen a change in 2021, with only one divestment so far,"" Lopez said, adding that the focus is moving towards private partnerships.

PIF has also invested $45 billion in Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s inaugural $100 billion technology fund.
The PIF has boosted its firepower from several funding sources in recent years, including loans and a $40 billion transfer from central bank reserves last year.

(Reuters) -A month after announcing the appointment of former TIAA chief Roger Ferguson as its vice-chairman, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) said on Monday that commitments to his prior employer prevented him from joining the firm. 
The private-equity firm had announced Ferguson's appointment in October, less than six months after he left his position at asset manager Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA) in May.
Apollo, however, said Ferguson would not be taking up the new job.
""Roger recently informed us that he has certain ongoing commitments with his prior employer and they are preventing him from working with us at this time,"" a spokesperson for Apollo said in statement.
""We think very highly of Roger and wish him all the best.""
Ferguson declined to comment.
The reversal comes as Apollo has been making high-profile hires to shore up its corporate governance since the departure of co-founder and former chief executive Leon Black after an investigation of his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

Apollo had named Jay Clayton, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as its chairman in March.
Ferguson, 70, served as Federal Reserve vice chairman between 1999 and 2006, prior to joining TIAA. He sits on the boards of several corporate and non-profit organizations.

Earnings at the U.S. arm of Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), have been under pressure from the COVID-19 fallout and higher costs since U.S. sanctions cut its access to Venezuelan oil.
The refiner is battling possible seizure by creditors seeking to collect on unpaid debts incurred by PDVSA and Venezuela.
Citgo reported a third-quarter loss of $4 million on weaker marketing margins and outages, which reduced its crude throughput to 85% from 87% in the second quarter. The company suffered a loss of $248 million in the year-ago period due to slack demand for fuel amid coronavirus lockdowns. 
Refined product exports rose to 136,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 132,000 bpd in the second quarter and 114,000 bpd a year ago, the company said. 
""While our quarterly results were challenged despite an improved market environment, we are working to address operational issues,"" Chief Executive Officer Carlos Jorda said in a statement.
""Increased mobility is creating more demand for our products ... I'm confident we are taking the necessary steps to finish 2021 strong,"" he added.
Jorda, Citgo legal executive Jack Lynch and Sam Wilhelm, president of a Citgo parent board, were named directors of its board. The three will help steer the company during negotiations between its parent boards and creditors. 
Full-year capital spending will be $425 million, down from a $568 million budget at the start of the year. Some savings came in after shifting a plant overhaul into next year, it said. 

Since it severed ties with its parent, PDVSA, in the aftermath of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, Citgo has been controlled by boards appointed by Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Guaido.
Luis Giusti, a Venezuelan businessman and current board member, was elected chairman of the seven-person board. He replaced Jose Ramon Pocaterra, who remains a director.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China Telecom Corp Ltd's U.S. subsidiary asked a U.S. appeals court on Monday to block the decision of the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the telecommunication company's authorization to operate in the United States.
China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Americas was ordered on Oct. 26 by the FCC to discontinue U.S. services by early January after the U.S. regulator cited national security concerns.
The largest Chinese telecommunications company told the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on Monday it must notify customers of the decision by Dec. 4 and said without a temporary halt to the FCC action, it ""will be forced to cease significant operations, irreparably harming its business, reputation, and relationships.""
The FCC found that China Telecom ""is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government and is highly likely to be forced to comply with Chinese government requests without sufficient legal procedures subject to independent judicial oversight.""
China Telecom argued the FCC should have first held an administrative hearing and it noted the agency considered action for 18 months, arguing the FCC has offered no evidence ""of any imminent threat.""
The FCC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China Telecom, which has had authorization to provide telecommunications services for 20 years in the United States, served more than 335 million subscribers worldwide as of 2019, according to a Senate report, and also provides services to Chinese government facilities in the United States. It told the court the FCC action would force it ""to end its entire resold mobile resale service in the U.S.""
The company added it ""is actively negotiating an arrangement with another service provider that would allow it to seamlessly transfer its mobile service customers to the other provider.""
In March, the FCC began efforts to revoke authorization for China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Americas, Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide U.S. telecommunications services.
In May 2019, the FCC voted unanimously to deny state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, the right to provide U.S. services.

Last year, the FCC designated Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) as national security threats to communications networks.
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law, including Huawei, ZTE, Hytera Communications Corp Ltd, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co.

Sandrock has been the face of Biogen's controversial drug Aduhelm, which was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June for its ability to remove sticky deposits of another protein called amyloid beta - a likely contributor to Alzheimer's. 

Many experts have questioned the FDA'S rationale for approving the drug without more definitive proof of benefit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Monday it will not rewrite the first-ever standards regulating greenhouse gas emissions from airplanes finalized in the last days of former President Donald Trump's administration.
President Joe Biden had directed the EPA in January to consider whether to rewrite the airplane emissions rules, which face a legal challenge from 12 states and three environmental groups that say the rules do not go far enough.
Instead, the Biden administration said on Monday, it will press for ambitious new international emissions standards at the upcoming round of international negotiations in February at the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
Joe Goffman, the acting head of the EPA Air and Radiation office, told Reuters in an interview Monday, that it was important to work with the international community and to move quickly on the next round of emissions talks.
""We could have really achieved a Pyrrhic victory by tightening the rule and then finding the aviation industry avoided complying by certifying their engines via other governments,"" Goffman said.
Liz Jones, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that sued, said ""the Biden administration has taken climate hypocrisy and delay to new heights.... The EPA twiddled its thumbs for nine months before deciding it would rather defend a do-nothing rule than set any meaningful limits on aircraft emissions.""
The states said in February the regulation's greenhouse gas emission standards ""by EPA’s own analysis, will fail to reduce the emissions of any aircraft, and will prompt no action at all by manufacturers to reduce aircraft emissions."" 
They argue the EPA should have considered that ""minority and low-income communities are disproportionately located near airports and exposed to greater criteria and hazardous air pollutants from aircraft takeoff and landing emissions, which more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards could have reduced.""
The new rules apply to new-type designs as of January 2020 and to in-production airplanes or those with amended type certificates starting in 2028.
Goffman said rewriting the rule ""would have been disruptive for our industry, it would have been disruptive for the international process and in the three-dimensional world not gained us anything.""
Airplanes have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. In 2016, ICAO agreed on global airplane emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which both endorsed the rules.
The ICAO emissions standards effort began under former President Barack Obama's administration, and was finalized under Trump in January.

Boeing argued the EPA should not rewrite the rules, saying ""attempts to overturn regulation directly aligned with successful cooperative international efforts to combat climate change, supported by more than 190 countries, will only discourage future international agreements.""
Last week, the United States set a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050. The White House said in September it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030, as airlines facing pressure from environmental groups to lower their carbon footprint pledged to use more sustainable aviation fuel.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on Monday launched a sale of its oil and gas properties in the first major U.S. shale field, a spokesperson confirmed, as part of a portfolio reshuffling to focus on more lucrative assets.
The top U.S. oil producer set a goal three years ago of raising $15 billion from asset sales, and put several U.S. and international assets on the market as energy prices have recovered from the pandemic-induced slump. 
It will open a data room on Thursday for its Barnett Shale holdings that include 2,700 wells across about 182,000 acres in North Texas, home of the first horizontally drilled shale wells. Exxon spokesperson Sarah Nordin confirmed the sale process. Production operations will continue normally during the marketing process, Nordin said. There has been no agreement reached on a sale and no buyer was identified, she said.
The producing properties are valued at between $400 million and $500 million, according a person familiar with the matter. U.S. gas prices are up 75% year to date, settling at $5.01 per million British thermal units on Monday. 
Bids are due Dec. 21 and Exxon aims to close any sale in January. The properties' shale gas production has declined by half since 2016, to around 227 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) in the first half of this year, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters. 

The wells were among natural gas properties Exxon last year said it wanted to sell. It put about 5,000 natural gas wells in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas on the block in August.
Exxon, which suffered a historic $22.4 billion loss in 2020, is selling assets in Asia, Africa and Europe as it as focuses on production ventures in Guyana, offshore Brazil and the Permian Basin.

LONDON (Reuters) -BNP Paribas is working with advisers to assess a sale of its U.S. arm Bank of the West as it seeks to retreat from the American retail banking market after struggling to compete with larger and better capitalised rivals, sources told Reuters.
The French lender, which overtook Britain's HSBC last year to become Europe's largest bank by assets, is looking to part ways with its San Francisco-based retail banking subsidiary in a deal that could value it at about $15 billion, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are preparing the business for a sale and have been working closely with BNP to gauge interest from prospective bidders, the sources said.
Discussions are still at an early stage and no deal is certain, they said.
Shares in BNP rose as much as 5.5% to 62.55 euros after the Reuters story and were 3.4% higher in early afternoon trading.
JPMorgan was first to secure a mandate from BNP during the summer, one of the sources said, having recently represented Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) in the $11.6 billion sale of its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) - a deal BNP hopes to replicate.
BNP was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Bank of the West, with $99.2 billion of assets as of June 30, ranks as BNP's biggest business outside Europe. 
A sale would give Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé cash to invest on the continent where the European Central Bank is urging the region's lenders to merge as they have lagged their U.S. and Chinese rivals in profitability and size since the 2008 financial crisis, the sources said.
While centred on California, the 147-year old Bank of the West has retail operations in 19 U.S. West and Midwest states. It was bought by BNP in 1979 and subsequently merged with its local subsidiary, the French Bank of California (FBC).
Bank of the West sells a range of retail banking products and services to individuals, small businesses and corporate clients with a strong presence in specialised financing areas, such as agribusiness and farming.
BIDDING FIELD
To secure a successful sale of the business, BNP would have to overcome a number of challenges, the sources noted.
U.S. President Joe Biden has called for more scrutiny of bank mergers, while the departure nL1N2RZ1IC of Randal Quarles as the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision and uncertainty over Jerome Powell's future as chair has cast doubt on banking consolidation.
Dealmakers, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, said this leadership void has created an effective hold on the approval of large bank acquisitions by the Fed, making it difficult for bank boards to sanction new transactions.
""BNP needs to find a partner who's willing to fight hard to win regulatory approval,"" the first source said.
The French lender has long seen PNC as an ideal suitor for Bank of the West, and its sale efforts were emboldened by the purchase price PNC paid for BBVA's U.S. business, valuing it at 20 times its 2019 earnings, the source said.
But with PNC now busy integrating its latest acquisition, BNP is left with a small pool of potential buyers, which include Canadian banks and some regional U.S. players.
Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal are seen as possible suitors alongside Ohio-based KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), two of the sources said.
TD Bank, with retail operations along the U.S. East Coast, has proceeds available from the $26 billion sale of broker-dealer TD Ameriprise to  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said in May the bank was open for M&A opportunities which made financial sense, with a focus on its existing footprint.
BMO executives have expressed a desire to grow the bank's U.S. presence and would be in a position to add cash to finance a possible deal while KeyCorp would instead need to pursue an all-stock transaction.

Royal Bank of Canada - which owns City National Bank, the ninth-largest bank in California by deposits - could also express interest in Bank of the West, one of the sources said.
PNC and KeyCorp declined to comment while TD, BMO and RBC were not immediately available.

Burry told CNBC in October that he was no longer betting against Tesla and that his position, which was disclosed earlier this year, was just a trade.
Put options give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future.
Among other positions he exited were put options on 91,900 shares of Alphabet Inc and 1.9 million shares of the iShares 20 year plus Treasury ETF. 
Burry also exited a put position on 235,500 shares of ARK Innovation, the ETF run by star stockpicker Cathie Wood which was the top-performing U.S. equity fund last year thanks to its bets on high-growth companies that rallied during the early stages of the pandemic. 
The $20.5 billion fund has slipped this year, however, and is down 4.8% for the year to date despite the 24.7% rally in the S&P 500.
It was not clear how Burry's bearish bets on Tesla and the others fared, given that regulatory filings do not require the disclosure of options strikes, purchase prices and expiration dates.

At the same time, Burry added a new long position in  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), oil drilling equipment company Now Inc and biotech company Scynexis Inc, according to SEC filings. 
Each company rose in afternoon trading on Thursday, while the broad S&P 500 index was flat.

LONDON (Reuters) - British electric truck startup Tevva said on Tuesday it had raised $57 million in its latest funding round to ramp up production at its new London plant and deliver its first vehicles to customers by the end of 2022.
Tevva has now raised more than $90 million.
The British truck maker will have two zero-emission 7.5 tonne (7,500 kg) models available for customers - a battery electric model with a range of 160 miles (257 km), and an electric truck with a small reserve hydrogen fuel cell to boost its range to 310 miles if needed. 
Tevva Chief Executive Asher Bennett told Reuters the backup hydrogen fuel cell would provide customers with greater flexibility in the event any of their trucks need to travel further.
As hydrogen fuelling infrastructure is still in its infancy, Tevva can provide the fuel as a service to customers.
Bennett told Reuters the company expected most customers would opt for the reserve hydrogen fuel cell because they were wary of the limited range of a pure electric model.
""We understand how the truck world operates and the huge risk of that range limit is too difficult for a lot of companies to overcome,"" he said.
Facing looming fossil-fuel vehicle bans, truck fleets are looking for viable zero-emission options to deliver goods to businesses and consumers. 
UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, is currently using 15 test model trucks from Tevva.

Tevva intends to produce several hundred trucks by the end of 2022 and targets production of 3,000 trucks annually by 2023.
Bennett said the company planned a series of small factories to make trucks close to customers. Once Tevva's London plant is operating at scale, he said the company would look at further sites in North America and the European Union.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>","Washington state, in $95 billion opioid trial, blames drug distributors for crisis","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Washington state's attorney general on Monday argued in court that three large drug distributors' excessive shipments of pain pills helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, calling it the ""worst man-made public health crisis in history,"" as the state sought to recoup an estimated $95 billion.
The argument came at the start of a trial in the state's bid to recover more money from distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp than it would have received in a $26 billion nationwide settlement.
Lawyers for the state, led by Attorney General Bob Ferguson, said the companies fell short of their legal obligations to operate systems to prevent the diversion of pain pills from legitimate uses and to stop suspicious orders of opioids from going to pharmacies.
They did so while shipping 3.8 billion opioid doses into Washington from 2006 to 2018, the state's attorneys told King County Superior Court Judge Michael Scott in Seattle, who is hearing the case without a jury. 
The state's lawyers argued the companies' failures contributed to a crisis that led to 10,800 opioid overdose deaths in Washington since 2006.
""Indeed, we know they were aware of the harms flowing from their conduct because in private correspondence company executives mocked individuals suffering the painful affects of opioid dependence,"" Ferguson said in his opening statement.
As one example, the state's lawyers displayed a 2011 email in which an AmerisourceBergen employee shared a parody theme song to that of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" TV show that described how people drove to obtain drugs at Florida pill mills.
""A Bevy of Pillbillies!"" the email said.
Defense lawyers acknowledged the epidemic was serious but said the companies bore no responsibility for it, saying opioid misuse was instead usually due to drug traffickers and unused opioids sitting in medicine cabinets.
Enu Mainigi, Cardinal Health's lawyer, said shipments grew not because of any corporate misconduct but instead due to a rising number of opioid prescriptions as the medical community and regulators, starting in the 1990s, embraced opioids to treat pain.
""The consensus was that pain needed to be treated more aggressively and opioids were the right way to do it,"" she said.
'NO CONNECTION'
AmerisourceBergen lawyer Robert Nicholas, citing a government watchdog report, said the company reported all suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration but that agency failed to act on them.
""They're acting as if our reporting suspicious orders would have stopped the crisis in its tracks,"" he said. ""That's simply not the case. There's no connection.""
Washington is seeking $38.2 billion to fund treatment and other programs and billions more in penalties and forfeited profits. The distributors, who deny wrongdoing, say the state wants a ""wildly inflated recovery"" of more than $95 billion.
More than 3,300 lawsuits by largely state and local governments have been filed seeking to hold those and other companies responsible for a drug abuse crisis the U.S. government says led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
Washington state would have been eligible for $527.5 million if it had joined a proposed $26 billion global deal, under which the distributors would pay up to $21 billion and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) would pay $5 billion.
Ferguson, a Democrat, has criticized the settlement as ""not nearly good enough,"" saying the nearly $30 million on average the state and its communities would receive annually was insufficient to address the devastation caused by the epidemic.
The state became one of eight not to participate in the distributors' nationwide accord and opted to proceed to trial.
Plaintiffs in some of the other opioid cases have recently faced setbacks pursuing nuisance claims.

Oklahoma's top court on Tuesday overturned a $465 million judgment against J&J, and a California judge this month ruled in favor of four drugmakers in a case brought by several large counties. 
Closing arguments were delivered Monday in an opioid trial in Ohio involving three pharmacy chains.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes closed out Monday's session near the unchanged mark as rising Treasury yields dented the appetite for technology stocks, while Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares advanced on signs of demand for its freighter aircraft.
The technology sector, down 0.11%, was among the biggest drags on the day as U.S. Treasury yields moved higher, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note touching its highest level since Oct. 27. Higher Treasury yields tend to weigh on high-growth areas such as tech, as they discount future earnings from the sector. 
Bank stocks, which benefit from climbing yields, advanced with bond yields on the rise as investors positioned for the potential effects of the Federal Reserve's tapering of its massive asset purchases and ahead of a scheduled sale of new 20-year bonds later in the week.
""Wall Street is completely fixated over what is happening in the bond market. We are starting to see yields are rising and that will, ultimately, signal that there's a lot more nervousness that the Fed could be a little bit late to the game on delivering a rate hike and will be forced to react a lot quicker, given the inflationary pressures,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. 
""You're seeing mixed trade right now because, while a lot of traders are focused on whether these inflationary pressures will keep Treasuries or rates climbing, you're also seeing manufacturing improve in the Empire State and a lot more optimism from abroad.""
Data on Monday showed manufacturing activity in New York surged to 30.9 in November, well above the prior 19.8 reading and 21.2 estimate.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.86 points, or 0.04%, to 36,087.45, the S&P 500 lost 0.05 point, or flat, to 4,682.80 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.11 points, or 0.04%, to 15,853.85.
Focus this week will be on earnings reports from several major retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M) Their results will round off an upbeat third-quarter earnings season, which helped push Wall Street to new highs. 
Retail sales data for October is also due on Tuesday, and is expected to reveal signs of any impact inflation has had on consumer spending. 
 Boeing Co , up 5.49%, was the top boost to the Dow Jones Industrials as the stock closed at a three-month high after Emirates airline announced an order for two 777 Freighters and as Saudi Arabian Airlines was in talks with the planemaker for a wide-body jet order.
The Dubai Airshow event is the first major aerospace conference since the pandemic decimated passenger air travel, with investors watching to see how the industry is coping with new dynamics.
Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell 1.94% after Chief Executive Elon Musk engaged in a dispute with Bernie Sanders as the U.S. senator demanded the wealthy pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.
Tesla's declines follow a steep drop of 15.4% last week after Musk offloaded a combined $6.9 billion worth of shares in the company.
The S&P materials sector, down 0.46%, was among the worst-performing sectors for the session on signs of weakness in China's property sector, a key driver of global metal demand, which weighed on miners.
 Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) jumped 14.28% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after activist investor Mantle Ridge LP revealed a 5.7% stake in the discount retailer.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 129 new highs and 127 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.56 billion shares, compared with the 10.96 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 07:17PM ET</span>",Activist investors raise bets on retailers and other consumer cyclicals-filings,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors who prod companies to perform better made new and bigger bets on consumer cyclical stocks including retailers, a food service distributor and carmakers during the third quarter amid signs of stronger growth early in the year.
Activist investment firm Jana Partners bought 4.6 million shares in Macy's (NYSE:M), according to a new regulatory filing, and is urging the retailer to spin off its e-commerce business.
Sachem Head Capital Management boosted its stake in U.S. Foods Holding by 67% to 11.4 million shares, and Mantle Ridge bought 12.7 million shares in discount retailer  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) and said in a filing last week that it wants management to take steps to raise the share price.
Engine No. 1, the sustainability-focused firm that forced ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to add three newcomers to its board this year, raised its holdings in car makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by 78% and General Motors (NYSE:GM) by 20%, according to filings made on Monday.
The firms increased their exposure to these types of stocks, sometimes called consumer discretionary stocks, as shoppers were ready to spend stimulus checks, confident the worst of the pandemic would soon be over.
More recently, some investors have grown concerned that rising inflation could dampen spending in some areas, as rising costs on everything from gasoline to groceries fanned the biggest annual consumer price gain in more than three decades.
Expectations for fresh travel and more dining out also prompted managers like Sachem Head's Scott Ferguson to boost his holding of ride sharing company Uber (NYSE:UBER) by 230% to 5.1 million shares, the filing showed.
Similarly Maverick Capital, not known as an activist investor, raised its stake in Uber by 10% to 2.4 million shares, while PointState Capital owned 3.9 million shares of Uber, marking a 453% increase.
Cinctive Capital Management boosted its stake in General Motors by 323,284 shares held, the filings show.
Money managers are required to report their stakes in U.S.-based companies 45 days after the end of the quarter and while the data are often backward-looking, they are closely watched for investment trends.
Many of the consumer cyclical stocks have performed well this year but some so-called activist investors expect to reap more gains by pushing management to pursue dramatic changes.

At Macy's, which like other retailers had to temporarily shutter stores during the height of COVID-19, management could create a digital goldmine, Jana's Scott Ostfeld said in October when he laid out arguments to spin off the e-commerce unit.
At U.S. Foods, Sachem Head has not precisely spelled out the changes it wants to see but the company is already looking to shake up its executive suite by looking for a chief operating officer and a new chief financial officer.

(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Monday it eliminated its investment in Merck & Co and reduced its stakes in  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co, as it pared its overall stock market investments.
Berkshire also eliminated its small stakes in Organon & Co, a Merck spinoff specializing in contraception and other women's health products, and telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc (NASDAQ:LBTYA).
It disclosed new investments of $475 million in Royalty Pharma Plc, which buys drug royalties, and $99 million in flooring retailer Floor & Decor Holdings (NYSE:FND) Inc.
The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed holdings as of Sept. 30.
Shares of Royalty Pharma rose more than 5% after the market close, a common occurrence after Berkshire reveals new stakes. Royalty Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investors monitor Berkshire's investments closely to see where Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler see value. The filings do not say who bought and sold what, though Buffett generally handles larger investments.
While Berkshire ended September with $310.7 billion of equity holdings, it sold $2 billion more stocks than it bought in the third quarter, and has been a net seller for all of 2021.
About 41% of Berkshire's stock investments are in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with another 29% in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co.
The sales and Buffett's nearly six-year drought in buying large whole companies have contributed to Berkshire's boosting its cash holdings to a record https://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-results-idCAKBN2HR092 $149.2 billion, despite at least $21.9 billion of stock buybacks this year.
They have also disappointed investors who have seen Berkshire's stock price significantly lag the Standard & Poor's 500 since the end of 2018.
Berkshire's respective share stakes in AbbVie and Bristol-Myers fell 30% and 16% in the quarter.
Royalty Pharma helps fund late-stage clinical trials and product launches in exchange for future royalty streams, and sometimes buys royalties from drug developers.
Its larger revenue streams come from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VRTX) treatments for cystic fibrosis, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Tysabri for multiple sclerosis, and AbbVie's Imbruvica for various cancers.

The company's share price has recently traded about 50% above its initial public offering price in June 2020, but below where it closed on its first trading day.
Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska. It also owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's stock extended its recent selloff on Monday as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk's recent share sales of a combined $6.9 billion, as well as to his most recent tweets.
Tesla's stock ended nearly 2% lower at $1,013.39, leaving the company's market capitalization down about $207 billion since before Musk began selling shares last week.
The latest stock decline follows a Sunday dispute on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) between Musk, the world's richest person, and Bernie Sanders after the U.S. senator demanded that the wealthy pay their ""fair share"" of taxes. 
During Monday's session, Tesla traded as low as $978.60, pushing its stock market value below the $1 trillion mark on an intraday basis for the second time in four sessions. Tesla first hit the $1 trillion mark late last month. 
Graphic: U.S. car makers by stock market value https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/xmvjoreodpr/chart.png 
""Tesla shares have been sinking post the sale based on a Twitter poll last week. And Musk's Sunday tweet deriding a senior politician may add pressure on the stock in the coming weeks,"" said Kunal Sawhney, CEO of equity research firm Kalkine Group.
""By offloading shares worth billions of dollars, Elon Musk is likely to accrue a tax bill of around $15 billion."" 
Musk sold 6.36 million Tesla shares last week after floating the idea in a Twitter poll. He would need to offload about 10 million more to fulfill his pledge to sell 10% of his holdings in the electric-vehicle maker.
Fueled by thirst on Wall Street for electric vehicle makers, Tesla's stock has surged more than 140% in the past 12 months. The recent selloff has the stock at its lowest level since late October.
Also on Monday, Rivian Automotive jumped nearly 15%, with the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com-backed EV maker now up about 90% since its initial public offering last week.
Reflecting retail investors' enthusiasm, Tesla and Rivian were the most-traded stocks on Fidelity's online brokerage, with more than two buy orders for every sell order.
CHIP SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
Musk on Saturday asked a Twitter user not to ""read too much into"" PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta's comments about expecting its first delivery of Tesla Semi trucks in the fourth quarter.
""As mentioned publicly, Tesla is constrained by chip supply short-term & cell supply long-term,"" Musk tweeted. ""Not possible to produce additional vehicles in volume until both constraints are addressed.""

Tesla has weathered the pandemic and the global supply-chain crisis better than rivals, posting record revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Meanwhile, investor Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame took aim at Musk again, tweeting, ""@elonmusk borrowed against 88.3 million shares, sold all his mansions, moved to Texas, and is asking @BernieSanders whether he should sell more stock. He doesn't need cash. He just wants to sell $TSLA.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he will add legislation to boost U.S. competitiveness with China to a massive defense policy bill the Senate is due to begin considering this week, a boost for a measure that has been stalled for months in the House of Representatives.
""Our supply chain crisis needs attending to and we cannot wait,"" Schumer said in a Senate speech announcing that the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, would be amended to include the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA.
The Senate passed USICA with a strong bipartisan vote in June, but the measure never received a vote in the House of Representatives. Supporters of the bill have since been working to find a way to pass it and send it to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law.
Biden is due later on Monday to hold a virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Reuters reported on Sunday that supporters of USICA were considering adding its provisions to the NDAA. As one of the few major pieces of legislation passed every year, the NDAA often acts as a vehicle for a range of policy issues. 
That strategy does not guarantee that USICA will become law, but it increases the chances for some of its most important provisions.
The Senate passed USICA by 68-32. The measure would authorize $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and research, and an additional $54 billion to increase production and research into semiconductors and telecommunications equipment.

Once the Senate approves its version of the NDAA, Senate and House negotiators will work on a compromise between the Senate measure and a version of the bill passed by the House earlier this year.
That compromise must then pass both the House and Senate before it can be sent to Biden.

CLEVELAND (Reuters) -Lawyers for pharmacy chains including CVS and Walgreens on Monday argued they were not to blame for the U.S. opioid epidemic, as jurors prepared to consider whether to hold them responsible for the devastation the drug crisis caused in two Ohio counties.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for Lake and Trumbull counties, told a federal jury in Cleveland that a verdict in the case against CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc would have ramifications across the country.
The trial is the first the pharmacy chains have faced in thousands of lawsuits by states and local governments seeking to hold them liable for an epidemic that U.S. health officials say has led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
""You get to decide what will be the most seminal case in pharmacy history,"" Lanier said in his closing argument.
He argued that companies created a public nuisance in the form of the epidemic by failing to prevent excessive amounts of addictive pain pills from flooding the counties or by stopping bogus prescriptions from being filled.
""A pharmacy is not a gum ball machine,"" Lanier said. ""They have more responsibility than simply taking your money and getting you your pills.""
Defense lawyers countered that the companies took steps to guard against the diversion of pills and blamed others for the deadly epidemic.
""There are many, many actors who played a role in the opioid crisis: The manufacturers, government agencies, doctors, drug cartels,"" CVS attorney Eric Delinsky said.
Brian Swanson, a lawyer for Walgreens, said it had policies in place since 1997 to identify ""red flags"" of misuse and kept improving them.
""A company that's constantly updating and improving its policies is not a company acting intentionally to cause an opioid crisis,"" he told jurors.
LAWSUITS FILED NATIONWIDE 
Should the jurors find the pharmacies created a public nuisance, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster would decide how much they owe to abate, or address, it. The counties' lawyers have said the costs are potentially $1 billion for each county. 
The Ohio trial follows recent setbacks for plaintiffs pursuing some of the 3,300 opioid cases filed against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies.

Oklahoma's top court last Tuesday overturned a $465 million judgment https://www.reuters.com/business/oklahoma-court-overturns-465-million-opioid-award-against-johnson-johnson-2021-11-09 against drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and a California judge this month ruled in favor of four drugmakers in a case brought by several large counties.
Those lawsuits also accused the companies of creating a public nuisance. A similar lawsuit by Washington state against three drug distributors went to trial on Monday.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>",Analysis: Freighters to the fore as planemakers bet on trade flows,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - A pandemic-driven boom in air cargo is providing an auspicious backdrop for Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to launch new large freighters, but longer-term trends - particularly the strength of the global economic rebound - will determine whether either succeeds.
Airbus bagged its first deal for the freighter version of its A350 jetliner at the Dubai Airshow on Monday - a model the European group hopes will break Boeing's long-held dominance of the market to fly goods. 
Boeing, meantime, is working on a potential freighter variant of its 777X model, though has yet to announce a launch, with possible buyers including major cargo player Qatar Airways.
After losing two years of air passenger growth to the pandemic, the freighter market has been a rare bright spot for planemakers, as a boom in online shopping, supply chain disruptions, and a drop in passenger plane flights - which often also carry cargo in their holds - has stoked demand. 
But there are big risks associated with new models, which would only be delivered in the second half of the decade. 
These include a rapid recovery in passenger flights, companies shifting to source more goods closer to home, and a growing number of passenger jets being converted to freighters. 
There is also huge uncertainty over the strength of the economic recovery from the pandemic and the future of global trade, which was in a slump before the pandemic due to U.S.-China trade tensions that have not been resolved.
""It's not a risk-free decision,"" said Stuart Rubin, managing director aviation at consulting firm ICF of Airbus and Boeing's freighter plans.
Neither company has disclosed the cost of developing the new models.
SHORT-TERM BOOM
The shortage of passenger plane belly capacity during the pandemic sent freight rates soaring, delayed retirements of older models like MD-11s and had lessors rushing to convert older unwanted passenger planes into carrying freight.
""Freight-wise, everyone with a plane could make money at the moment,"" said Frederic Horst, managing director of Cargo Facts Consulting. ""We're seeing a lot of weird things going on that you wouldn't normally see. You're seeing 737 narrowbody freighters flying Europe to Asia."" 
Large widebody freighters like the proposed A350 and 777X usually carry denser, trade-linked products like auto parts, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals on long-haul routes from Asia to North America and Europe.
Converted passenger planes instead carry lighter, more voluminous cargo such as e-commerce packages. 
Cargo companies like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and major airlines such as Korean Air Lines and Lufthansa have also benefited from unprecedented disruptions to supply chains and soaring container shipping rates during the health crisis.
Air transport last month was around four to six times as expensive as sea freight, versus 12 to 15 times normally, said Tom Sanderson, director of product marketing at Boeing.
There are grounds for thinking some of the pandemic-driven boosts to air freight will continue. 
Airbus, for example, forecasts the e-commerce market will grow 4.7% per year over the next 20 years, compared with 2.7% for general cargo. 
""If you get a good price, ordering freighters in the current market is not really audacious,"" said independent industry adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
In the depths of the pandemic last year, Boeing, which controls 90% of the freighter market, forecast the global large widebody cargo fleet would rise to 850 planes in 2039 from 610 in 2019 due to growth in demand. 
Environmental trends are also working in favour of new, more fuel-efficient freighters. 
Boeing's soon-to-be-discontinued 747-8, as well as the 777F and 767F, cannot be produced after 2027 due to new environmental standards unless product changes are made.
Boeing has said it may apply for exemptions to the rules as one of several options under consideration for freight plans.
FADING BENEFITS 
Yet, analysts say there are also signs some of the pandemic benefits for air freight are starting to fade. 
Container rates have begun to fall as supply chain disruptions have eased and some companies bring production closer to home to avoid future shocks. 
European fashion companies are shifting manufacturing from China to places like Portugal, Turkey and North Africa, said Marco Bloemen, cargo advisory lead at Accenture (NYSE:ACN)'s Seabury Consulting.
The burgeoning market to convert 777 passenger planes into freighters - such as the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and AerCap 777-300ER programme set to produce its first freighter next year - could also limit demand for new models. 

While the converted planes will not be able to carry denser cargo as effectively as their newly built counterparts, they can ride the boom in e-commerce, said ICF's Rubin.
Emirates on Monday signed a deal with IAI to convert four 777-300ERs into freighters, citing its ability to carry high volumes of e-commerce as the key factor. The airline also ordered two more factory built 777 freighters.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Engine No. 1's head of active engagement Charlie Penner, who conceived and quarterbacked this year's successful board challenge at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) that stunned the corporate world, is leaving the sustainability-focused hedge fund. 
Penner, a partner at Engine No. 1, has informed the firm that he is resigning, the company said, confirming a Reuters report based on information from two sources familiar with the decision. He plans to continue running activist campaigns while collaborating with other large investors.
""We appreciate the tremendously valuable work Charlie put in at Engine No. 1, especially on the Exxon campaign, and we wish him well in his future endeavors,"" an Engine No. 1 spokesman said in a statement.
Engine No. 1, which had only $250 million in assets when it opened for business less than a year ago, made a big splash in May when shareholders elected three of the four directors the hedge fund nominated to the U.S. oil company's board. 
The hedge fund made an initial investment of $40 million and argued that Exxon, which is now valued at $270 billion, needed new blood in light of its poor financial performance and lack of a broad plan to address climate change. It spent $12.5 million on the campaign.
Penner joined Engine No. 1 in October 2020 as a partner and brought the idea of battling Exxon to the fund.
He ran the campaign with a team, selecting director nominees, speaking with Exxon's board, and presenting the hedge fund's case to top Exxon shareholders including Vanguard, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT).
He moved to the new firm, founded by Chris James, after 15 years at Barry Rosenstein's activist firm Jana Partners.
Other Engine No. 1 investments include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). In June the firm rolled out an exchange traded fund, betting that Main Street investors want portfolios to back environmental, social and governance proposals (ESG) on the heels of its Exxon win. 
Penner has worked on activist campaigns for more than a decade and is credited with having launched the first ever ESG focused activist campaign in 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Renaissance Technologies, Aristides Capital and Adage Capital Partners were among large U.S. hedge funds that boosted their stake or took new positions in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc last quarter, before a searing October rally that vaulted the company's market value above $1 trillion and a subsequent tumble this month. 
Renaissance added slightly more than 610,000 shares in the company, nearly quadrupling its stake, while Adage added a new position of 42,800 shares and Aristides added a new position of 8,500 shares, according to SEC disclosures.
Overall, 211 hedge funds and asset management firms added new positions in Tesla last quarter, while 116 firms closed out of their positions in the company, according data-tracking firm WhaleWisdom. 
Tesla shares surged 43.5% in October, fueled in part by the announcement of an order from car-rental company Hertz. They pared some of those gains in November, with the company's value dipping below $1 trillion on Monday as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk's recent share sales of a combined $6.9 billion.
The disclosures by each fund came in quarter-end SEC filings released Monday and do not specify whether the firms have maintained those positions. Shares of Tesla closed at $1,013.39 Monday afternoon, nearly 31% more than their Sept. 30 level of $775. 
The stock has fallen 18.5% from its Nov. 4 record high of $1,243.49, shortly before Musk announced that he was selling 10% of his stake in the company after floating the idea in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll. 
Institutional interest in Tesla has likely helped push up the company's valuation, which remains high in the face of increasing competition from startup automakers like Rivian Automotive Inc and an increasing focus on electric vehicles by established companies such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), said Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar.

Tesla trades at 130.7 times future earnings.
Even with the recent selloff in shares, ""we still think the market is assuming Tesla becomes a top-five automaker globally in annual vehicles sold and is successful in launching its high-margin autonomous driving software subscription service,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a 16-month high on Monday while U.S. stocks dipped slightly as investors searched for a clearer economic picture.
Persistent concerns that inflation may be rising more sharply and sticking around longer than originally expected weighed on Wall Street, with pessimism weighing on stocks and oil and pushing safe havens like the U.S. dollar upwards.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.04%, the S&P 500 ended flat, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.04%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 0.08%.
Investors likely will be closely watching fresh data on U.S. retail sales out on Tuesday, after a report out Friday showed consumer sentiment hitting its lowest point in a decade, due in part to inflation.
""Stocks were more or less in a holding pattern today, and after the market finished last week in the red, it could be searching for some direction,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial. ""As inflation continues to be the topic du jour, investors likely have their sights set on an update from retailers with earnings and retail sales on deck for some insight into the consumer and how they’re handling pricing pressure.""
Rising Treasury yields also helped push equity prices lower, with benchmarks hitting three-week highs as companies rushed to debt markets ahead of the holiday stretch. 
The 20-year bond yields rose 5 basis points to 2.04% while 30-year bond yields increased 5 basis points to 2.01%.
Benchmark 10-year yields gained 4 basis points to 1.62% and are up from a one-month low of 1.42% last Tuesday.
Oil prices settled somewhat after hitting a one-week low in earlier trading, ending the day in mixed territory. Crude prices had previously been pushed down by speculation that President Joe Biden's administration could tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Brent futures settled down 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $82.05 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 8 cents, or 0.1%, to $80.88.
DOLLAR LEAPS
Investor concern helped push the U.S. dollar to a 16-month high against major peers Monday, as its safe-haven status proved appealing in uncertain times.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six peers, hit 95.510 on Monday, its highest since July 2020, and was last up 0.398% at 95.394.
The dollar's surge comes after a surprise report last week showing U.S. inflation on the rise weighed down markets, as investors wondered if the Federal Reserve might be forced to raise rates sooner, and if the U.S. consumer will have to consider higher prices for longer. 
""Inflation is being driven by the unusual supply shocks tied to the restart. We expect these imbalances to resolve over the next year, but see inflation as persistent and settling at a higher level than pre-COVID,"" wrote Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) analysts in an investor note. ""Although price rises are broad based, the mix of inflation shows the unusual restart dynamics at play.""
Fellow safe-haven gold hit a five-month high earlier in the trading day, but ended up settling a touch lower, ending a seven-session winning streak.

Spot gold prices fell 0.10% to $1,862.24 an ounce.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Some 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers in U.S. film and television narrowly approved a new contract with producers, their union said on Monday.
The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which includes camera operators, make-up artists, sound technicians and others, said in a statement its members voted to ratify a new three-year contract that was tentatively agreed last month.
The voting was close, with 50.3% of members voting yes and 49.7% voting against, IATSE said.
The deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) was reached in October after the union threatened a strike that would have to shut down film and television production around the United States in the biggest stoppage since the 2007-2008 strike by Hollywood screenwriters. 
It would have hit a wide range of media companies including Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA).
The contract reduces working hours and increases pay for members who work on streaming platforms, and improves rest periods and meal breaks on TV and film sets. IATSE leaders had strongly urged members to ratify it, saying it was ""the best agreement possible.""
""The vigorous debate, high turnout, and close election, indicates we have an unprecedented movement-building opportunity to educate members on our collective bargaining process and drive more participation in our union long-term,"" IATSE President Matthew Loeb said in a statement on Monday.
The issue of long working hours was brought into sharp focus last month after Alec Baldwin fatally shot a cinematographer in an on-set accident on a low budget Western movie in New Mexico. Six of the camera crew had walked out https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/alec-baldwin-posts-crew-member-comments-disputing-chaotic-movie-set-2021-11-03 earlier in protest at working conditions.

Authorities in Santa Fe are still investigating the shooting and no charges have been brought against anyone. 
AMPTP spokesman Jarryd Gonzales welcomed the vote and the changes on improving quality of life. ""These agreements meaningfully reflect the industry’s endorsement of those priorities and keep everyone working,"" Gonzales added.

The FAA in September extended the public comment period for the draft environmental review of the proposed program in Boca Chica, Texas, to Nov. 1. The FAA received more than 17,000 written comments and 121 oral comments during two public hearings.
SpaceX, the space company led by Elon Musk, cannot launch the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle until the FAA completes its licensing process, which includes the environmental review.
Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday he appreciated the ""hard work by FAA, US Fish & Wildlife and Texas Parks & Wildlife"" in the review and ""strong local support"" for the project.

The FAA released a 151-page draft environmental review in September. The review looks at potential environmental impacts of SpaceX’s initial mission profile and reviews debris recovery, local road closures in Boca Chica and other issues.
Reuters reported in July that the FAA warned SpaceX that the agency could order it to take down a new tower because the environmental review was not complete.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has reached a settlement with California to resolve claims it concealed from warehouse workers and local health agencies the numbers of workers being infected with COVID-19, the state's attorney general said on Monday.
California accused Amazon of violating a September 2020 state ""right-to-know"" law, Assembly Bill 685, requiring that it keep workers up to date about the spread of COVID-19, and provide information about safety plans and coronavirus-related benefits.
Attorney General Rob Bonta said that by keeping tens of thousands of warehouse workers, as well as agencies in the dark, the online retailing giant left them unable to effectively track the spread of the virus.
Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to alert California warehouse workers within one day about the exact number of new COVID-19 cases in their workplaces.
The Seattle-based company will also pay $500,000 to help enforce state consumer protection laws.
Amazon did not admit wrongdoing or liability in agreeing to the settlement, which was filed with the California Superior Court in Sacramento and requires a judge's approval.
""We're glad to have this resolved and to see that the AG found no substantive issues with the safety measures in our buildings,"" Amazon spokeswoman Barbara Agrait said in an email.
At least 14 U.S. states have adopted comprehensive COVID-19 worker safety protections, the nonprofit National Employment Law Project said in June.

Amazon has face criticism elsewhere over its handling of COVID-19 in the workplace.
The company is appealing a New York state judge's refusal last month to dismiss a lawsuit by that state's Attorney General Letitia James over worker safety at two New York City fulfillment centers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE) on Monday said it agreed to buy Canadian stock exchange operator Aequitas Innovations Inc, known as NEO, for an undisclosed amount, expanding its North American footprint in the latest of a string of recent acquisitions.
Trading levels surged at the beginning of the COVID-19 and have remained elevated, benefiting exchange operators like Cboe, the third-largest U.S. stock exchange operator by volume.
The NEO deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, pending regulatory approval, will give Cboe a fully registered securities exchange in Canada in addition to the alternative trading system MATCHNow, which it acquired last year, creating operating efficiencies though scale.
Together, the two trading platforms have a share of around 16.5% of the Canadian equities market and will be better placed to compete against Toronto Stock Exchange operator TMX Group. 
""Adding NEO to the Cboe network better enables us to create a first-class equities offering in Canada, bolstering our global markets in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, and bringing us one step closer to our vision of building one of the world's largest global derivatives and equities trading networks,"" said Cboe Chief Executive Officer Ed Tilly.
In the past month, Cboe has said it agreed to acquire cryptocurrency trading platform Eris Digital Holdings (ErisX), a spot and derivatives exchange for digital assets; announced it was a limited partner in the planned acquisition of trading software firm Trading Technologies International; and said it planned to launch a new U.S. Treasuries trading platform. 

NEO also offers listing and market data services, and its sister company, NEO Connect, provides a distribution platform supporting mutual funds, private funds and private corporate bonds. 
Chicago-based Cboe operates trading platforms and products in equities, derivatives and foreign exchange across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.

DUBAI (Reuters) -GE Aviation is ready to look at acquisitions to top up its portfolio with technologies that could help it shape the future of flight, without waiting for a planned break-up of its parent  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co , its top executive said on Monday.
""(If there is) alignment with our strategic goals and assuming that the business case makes sense, we are open to look at opportunities,"" GE Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters.
""I want to be clear that our opportunities to be strategic in the marketplace are effective today,"" he said in an interview at the Dubai Airshow, adding such opportunities ""probably run deeper and wider"" in systems such as electric power systems than in jet engines.
""We do want to grow; the opportunities are there within our ecosystem of aerospace and defense so there will be plenty of opportunities for growth,"" Slattery said.
He stressed the world's largest aero engine maker felt under ""no undue pressure"" to make external investments.
General Electric (GE) last week announced plans to spin off its businesses into three public companies, marking the end of the 129-year-old conglomerate.
The Boston-based company will separate the healthcare company in early 2023. It will combine GE Renewable Energy, GE Power and GE Digital and spin off the business in early 2024.
Following the split, it will become an aviation company, helmed by Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Culp. 
The aviation company will inherit GE's other assets and liabilities, including its runoff insurance business.
Slattery said GE Aviation had not been placed under any restrictions by Culp or the board limiting its ability to look at adjacent technologies ""or other inorganic opportunities"" - as long as they fit the strategy and have a good business case.
""If they do, we are not time-bound in terms of waiting until the spin-offs occur,"" Slattery said.
BROADER APERTURE
""I think it is probably fair to say the opportunities to broaden the aperture ... probably run deeper and wider in our systems business than they would in inorganic (acquisition) opportunities on the commercial or military engine front.""
Analysts say high-tech systems and associated technologies are key to the future of aircraft which will see a more seamless integration between powerplants and airframes than in the past.
GE Aviation's main competitor in engines for in-demand narrowbody commercial jet engines and in military jet engines, Pratt & Whitney, is part of the Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) conglomerate that combines a broad slate of aircraft systems.
In the past three years, Culp has focused on reducing debt by selling assets. 
After a $30 billion deal in March to merge GE's jet-leasing unit with Ireland's AerCap, Culp said GE would look to ""play more offense"" to grow its industrial business.
Since then, the company has pursued ""bolt-on"" acquisitions in the healthcare space. 
GE and French partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) have announced proposals for a new open-fan jet engine that would include some hybrid-electric power, while electrification is seen as one promising path for decarbonisation of smaller aircraft.
Current-generation engines and aircraft systems are already interconnected to a growing extent, generating service revenues.
Systems and other items generated about $4.5 billion in revenue in 2020, accounting for about one-fifth of GE Aviation's revenue. The share went up from 13% in 2019 as revenues from commercial engines and services were depressed by COVID-19.
GE has not described the new structure in detail.
Asked about his role after the planned GE break-up, Irish-born Slattery said GE Aviation would continue to exist as a unit within an aero-focused GE and that he would continue to run it under Culp after joining from Brazil's Embraer last year.

GE would also independently hold equity interests in AerCap and Baker Hughes as well as a number of legacy liabilities that would be managed independently of GE Aviation, he said.
""I am excited about the opportunity to continue to work with Larry in the years ahead and to learn from him and to fly his wing and let him fly my wing,"" Slattery said.

However, we think technological advancements in coffee processing and growing demand for the beverage should benefit prominent coffee stocks Starbucks (SBUX) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP). But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (KDP) are two prominent players in the coffee industry. SBUX in Seattle, Wash., operates a multinational chain of coffeehouses where it retails, roasts, and provides its brand of specialty coffee, bottled coffee drinks, and a line of ice creams. The company also licenses its trademarks through licensed stores and grocery and foodservice accounts. In comparison, KDP in Plano. Tex., manufactures and distributes specialty coffee, brewers, soft drinks, juices, teas, mixers, water, and other beverages to retailers, bottlers and distributors, restaurants, hotel chains, office coffee distributors, and end-use consumers.
With COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in Vietnam and uncommon drought and freezing temperatures in Brazil destroying coffee crops, rising fertilizer costs, and supply chain disruptions worldwide, coffee prices have surged to seven-year highs. While various efforts are being made to address the supply shortages, the introduction of automated brewery software and solutions, new flavors of coffee and its products, and better packaging should enable the companies to overcome input costs and profit from the continued rise in demand. Investor optimism in this space is evident in the iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return ETN’s (JO) 15.1% returns over the past three months, versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 5% gains. The global coffee market is expected to grow at a 2.8% CAGR between 2021- 2025. So, both SBUX and KDP should benefit.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp expects the rollout of three new sport-utility vehicles, starting with the CX-50 next year, will help the Japanese automaker boost U.S. new-vehicle sales by a third by mid-decade, the company's North American chief executive said on Monday.
The company expects U.S. sales to finish this year ""on the order of 330,000,"" up from almost 280,000 last year, when supplies were hurt by the semiconductor shortage, Jeff Guyton said in an interview after Mazda unveiled the mid-sized CX-50. Mazda's U.S. sales through October this year were up 30% to almost 293,000.
With two larger SUVs joining the CX-50 by 2023, Guyton sees sales jumping further.
""We do see a significant increase coming from CX-50, and the CX-70 and CX-90,"" he said. ""Maybe those don't all mature in 2022, but by the middle of the decade, I would hope that we're on par for 450,000 in the U.S.""
Mazda is scheduled to launch the CX-50 in January at the plant it built in Huntsville, Alabama, with  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. Toyota, which has a 5% stake in Mazda, already builds the Corolla Cross crossover vehicle at the $2.3 billion plant, which will have an annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles split evenly between the two automakers.
Guyton said the launch remains on track despite a ""moving feast"" of supply-chain constraints like the chip shortage, higher raw material costs and port congestion.
""I’m not seeing that it's going to affect our launch cadence right now. We don’t see that,"" he said. ""We have a steady build of production starting in January and then through the spring.""

Guyton said the Alabama plant was built to be able to produce electric vehicles in the future, but said no plans beyond a hybrid version of the CX-50 have been announced. 
Mazda has said it plans to launch 13 electrified vehicles by 2025, including five hybrid models, five plug-in hybrids and three pure electric vehicles. Guyton said Mazda had no announcements to make around any battery joint ventures.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended just below the flatline Monday, as investors awaited further catalysts after the broader market snapped its five-week win streak last week amid inflation concerns.
The S&P 500 closed unchanged, at 0.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.04%, or 13 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.04%.
In a sign that investor sentiment remains skittish, utilities and consumer staples - defensive sectors of the market – led gains to the upside.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) was the biggest advancer in consumer staples after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Energy was higher, shrugging off lower oil prices even as the debate intensified as to whether the U.S. will release oil from its strategic petroleum reserves to help curb gas prices.
“Selling pressure is still being generated by the debate about the release of strategic oil reserves in the US,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
 Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) were leading to the upside in energy sector, with the latter boosted by a by a UBS upgrade to buy rating from neutral amid expectations for higher oil prices.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) jumped more than 5% on optimism that the aircraft making could soon resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, following production issues.
Also helping the stock, China is reportedly close to approving Boeing’s changes to its 737 MAX plane.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell more than 1%, dragging consumer discretionary stocks lower after chief executive Elon Musk was involved in a twitter spat with Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders.
In response to Sanders’ tweet that the “extremely wealthy pay their fair share,” Musk said, “Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word.”
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), however, kept losses in check for the sector, rising more than 14% after the Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy and raised its price target to $148 from $96 a share following news that Dollar tree activist investor had taken a more than 5% stake in the retailer.
“We are upgrading DLTR to Buy from Hold as we now see improved risk/reward through potential operational and profitability improvements at Family Dollar given a greater sense of urgency with Mantle Ridge's influence,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note.
The consumer discretionary sector will remain in focus this week as several retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), HD, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are among the notable names set to report quarterly earnings.
Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) slumped more than 20% after the oat milk maker warned that slower production in the U.S., inflationary pressures and fresh pandemic-linked restrictions in Asia would dent full-year revenue.
 WeWork  (NYSE:WE) narrowed its losses in the third quarter of the year even as revenue fell. Its shares gained more than 3%.
In Washington, House Democrats are expected to pass President Joe Biden’s $1.75 trillion social and climate spending package, or Build Back Better Act, later this week."

AmEx, which expects to bring its full workforce back to the office on Jan. 24 next year, does not expect to introduce mandatory COVID-19 testing programs with the vaccination requirement in place.

Unvaccinated U.S. employees and those without any proof of vaccination can ask for a virtual work arrangement, the memo said, if they can effectively work from home. 
The mandate extends to contractors, visitors to any of AmEx's U.S. offices and employees who wish to participate in in-person events of the company.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
No link seen between vaccines and menstrual changes
Many women have reported noticing changes in their menstrual cycle after being vaccinated against COVID-19 but a new study of 1,273 women in the UK found no correlation, according to a report posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266317v1. The women in the study kept careful records of their cycles and their vaccination dates. ""We were unable to detect strong signals to support the idea"" that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to changes in timing or flow of women's periods, said Victoria Male from Imperial College London. It is possible that larger studies, or studies in other countries, might find links, she said. ""It is important to note that most people who report such a change following vaccination find that their period returns to normal the following cycle."" Other studies have found no evidence that the vaccines affect female fertility, Male added.
Safe to get COVID-19 vaccine, flu shot together
It is safe to administer COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines to patients at the same time, and doing so might increase vaccination rates, according to a report published on Thursday in The Lancet https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02329-1/fulltext. Researchers randomly assigned 697 adult volunteers to receive their second dose of either the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or the viral-vector vaccine from AstraZeneca/Oxford, along with one of three influenza vaccines for the 2020-2021 season (FluAd or Flucelvax from Seqirus UK or Flublok from  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY)) or a placebo. Most reactions to the shots were mild or moderate, and antibody responses to the vaccines were not adversely affected by getting two shots at once, the study found. Giving both vaccines at a single appointment ""should reduce the burden on health-care services for vaccine delivery, allowing for timely vaccine administration and protection from COVID-19 and influenza for those in need,"" the research team concluded. 
Lung cancer patients respond well to COVID-19 vaccines

Lung cancer patients may get good protection from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines even while undergoing treatments that suppress the immune system, a small study suggests. From January through July this year, researchers in France administered the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech to 306 lung cancer patients, 70% of whom had recently received immunosuppressive therapies that impair the body's ability to respond to vaccines. Patients with COVID-19 antibodies from a previous infection received only one dose; most patients, however, received both doses, according to a paper released on Monday and scheduled for publication in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology https:// About 10% of the patients failed to develop antibodies in response to the first two doses and received a third dose, which successfully induced antibodies in all but three individuals who also had blood disorders known to impair the effect of the vaccines. The researchers noted that before vaccines, the death rate among lung cancer patients who developed COVID-19 was 30%. In this seven-month study, only eight patients, or 2.6% of the total, developed mild cases of COVID-19. Because the study was small and not randomized, the investigators called for more research to confirm their findings.

466,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 03:23PM ET</span>","Walmart, Home Depot, Retail Sales: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks started the week off on a down note as investors braced for a busy week of major retailer earnings, beginning with Walmart and  Home Depot  on Tuesday.
Retail sales data due out on Tuesday could light a fire under retail stocks as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. Rising inflation expectations pushed up Treasury yields.
Inflation fears are weighing on stocks as the Biden administration pledges to get a handle on rising costs. Gas prices hit a record in California, surging to $4.68 a gallon, but in some areas of the state, gas was selling for over $5 a gallon.
Rising gas prices are happening even though the price of crude has sold off recently, down three consecutive weeks. Some have speculated that President Joe Biden would boost supply -- and thus pressure prices lower -- by releasing some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
This is after the cartel of major oil producing nations decided not to hike production beyond the measured approach it has already agreed to follow, adding output gradually. Rising Covid-19 cases in Europe and the U.S., with some European spots going back to at least partial lockdowns, is raising concern about oil demand. 
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped another 4% as CEO Elon Musk continued to sell shares, something he has to do as he exercises options that were granted as part of his compensation. Tesla fell 15.4% last week after Musk telegraphed his planned sales in a poll on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Walmart earnings
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)is expected to report third-quarter profit per share of $1.40 on revenue of $135.42 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Home Depot earnings
Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is seen clocking third-quarter revenue of $34.83 billion and EPS of $3.41.
3. Retail sales
U.S. retail sales in October are seen rising 1.2% month-on-month, stronger than September’s 0.7% monthly gain. The data come out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said on Monday it will expand free access to the social networking site's data to help software developers create tools and products that could promote safer online conversations or curate content.
The move is part of Twitter's growing effort over the past year to decentralize the company, a vision that aims to give users more control over what content they see in their Twitter feed or have new ways of sharing content on the site, Amir Shevat, Twitter's head of product for the developer platform, said in an interview. 
The effort to increase developer access also comes as Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social media companies are facing global scrutiny over how their algorithms surface certain content and their role in allowing misinformation or hate speech to spread.
Starting on Monday, developers can access data on up to 2 million tweets per month through Twitter's application programming interface (API) at no cost.
The company also changed its API policy to allow for more use cases, including removing restrictions on competing with Twitter, Shevat said.
""I want everyone to be able to define their preferences and have their own curated content that's adjusted to them,"" Shevat said. ""We can only do this if developers are in on it.""

Some examples of apps built with Twitter data include Block Party, which was founded by software engineer Tracy Chou and allows Twitter users to filter out content they do not want to see.
Another app built by software engineer Janique-ka John lets users more easily search for Twitter Spaces, the company's live audio chat feature.

(Reuters) - Investors once believed that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's fortunes rose and fell with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone, which uses a key ""modem"" chip from the San Diego company to connect to mobile data networks.
But as Qualcomm prepares for an investor presentation on Tuesday where it will outline plans to land its chips in everything from virtual reality headsets to self-driving cars to telecommunications gear, analysts said a looming loss of Apple, which is working on its own chips to replace Qualcomm's, might not matter much to Qualcomm's profits.
""Frankly, revenues are getting to the point where the worry over Apple possibly moving away is much smaller,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Ragson wrote in a note.
The change comes from a diversification strategy put in place years ago by Cristiano Amon, who ran the company's chip division before becoming chief executive this year. 
Earlier this month, Qualcomm said it expects adjusted earnings growth of more than 20% for fiscal 2022, where Wall Street had only been expecting growth of 12.5%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company have risen almost 19% since Qualcomm gave its forecast. 
""Anything beyond our contract with (Apple) is an upside to our model,"" Amon said during an earnings call Nov. 3. ""They have a large number of devices. And if there are opportunities, we'll be very happy to engage with them on supply.""
Apple's business likely won't drop off all at once, analysts said. Evercore ISI analyst CJ Muse said ""it’s a matter of when not if,"" Apple leaves. 
But Angelo Zino of CFRA Research said Apple likely will leave in phases, introducing internal chips only for one or two devices initially.

And in the meantime, Qualcomm has gained market share among Android phones because Qualcomm customers are filling the vacuum left from Huawei's exit from the smartphone market. Brands such as China's Honor are turning to the U.S. chip firm for supply.
""Qualcomm’s China handset (revenue) is growing faster than Apple is growing, which is helping to offset any Apple reductions,"" Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An international agreement to reduce coal use dragged miners' shares lower on Monday, but tight supply of the commodity provided a floor for a sector that has chalked up huge gains this year.
U.N. climate talks in Glasgow ended on Saturday with a deal targeting fossil fuel use. Wording was softened to call for a ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" of coal after lobbying from India, among others.
Big miners China Shenhua Energy and Yanzhou Coal (OTC:YZCAY) fell 1% and 2.4% respectively in Hong Kong, where the broader stock market edged up slightly. 
An index of mainland-listed miners fell about 1%. Coal stocks in other regions also came under pressure.
""Climate activists will undoubtedly frame COP26 as failing on coal (and fossil fuels). We look past this frustration (and current energy market conditions) and see ongoing incremental consensus in the need to reduce demand for fossil fuel,"" said Cowen analyst John Miller.
In Indonesia, the world's biggest coal exporter, declines were exacerbated by surging production in China, a top customer. No. 1 miner Bumi Resources fell 5.7%, while Adaro Energy and Indika Energy tumbled 4.5% and 7% respectively. 
Shares in Australia-listed thermal coal miner Whitehaven Coal fell 1.6% and rival New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) about 1% in a slightly firmer broad market. (AX)
Stocks were also hit in the United States. Shares of Peabody Energy Corp were down roughly 8%, Arch Resources Inc slumped 5% and Consol Energy Inc dropped about 3%. Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC) slipped about 3%, while Hallador Energy Co fell 7%.
'CASH GENERATOR'
Metallurgical coal miners  South32  (OTC:SOUHY) and Coronado Global Resources slid some 1.4% and 4% respectively.
The moves extend a recent pullback that has taken the edge off huge year-to-date gains for Whitehaven, South32 and New Hope amid a global energy crunch. They are still each up more than 40%.
""The reality is that coal is going to be used during the next decade or so. It's still going to be a cash generator,"" said Mathan Somasundaram, chief executive of Sydney-based research firm Deep Data Analytics.
China, the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal, churned out its highest tonnage in more than six years last month, official data showed, which helped to knock near-term spot prices on Monday.
The Glasgow deal has elicited promises of future cuts to use, resolved rules for carbon markets and also takes aim at fossil fuel subsidies - all of which could speed up the transition to other energy sources.
Elsewhere in Asia, Seoul-listed mine owners and suppliers KEPCO, LX International and Doosan Heavy traded between a fall of 2.5% and a gain of 0.6% in a broader market that was up 1%.
Thai miner Banpu fell 2.7%. Shares in Coal India slid 4.3%, also weighed down by soft quarterly results. 
Among other mining stocks,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) , the world's third largest exporter of metallurgical coal, fell around 1.4% in London, while Sasol (NYSE:SSL), which operates coal mines in South Africa, gained over 1%. 
George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management in Melbourne, said under-investment in coal projects would probably keep spot prices elevated from a historical perspective but the fuel's likely eventual demise might limit gains for stocks.
""High thermal coal prices... will not necessarily translate into higher share prices to the same degree,"" he said. Oil fell around 1% and gas was firmer. [O/R]

Some investors see uranium filling some of the gap left as energy firms retreat from coal. This has helped uranium futures to soar along with other commodities in recent weeks.
Large miners have rallied, lifting Canada's Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) to a decade high last week and Kazakhstan's Kazatomprom to a record.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday refused to dismiss a federal indictment charging Nikola Corp's billionaire founder Trevor Milton with defrauding investors about the electric- and hydrogen-powered truck maker's technology.
U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos rejected Milton's claim that he should not have been indicted in New York for securities fraud and wire fraud because his alleged lies were in Arizona and Utah, where he lives, and the case belonged there if at all.
The Manhattan-based judge said Milton, 39, could be tried in New York if he traded Nikola stock on the Nasdaq and communicated false statements to that state.
Ramos said other factors also supported keeping the case in New York despite Milton's wish to care at home for his wife, who according to court papers has an autoimmune disorder and other ""severe"" health issues.
Lawyers for Milton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have called the indictment ""legally deficient"" and plan to seek a dismissal on substantive grounds.
Nikola has not been accused of wrongdoing. 
Authorities said Milton used a blitz of social media posts, and TV and podcast interviews to drive up Nikola's stock price over nearly a year.
Prosecutors said he wrongly claimed that Nikola had built an electric- and hydrogen-powered pickup from the ""ground up,"" developed batteries he knew it was buying elsewhere, and was making progress on a truck prototype he knew did not work.
Milton founded Phoenix-based Nikola in 2014 and was chief executive until June 2020, when it went public after merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).
SPACs, a burgeoning market, are investment vehicles that let sponsors take private companies public faster than through initial public offerings, but which critics say are prone to conflicts of interest and shoddy due diligence.
Nikola and other vehicle startups have used SPACs in thehope of commanding high market valuations, like Elon Musk'sTesla Inc.

Prosecutors are also investigating electric truck makerLordstown Motors Corp about its SPAC and statementsabout vehicle pre-orders.
The case is U.S. v Milton, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-cr-00478.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 02:01PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rejects Volkswagen appeals over emissions tampering,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s bid to avoid lawsuits filed by officials in three states seeking damages stemming from the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating scandal.
The justices refused to hear appeals by VW and German auto supplier Robert Bosch LLC of a lower court ruling allowing Florida's Hillsborough County and Utah's Salt Lake County to seek to hold the companies liable under local laws and regulations barring tampering with vehicle emissions controls. The court also rejected VW's appeal of a similar ruling in a case brought by the state of Ohio.
A VW spokesperson noted that the court's decision not to hear the appeals was not a ""determination of the merits"" of the company's legal arguments.
""We are confident in the strength of our factual and legal defenses, including that the software updates reduced emissions, and will contest these claims vigorously as these cases proceed,"" the spokesperson said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) subsidiary Volkswagen Group of America Inc has argued that under the Clean Air Act, the landmark U.S. environmental law, only the federal government can pursue such claims. VW noted that it already has reached a settlement of more than $20 billion with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The lawsuits accused VW of deceiving the EPA - and in doing so also violating the local laws.
""We're pleased the Supreme Court recognized that federal environmental law does not give car manufacturers the right to defraud Ohioans,"" a spokesperson for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said.
A spokesperson for lawyers representing the two counties added that the Supreme Court's action ""reaffirmed that local governments play a critical role in combating air pollution.""
President Joe Biden's administration, asked by the court to weigh in on the dispute, had urged the justices not to hear the matter, saying the Clean Air Act allows for enforcement of state laws.
In one case, Volkswagen was seeking to overturn a 2020 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 9th Circuit decided that the Clean Air Act did not preempt local efforts to impose liability over vehicles that VW had tampered with after they were sold. The 9th Circuit, however, agreed with VW that it could not be held liable under the local anti-tampering laws for actions it took pre-sale.
The 9th Circuit said its decision could lead to ""staggering liability for Volkswagen."" 
Volkswagen was also seeking to overturn a June ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that reached a similar conclusion.
VW has said it could face huge damages in the cases and potentially others.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Fiat Chrysler, part of Stellantis NV, are facing similar claims.
Volkswagen announced in September that it agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle similar claims in New Hampshire and Montana.

In 2015, Volkswagen disclosed that it had used sophisticated software to evade nitrogen oxide emissions requirements in nearly 11 million vehicles worldwide. It also misled the EPA, which had started asking questions in 2014. 
In addition to equipping vehicles with ""defeat devices"" before they were sold, VW also installed software updates after sale, which was the conduct at issue before the Supreme Court. At the time, VW did not reveal the true purpose of the updates, which were aimed at refining the software used to control the emissions.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","Shell ditches the Dutch, seeks move to London in overhaul","By Shadia Nasralla and Sachin Ravikumar
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Monday it would scrap its dual share structure and move its head office to Britain from the Netherlands, pushed away by Dutch taxes and facing climate pressure in court as the energy giant shifts from oil and gas.
The company, which long faced questions from investors about its dual structure and had recently been hit by a Dutch court order over its climate targets, aims to drop ""Royal Dutch"" from its name - part of its identity since 1907 - to become Shell Plc.
The firm has been in a long-running tussle with the Dutch authorities over the country's 15% dividend withholding tax on some of its shares, making them less attractive for international investors. Shell introduced the two-class share structure in 2005 after a previous corporate overhaul.
The new single structure with all shares under British law means none of its shares would be under this tax. It would also allow Shell to strike swifter sale or acquisition deals.
In a further knock to its relations with the Netherlands, the biggest Dutch state pension fund ABP said last month it would drop Shell and all fossil fuels from its portfolio.
The Dutch government said on Monday it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" by Shell's plans to move to London from The Hague.
In a political long-shot, Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Stef Blok contacted the heads of political parties in parliament on Monday to gauge support for scrapping the dividend tax, broadcaster RTL reported.
The government was forced to withdraw the same plan in 2018 following widespread opposition to the move, which was seen by the public as a gift to foreign shareholders.
Shell's decision will, however, be seen as a vote of confidence in London after Britain's exit from the European Union triggered a shift in billions of euros in daily share trading from the UK capital to Amsterdam.
Shell's shares, which will still be traded in Amsterdam and New York under the plan, climbed more than 2% in London on Monday morning after the news.
""The current complex share structure is subject to constraints and may not be sustainable in the long term,"" Shell said, as it announced its plan to change the structure.
The dual structure means Shell now has primary listings in both London and Amsterdam, as well as two overarching legal headquarters despite operating as one economic group.
Such set-ups are expensive and complex, requiring the replication of board-level functions in two jurisdictions as well as being incorporated under two different legal regimes.
The change requires at least 75% of votes by shareholders at a general meeting to be held on Dec. 10, the company said.
""Among other benefits, the proposed changes will increase Shell's ability to buy back shares,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a research note.
Shell has said it would return $7 billion from selling U.S. assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in addition to an ongoing share buyback programme.
'MORE AGILE'
Monday's move follows a major overhaul Shell completed this summer as part of its strategy to shift away from oil and gas to renewables and low-carbon energy. The overhaul included thousands of job cuts around the world.
In May, a Dutch court ordered Shell to deepen its planned greenhouse gas emission cuts in order to align with the Paris climate deal which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Shell has said it would appeal.
""If this decision will enable the company to be more agile in order to execute its transition to net zero, then it should be viewed positively,"" said Adam Matthews, chief responsible investment officer at Church of England Pensions Board, a Shell shareholder.
Matthews, who is leading talks with Shell on behalf of the investor group Climate Action 100+, said it should not remove Shell's responsibility to implement the Dutch court ruling.
Shell said the change would not change the impact of the court decision.
Shell is also battling calls made last month from activist investor Third Point for the firm to be broken up into multiple companies. Shell's top executives hit back, saying the firm's businesses worked better together.
Corporate giants are under growing pressure to simplify their structures with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announcing plans last week to split into separate companies.
Dual listings, which are more expensive to maintain, are also falling out of favour. 

Consumer products giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) abandoned its dual Anglo-Dutch structure last year in favour of a single London-based entity. Miner BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) has also called time on such a structure.
If BHP and Shell complete their shifts to single share structures, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and Investec will be the few remaining dual-listed companies on London's main market.

Ready-to-wear designer for the upscale Italian label since last year, Blazy worked his way up the fashion ranks, gaining experience at labels including Raf Simons, Maison Margiela and Calvin Klein, and was senior designer at Celine in 2014.
""I am confident that Matthieu Blazy’s wealth of experience and broad cultural background will allow him to bring his creative impetus to the task of carrying on the legacy of Bottega Veneta,” said Kering Chief Executive and Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault. 
The departure of Lee, announced last week https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/kering-name-new-designer-bottega-veneta-daniel-lee-departs-2021-11-10, took the industry by surprise.
The 35-year-old Central Saint Martins graduate, who was recruited over three years ago to reignite interest in the brand with younger audiences, is credited with raising its profile and sales growth, drawing up popular accessories including pillowy leather clutch handbags and slip-on heels. 
Kering has a history of recruiting from its own ranks, boosting the popularity of its star Gucci brand by naming a relatively unknown accessories designer, Alessandro Michele, from within that brand as creative director in 2015. 

Along with large French luxury peers, the group has seen a strong sales recovery from the coronavirus crisis this year.
Born in 1984, Blazy graduated from design school La Cambre in Brussels. His first collection will be released in February 2022.

Spain experienced a baby boom during the last two decades of Francisco Franco's dictatorship which ended in 1975, and people born during that era are expected to retire soon, putting state finances under increasing strain.
The scale of the increase, which will affect employees of all ages and income levels, has been a stumbling block in the three-way talks between the government, unions and businesses that have been going on for several weeks.
Earlier on Monday the CEOE and Cepyme business associations, which respectively represent large and small companies, abandoned the negotiating table, arguing the plan placed too much burden on employers and would damage job creation.

In a statement, Rabobank said it had received an instruction from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) on Oct. 12 to remedy deficiencies in its compliance with laws against money laundering. It said it was too early to say whether the procedure would result in a fine.
""These deficiencies mainly concern the execution, recording and outsourcing of client due diligence, transaction monitoring and reporting of unusual transactions,"" Rabobank said in a statement.
The two other large Dutch banks,  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV and ABN Amro, each reached multimillion-euro settlements with public prosecutors over similar compliance failures in the past several years. Both banks were warned by the DNB about their weak enforcement of anti-money-laundering practices ahead of the settlements. 
A spokesperson for the Dutch public prosecutor's office declined comment on whether it is involved in the DNB procedure disclosed on Monday.

""It's up to the authorities,"" the spokesperson said. ""We don't know, we are not aware of (involvement by prosecutors) but we don't know what happens next.""
In September 2018 ING admitted that criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts and agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) to settle the case.

Analysts have said fried chicken sandwich pioneer Popeyes, owned by Restaurant Brands, has been hurt by McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Yum Brands Inc's KFC launching similar items, while Burger King has underperformed in recent months on weak demand for its lower-priced menu items.
U.S. comparable sales at Burger King declined 1.6%, and slipped 4.5% at Popeyes in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Firehouse Subs, in comparison, reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 20% from pre-pandemic levels between January and October, Restaurant Brands said.
U.S.-listed shares of the company, which also owns Tim Hortons, rose marginally after it said the deal would immediately add to its earnings once it closes in the coming months. It also said it will fund the acquisition through cash on hand and debt.
""(We) have kept an eye on it (Firehouse Subs) from a distance over the years,"" Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Officer Jose Cil told Reuters. 
Firehouse Subs' franchisees own and operate 97% of its 1,200 restaurants across 46 U.S. States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Restaurant Brands has about 27,000 stores in over 100 countries.
""There's a tonne of room for growth here in the U.S. and Canada, and all around the world,"" Cil said about Firehouse Subs, which is popular for its ""Hook & Ladder"" sub.

Firehouse Subs' loyalty program has 3.5 million subscribers, and is adding around 50,000 more customers per month, said Restaurant Brands, which earlier this year saw Burger King and Popeyes launch similar programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of U.S. states led by Texas have filed an amended complaint against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google accusing the tech giant of using coercive tactics and breaking antitrust laws in its efforts to boost its already dominant advertising business.
The updated allegations are the latest in an onslaught of regulatory scrutiny of Google over its practices. The tech company faces several lawsuits, including one by the Justice Department for monopolistic practices. 
Earlier this week, Google lost an appeal https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-court-upholds-eu-antitrust-ruling-against-google-2021-11-10 against a $2.8 billion European Union antitrust decision.
The amended U.S. lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York late Friday, accuses Google of using monopolistic and coercive tactics with advertisers in its efforts to dominate and drive out competition in online advertising. 
The lawsuit also highlights Google's use of a secret program dubbed ""Project Bernanke"" in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers' auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company's Google Ads. They otherwise would have likely lost the auctions, the states alleged.
A Google spokesperson said the lawsuit mischaracterizes one of the improvements the firm has made to optimize advertisers' bids.

""Just because (Texas) Attorney General (Ken) Paxton asserts something doesn’t make it true. This lawsuit is riddled with inaccuracies,"" the statement said.
The Texas attorney general's office did not response to requests for comment on the lawsuit.

(Reuters) -Soaring meat prices helped  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) overcome pandemic-related labor shortages at its plants as the top U.S. meat packer reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday and forecast improved revenue in the year ahead.
The Springdale, Arkansas-based company reported a double-digit jump in sales and earnings in the fiscal fourth-quarter ended Oct. 2, including a record quarter in its beef segment despite a 20% surge in cattle prices.
Tyson shares were up around 4% in midmorning trading.
Rising meat prices and improving demand from restaurants have boosted U.S. meat companies including Tyson after the COVID-19 pandemic kept many diners at home last year. Meat packers have also seen record demand for American beef from China and amid diplomatic tensions between Beijing and supplier Australia.
Increased costs for labor, transportation and items such as feed grain and packaging have created headaches, however.
""Inflation has clearly had an impact on the business,"" said CEO Donnie King. ""As rates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions.""
Top aides to U.S. President Joe Biden blamed Tyson and other large meat rivals that control much of the meat processing sector for rising food prices.
Tyson has rejected those assertions and instead blamed the pandemic and the U.S. labor shortage for limiting production. 
The Jimmy Dean sausages maker said it was expecting sales of $49 billion to $51 billion for fiscal 2022, compared with market estimates of $47.99 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Sales rose to $12.81 billion in the fourth quarter from $11.46 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting sales of $12.66 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Net income attributable to Tyson increased to $1.36 billion, or $3.71 per share, from $654 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-off items, Tyson earned $2.30 per share, compared with estimates of $2.03.

Investing.com — Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) shares jumped 6% on Monday after H.C. Wainwright upgraded the stock to buy from neutral. 
Blink traded around $42.60 at midday. 
Analyst Sameer Joshi told investors in a research note that ""several positive developments"" were the reason for the upgrade with a significantly improved economic environment driven by the U.S. infrastructure bill, which includes $7.5 billion of federal spending on the electric vehicle charging network.
Joshi cited the U.S. administration's aim of altering the existing $7,500 from a tax credit to a tax refund and the additional $4,500 benefit for vehicles built in U.S. factories as a reason electric vehicle demand will increase.
H.C. Wainwright currently has a $50 price target on Blink shares.
Elsewhere, Matt Summerville at DA Davidson increased the price target on Blink chares to $35 from $31, maintaining a neutral rating. The analyst said he is optimistic about Blink's utilization of its EV chargers after its third-quarter revenue ""handily"" beat analyst expectations."

The expansion of e-commerce has accelerated since the global pandemic, while upcoming international rules on plane emissions are putting pressure on freight operators to modernise fleets.
""It is very clear that ... e-commerce is a very stabilising factor in the freighter market place and a growing factor,"" said Air Lease Chief Executive John Plueger.
A letter of intent for the freighters signed at the Dubai Airshow on Monday also included more than 100 passenger jets: 25 A220-300s, 55 A321neos, 20 A321XLRs and four wide-body A330neos.
Industry sources said the coveted endorsement from one of the powerhouse lessors that drive the $150 billion jet market may have included sweeteners such as some conversions between models and attractive delivery slots for the in-demand A321XLR.
""We are supremely confident with this order, and that we will have more orders in the future,""  Air Lease Corp  (ALC) Chief Executive John Plueger said.
The order will be finalised in coming months, Airbus said, without giving a value for the deal.

Airbus and ALC also said they would launch a multimillion-dollar ESG (environmental, social and governance) fund initiative that would contribute towards investment into sustainable aviation development projects.
Boeing, which dominates the market for cargo planes, is expected to launch a competing freighter version of its 777X wide-body passenger plane within weeks. It said on Sunday it was in advanced talks with potential customers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts see the S&P 500 moving lower in 2022, with equity markets more volatile as earnings growth slows, bond yields climb and companies try to manage supply chain disruptions and higher input costs. 
In a note on Sunday, the firm said it was underweight the benchmark S&P index due to slower earnings per share growth and higher starting valuations versus its global peers, and its base-case target of 4,400 implied downside potential of 5%. 
On an earnings per share (EPS) view, Morgan Stanley sees the best growth next year in Europe and Japan, while the firm is neutral on emerging markets. 
While the firm still expects solid EPS growth next year, ""uncertainty around that expectation goes up materially given cost pressures, supply issues, along with tax and policy uncertainty that is unique to the U.S.,"" the analysts wrote in the note. With the rest of the world having lagged the U.S. recovery, the firm sees more ""catch up"" potential elsewhere and less earnings volatility over the next 12 months. 

While Morgan Stanley does expect earnings for the S&P 500 overall to be solid, chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson expects ""significant"" earnings dispersion at the stock level, making the year more about stocks than sectors or styles. 
Still, even with the expectation that sectors and styles will be more volatile, the firm is overweight healthcare, real estate and financials. Consumer discretionary, more specifically stocks that are good-oriented, are an underweight, as is tech hardware.

Hence, we think cannabis stocks Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), Endo International (ENDP), and HEXO (NASDAQ:HEXO), which each gained more than 9% in price last week, could be worth adding to one’s watchlist. Let’s discuss.Increasing demand for therapeutic cannabis from an aging population and changes in consumer preferences toward innovative recreational cannabis products have been driving the cannabis industry’s growth. The legal cannabis market is expected to reach $34.91 billion by 2025, registering a 21.39% CAGR.
Cannabis stocks bounced back last week on hopes sprung by a reported Republican-led legalization effort. A report by Marijuana Moment stated that cannabis would be treated similar to alcohol, and raw cannabis would be considered as an agricultural commodity regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Both U.S. and Canadian cannabis stocks have skyrocketed on legalization hopes. Indeed, investors’ interest in the cannabis industry is evidenced by the AdvisorShares Trust - AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF’s (YOLO) 17.5% returns over the past year.
Cannabis stocks  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL), Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB), Endo International plc (ENDP), and HEXO Corp. (HEXO) spiked more than 9% in price last week. So, we think these stocks could be good additions to one’s watchlist.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday approved Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's agreement to acknowledge liability for compensatory damages in lawsuits filed by families of the 157 people killed in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash.
As a result of the agreement filed last week between Boeing and the families, lawyers for the victims will not seek punitive damages and Boeing will not challenge the lawsuits being filed in Illinois.
Boeing said last week it was ""committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss.""
Lawyers for the victims noted in a statement last week that Boeing admitted under the agreement ""that the 737 MAX had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else"" for the crash.
All further planned depositions with former and senior Boeing executives were canceled as a condition of the settlement.
Boeing's best-selling plane was grounded for 20 months after 346 people died in two 737 MAX crashes - in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019. The plane was returned to service after Boeing made significant software and training improvements.

The crashes already have cost Boeing some $20 billion. In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018.
Under the deal with Boeing, the victims' families also agreed to dismiss claims against Rosemount Aerospace, a company that made sensors for the 737 MAX, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), the parent of Rosemount and a key supplier for the MAX.

MILAN (Reuters) - Staff at Monte dei Paschi di Siena branches across northern Italy had circled Oct. 27 on their calendars as the day their professional lives would take a turn for the better. 
Years of feeling they were held back by the Tuscan lender's huge pile of bad loans and poorer performing southern branches were on the cusp of being behind them, with UniCredit set to take on the bank's choicer assets. 
    ""We couldn't wait to join UniCredit and be rewarded properly when we hit sales targets,"" said one senior MPS branch employee in Tuscany, where it controls 18% of the market.
But on Oct. 23 news broke that the deal was off , with the Treasury and UniCredit unable to agree terms. 
The breakdown led to celebrations in the frescoed rooms of MPS' Sienese headquarters, whose staff UniCredit had little use for, but it has cast a pall over the stronger branches and at the Treasury in Rome, as it tries to find a plan B.
After rescuing MPS in 2017, the Treasury had been working over the past four years to cut its 64% stake, a move decreed by European Union authorities to avoid contravening state aid regulations.
Rome is now preparing to negotiate a years-long extension of the December 2021 deadline to reprivatise the bank.
Officials in Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government have not appeared too dismayed by the failure of the talks, arguing the demands of UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel - including that the deal boost UniCredit's earnings per share by 10% - were ""unacceptable"". 
They are now confident their collapse will persuade the EU to grant Italy more time to strike a deal without a tight deadline weakening its bargaining power. 
IMPROVED PROSPECTS
""The new deadline will give Italy time to strengthen the bank and get to a point where its improved prospects, and a healthy economy, will allow it to complete a transaction,"" Treasury Undersecretary Federico Freni told Reuters.
The EU has said discussions were ongoing.
To avoid falling foul of EU state aid rules, Italy must also convince private investors to put more money into the lender.
Fixing MPS, which emerged as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in a July sector check-up, would have allowed Italy to conclude a 250 billion euro ($286 billion) clean-up of its banking sector it began six years ago, a huge badge of honour for the Draghi government. 
The Treasury plans to rid MPS of unprofitable operations, bad debt and legacy legal problems, and find what one source says is at least 3.5 billion euros in fresh capital.
But the tie-up with UniCredit was the best argument Rome had to lure investors on board for a capital hike. By paying for the acquisition in shares, UniCredit would have turned investors in MPS into its own shareholders.
""The Treasury looks set to try once more to turn MPS around,"" former European Central Bank Supervisory Board Member Ignazio Angeloni said.
""But I'm not positive they'll manage to complete, over a shorter period of time, the restructuring they haven't been able to pull through in four years.""
MPS CEO Guido Bastianini last week called for speedy action, saying the bank's turnaround couldn't progress without more cash.
The lender is looking to lift early staff exits to up to 4,000 from 2,600 at present as it revises a multi-year business plan to prove to EU authorities it can stand alone.
With expenditures - especially staff costs - currently eating up 70% of its income, MPS is far from the 50.6% EU-set target. The Treasury is negotiating a less stringent cost-to-income goal that would anyway mark an improvement versus the current plan's 60% projection, two people close to the matter said.
INSURANCE PARTNER
Bankers warn MPS will struggle to tap markets again, after raising 25 billion euros over the past 13 years - 25 times its current market value.
The best chance is to rope in investors that have an interest in keeping MPS alive, like its insurance partner AXA, another two people familiar with the matter said.
The French insurer relies on a joint venture with MPS to distribute its products in Italy, which accounts for 4.6% of revenues. MPS' placement fees for wealth management products soared 38% annually in the first nine months.
A revision of the terms of the partnership, renewed in 2017 for 10 years, could be part of discussions with AXA, one of the people said. Both AXA, which holds 0.1% of the bank, and MPS declined to comment.
Inside MPS' branches, people are resigned to a long wait.

""Orcel's demands were starting to get on our nerves ... but now we risk being stuck in limbo for two years,"" the MPS employee said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - 7-Eleven, the convenience chain known for Slurpees and Big Gulp beverages, has been sued by a U.S. consumer who claims its private-label Wasabi Delight Flavored Snack Mix contains no wasabi.
The lawsuit, filed on Sunday night in Manhattan federal court by Oscar Ithier, joins hundreds of proposed $5 million-or-larger class actions accusing food companies of overcharging consumers through false and misleading packaging.
Ithier said the label for 7-Eleven's snack mix is deceptive because neither the wasabi powder in the ""crunchy wasabi peanuts"" nor the artificial wasabi flavor in the ""wasabi green peas"" on the ingredients list contains wasabi.
The West Harrison, New York resident also said real wasabi, a greenish Japanese condiment that is similar to horseradish and has antioxidant properties, tastes ""bright and pungent"" with a fast-fading heat, while ""fake"" wasabi burns hotter and longer.
""Defendant gained an advantage against other companies, and against consumers seeking to purchase a product that contained some wasabi,"" the complaint said.
7-Eleven did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. The chain has more than 77,000 stores worldwide, including nearly 16,000 in North America. Its parent is Seven & I Holdings Co.
The lawsuit seeks damages for snack mix purchasers in New York and eight other U.S. states, who typically paid $2.59 or more for a 4.5-ounce (128-gram) bag, whose packaging includes a pair of chopsticks holding a wasabi pea.

Ithier is represented by Spencer Sheehan, a Great Neck, New York, lawyer known for filing dozens of lawsuits claiming that ""vanilla"" products contain little or no vanilla bean.
More recently, he has filed lawsuits alleging that Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co's Strawberry Pop-Tarts contain too few strawberries.

""The enemy is carbon, not internal combustion engines. We shouldn't just focus on one technology but make use of the technologies we already possess,"" Toyoda said at the track. ""Carbon neutrality is not about one having a single choice, but about keeping options open.""
Toyota's latest push into hydrogen tech comes as the world's biggest carmaker joins the rush to win a share of the growing market for battery electric vehicles (BEV) as the world tightens emission regulations to meet carbon-cutting pledges.
Although still only a small portion of vehicles on the road, global electric car registrations in 2020 grew 41% even as the overall car market contracted by almost a sixth, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
By 2025, Toyota plans to have 15 EV models available and is investing $13.5 billion over a decade to expand battery production.
NOT ONLY ELECTRIC
At the gathering in Glasgow, six major carmakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Sweden's Volvo and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz signed a declaration to phase out fossil-fuel cars by 2040. 
Toyota declined https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/toyota-says-large-parts-world-not-ready-zero-emission-cars-2021-11-11 to join that group, arguing that much of the world is not ready for a shift to EVs. Another notable absence was Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
""We don't want to be seen as an EV maker, but as a carbon-neutral company,"" Toyota Vice Chairman Shigeru Hayakawa told Reuters in an interview.
Hayakawa likened the technological choice facing the auto industry to the late 19th century contest that pitted direct current electricity transmission against alternating current. The stakes are high.
""If the adoption of carbon-free fuels happens quickly, that could bring the first battery EV boom to an end,"" said Takeshi Miyao, an analyst at auto industry research company Carnorama.
In Japan, where mass layoffs are politically difficult, hydrogen's allure is that it would cause less disruption than a full switch to EVs. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association estimates the automotive industry employs 5.5 million people.
Although Toyota https://www.reuters.com/article/toyota-hydrogen-idCNL4N2S404A and other car makers are putting resources into building hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV), none have shown the appetite Toyota has for hydrogen engine technology. 
CHALLENGING TECHNOLOGY
One problem is that the engine is not completely carbon-free and cannot therefore be classed as zero-emission. 
Although the byproduct of hydrogen and oxygen combustion is water, a small amount of engine metal burns as well, resulting in about 2% of the emissions of a gasoline engine. The exhaust also contains traces of nitrogen oxide. 
There is a carbon cost to building electric car batteries, but EVs do not pollute when operated. 
Hydrogen cars also need bulky pressurized tanks for their fuel. Much of the rear seat and trunk in Toyota's hydrogen car was taken up by fuel tanks that blocked the rear window.
Safety concerns meant Toyota engineers had to refuel the vehicle far from the pits where other teams worked on their cars.
Such concerns have also slowed the construction of hydrogen fuelling stations in Japan, despite Japanese government backing for the fuel, which it sees as a key component in the country's future carbon-neutral energy mix.
At the end of August, there were 154 hydrogen stations in Japan - six short of what the government wanted by the end of March. 
""Hydrogen has long been known as a potential low-carbon transport fuel, but establishing it in the transport fuel mix has been difficult,"" the IEA said in a progress report https://www.iea.org/reports/hydrogen this month. 
Even with adequate fuel infrastructure, Toyota still must build a vehicle that can compete in price, range and operating cost with conventional gasoline cars and EVs.

In Okayama, Toyoda declined to say when Toyota might launch a commercial hydrogen-engine car. 
""It's good to have a lot of choices. If everything becomes EVs then much of that industry is in China,"" said Eiji Terasaki (57), who had travelled to the Okayama circuit from neighbouring Kagawa prefecture to watch the races.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volvo Cars is considering building a third plant in Europe in order to boost its production capacity beyond 1.2 million vehicles per year, a company spokesperson said on Sunday.
German autos publication Automobilwoche reported earlier on Sunday that the company was planning on building another European plant by the middle of the decade to meet its production target of 1.2 million vehicles a year, quoting Volvo Cars CFO Bjorn Annwall.
A company spokesperson said by email to Reuters that the company was already able to produce 1.2 million vehicles annually at its six existing factories and wanted to increase its capacity beyond this amount, but no plans had been finalised as of yet.
""What we can say at this stage is that no decision has been made. However, Volvo Cars has grown rapidly over the past decade and aim to continue to grow at a similar pace going forward,"" the spokesperson said to Reuters.

The Gothenburg-based company, which became Sweden's second largest listing yet after its IPO in late October with a valuation of $18 billion, currently produces around 800,000 cars a year at its two factories - one in Sweden and the other in Belgium.
""We need both our plants in Europe... but we need more. That's why we want to build a third plant,"" Annwall said to Automobilwoche. Where that plant will be located is not yet clear, he said.

And because banks typically fare well in inflationary conditions, we think it could be wise now to add quality banking stocks  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) to one’s portfolio. Read on.The major stock market indices retreated last week as consumer price data showed higher-than-expected inflation. The Consumer Price Index rose 6.2% in October from a year earlier, its biggest jump in more than 30 years. Inflation has been climbing due to rising demand fueled by liquidity, an economic recovery-induced buying spree, and supply-side constraints.
Strong inflationary trends typically mean the value of bonds and cash struggle to keep pace with the rising inflation. According to personal finance expert Suze Orman, “Only stocks have a track record of earning more than inflation.” Banks, especially, tend to benefit when the Fed tightens its monetary policy because of their asset-sensitive nature. When interest rates rise, bank assets like bonds and loans tend to climb higher than their liabilities, such as various deposits. And investors’ interest in the banking stocks is evident in the First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF’s (FTXO) 3.2% gains over the past month.
So, to contribute to making one’s portfolio inflation-proof, we think it could be wise to scoop up quality banking stocks Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), and KeyCorp (KEY). They are expected to gain significantly with the Fed tightening its monetary policy.

Investing.com — Oatly Group's (NASDAQ:OTLY) stock price fell 18% Monday after the company reported its third-quarter earnings, missing revenue consensus and reporting supply chain disruptions.
The vegan, plant-based milk company announced a loss per share of 7 cents on revenue of $171.06 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a per-share loss of 9 cents on revenue of $185.89 million.
Looking ahead, for the full year, the company expects revenue to exceed $635 million, below the $694.1 million consensus. 
Meanwhile, Oatly also told investors that it is investigating a quality issue identified at one of its production facilities that will seemingly result in the destruction of inventory and lost sales in the EMEA region. 
It has also felt the effects of Covid-19 in the region, explaining:
""In EMEA, we are starting to build supply to meet consumer demand, but the pace at which we expected to increase revenue in new and existing retailers and to open new markets is slower than we anticipated as we navigate a dynamic COVID operating environment,"" stated Oatly.

Audi told Reuters it was ""looking at various cooperation ideas"" but did not confirm whether it was discussing a possible sale with McLaren. 
The statements followed a report from autos publication Autocar earlier on Monday that an acquisition agreement had been reached between Audi and McLaren. 
""McLaren Group is aware of a news media report stating it has been sold to Audi. This is wholly inaccurate and McLaren is seeking to have the story removed,"" a company spokesperson said, without responding directly to whether discussions were ongoing with Audi. 
""McLaren's technology strategy has always involved ongoing discussions and collaboration with relevant partners and suppliers, including other carmakers, however, there has been no change in the ownership structure of the McLaren Group,"" they said. 
Acquiring the carmaker would put a second supercar in Audi's books alongside Lamborghini, which it has owned since 1998.
German publication Automobilwoche reported on Sunday that Audi was particularly interested in the Formula 1 division. 
Like other carmakers, McLaren is battling with the challenge of electrifying its fleet without compromising on performance.
Its executive director for purchasing told Reuters in February the company was looking to generate revenue by selling some of its new technology to other automakers, including a new in-house produced carbon chassis to reduce the vehicle's weight. 
Still, a deal with Audi would give it a more comfortable financial backing to ease the transition to electric vehicles, which competitors like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) unit Bentley or  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd's Jaguar Land Rover can rely on. 
The carmaker, set up in 2010 and 42% owned by Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat, partially recovered from a pandemic-driven slump in revenue in the first half of 2021, but still suffered an operating loss of 12.4 million pounds ($16.65 million).

Bloomberg quoted senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing Ihssane Mounir as saying that the company is nearing restarting deliveries of the 787.

The guidance published Monday by the Department of Financial Services directs insurers based in the state to account for their exposure to rising sea levels and climbing global temperatures. That includes disclosing climate risk and incorporating the dangers posed by climate change into risk-management frameworks.
“Climate change is an urgent issue that poses wide-ranging and material risks to the financial system,” DFS Acting Superintendent Adrienne Harris said Monday in a statement. “Insurers, which are uniquely impacted as climate change affects both sides of their balance sheets, also play a critical role in managing climate risks.”
The guidelines build on proposals outlined in March, adjusted through feedback from groups including insurers and climate experts. They arrive as regulators across the globe implement or consider implementing measures that would help to quantify how exposed financial institutions are to climate change.
In June, the Bank of England introduced a stress test of the country’s biggest lenders and insurers to judge how resilient they are to climate change. While officials at the U.S. central bank have resisted the idea of integrating climate-related tests in their annual stress tests of the largest banks, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said he sees “climate scenario analysis” as an area of emerging study.
Among New York-based underwriters are MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET)., the largest U.S. life insurer, and American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)., one of the nation’s largest providers of property and casualty coverage.
In a statement announcing the guidance, the DFS identified itself as the first U.S. regulator to “issue a holistic set of expectations on managing the financial risks from climate change.” The move carries particular weight because the agency oversees major Wall Street firms and other significant financial institutions.
The guidance represents the agency’s latest action on climate change. Earlier this month, the DFS announced it had formed a climate division.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s decision to move its corporate headquarters and tax base to London may win over shareholders but it has struck a blow to Dutch prestige.
As the energy giant crosses the North Sea, it will shed ""Royal Dutch"" from its name, ending a link to the monarchy in the Netherlands that began when the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was formed in 1890.
Even after a tie-up with Britain's Shell Transport and Trading Company in 1907, while the rest of the world knew the merged firm as ""Shell"", most Dutch still referred to it as ""Koninklijke Olie"" or ""Royal Oil"".
Its formal name will now become Shell Plc - if changes to the dual share structure and other plans are approved.
The Dutch government said it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" by the decision, as the country counts the cost of losing another Anglo-Dutch multinational to London after a similar move by consumer giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) last year.
Britain, which has watched billions of euros in share trading move to Amsterdam since its departure from the European Union, called Shell's move a ""vote of confidence"".
Frank van der Vorm of Royal Branding, a company which advises organisations in the Netherlands on how to obtain the ""Royal"" title, put a brave face on Shell's move.
""Their reputation had already come under pressure due to the global focus on fossil fuels,"" he said. ""It's losing its shine.""
Only 150 companies out of 600,000 in the Netherlands had been awarded the ""Royal"" title, he said, which was viewed as sign of longevity and pre-eminence in their field of business. ""It will mainly be a loss for Shell itself,"" he said.
Others were less sanguine. 
""With a Shell departure, the Dutch business climate is worsening,"" the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO) said, calling the departure of Shell an ""enormous bloodletting"" for the Netherlands.
Its decision to move its tax residence out of the Netherlands may have only a modest direct impact on state revenues - Shell said it paid $212 million to the Dutch authorities in 2020 compared to its global corporation tax bill of $3.4 billion.
Shell also sought to soften the blow on Monday, saying only a handful of management posts would move to London.
But it may raise other concerns about business in the Netherlands. Both Shell and Unilever had lobbied the Dutch government to scrap a dividend tax that Britain does not impose.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who began his career at Unilever, tried unsuccessfully to have the tax scrapped. He had warned that multinationals could leave as a result.
Shell had also come under pressure in the Netherlands from climate activists. It is appealing a Dutch court decision in May ordering it to move more quickly to reduce carbon emissions.

(Reuters) -The world's richest man suddenly has more cash than most people can spend in their lifetime. What will he do with it?
Elon Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $270 billion, had traditionally kept his wealth https://www.reuters.com/article/us-billionaires-coronavirus/bezos-musk-among-billionaires-gaining-net-worth-in-pandemic-report-idUSKCN2252JP tied up in his stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the electric car maker founded in 2003. He borrowed against his stock when he needed more cash and sold stock mostly to cover tax obligations.
That was until last week, when his trust sold $5.8 billion worth of Tesla stock in the open market after Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users voted for him to sell 10% of his shares in an online poll https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-asks-followers-twitter-whether-he-should-sell-10-his-tesla-stock-2021-11-06 he created. He sold an additional $1.1 billion worth of Tesla stock to pay taxes associated with the exercising of stock options. 
More stock sales are expected given that he has sold only about 3% of his Tesla shares thus far. He has not disclosed what he will do with the proceeds, yet the cash haul has already created a buzz among major charities which are always vying for wealthy donors.
""His opportunity to have great impact is to donate very significant sums of money to leading organizations that are dealing with the most pressing problems with global poverty and access to healthcare,"" Melissa Berman, CEO of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises on charitable giving, said in an interview. 
Musk did not respond to requests for comment on his plans.
Musk's public philanthropy gestures have so far trailed other billionaires. Musk and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos have donated less than 1% of their net worth, whereas Warren Buffett and George Soros had given away more than 20% of their net worth as of early September, according to Forbes. 
It is possible, however, that many of Musk's charitable donations have not been made public. 
Musk signed the Giving Pledge in 2012, a commitment by some billionaires to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy in their lifetime or upon their death. In 2001, he set up the Musk Foundation, offering grants for the ""development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity"" among other causes, according to its website. 
Musk's foundation has over $200 million in assets, which ""isn't that big"" compared with his fortune, said Brad Smith, the president of Candid, a nonprofit information service that provides information on other nonprofits and foundations.
Earlier this year, Musk and his foundation offered a top prize of $50 million to the inventor who can come up with a technology to help remove carbon from the atmosphere. The prize has yet to be won.
Musk has also flirted with more ambitious philanthropy goals. He tweeted last month that ""if (the United Nations World Food Programme) can describe ... exactly how $6 billion will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.""
Musk was responding to a plea for a donation from David Beasley, the World Food Programme's executive director. Beasley tweeted he was willing to meet Musk to provide more details, and it is not clear if the two explored the idea further.
Beasley and the World Food Programme did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk has shown in previous tweets that he is thinking about ways to have a big philanthropic impact. In January, he asked Twitter users about ""ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems.)""
TAX INCENTIVES
There are also tax benefits associated with charitable giving. Under the U.S. tax code, most donations can be deducted from one's taxable income. 
""Almost any billionaire that you can think of donates money and minimizes tax bills,"" said Ray Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School where she is director of the Forum on Philanthropy and the Public Good.
Besides donating cash, there would be an additional tax benefit for Musk gifting Tesla stock. This is because shares that are donated to charity are not subject to capital gains tax, as they would be if they were sold.
""It's like a double bonus of donating. He is in a position where there's a substantial incentive to donate,"" said Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at the Ohio State University. 
Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk, who is also a Tesla board member, deployed that tactic as recently as last week. He gifted 25,000 Tesla shares worth $31 million to an unidentified charity.

With Tesla's shares hovering near record highs, Musk could take advantage of their current valuation by donating more of them, said Bob Lord, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies who studies tax policy.
""If you're going to donate stock, when do you want to donate it? When it is at its peak,"" Lord said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, after falling last week for the first time in six weeks.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points, or 0.4%, at 36,230 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
However, pockets of weakness persisted, notably in long-duration growth stocks which were the beneficiaries of much new age hype during the first year of the pandemic. Faux milk company Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) followed where faux burger company Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) had gone the week before, plummeting 20% after posting disappointing earnings and saying it may have to destroy some inventory due to quality issues. 
Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) stock also fell 12% after the data analytics and cybersecurity company said its CEO Doug Merritt will step down after six years on the job. Its quarterly numbers, which were also released on Monday, were largely in line with expectations, although the company warned that it still expects to have a negative operating margin of around 14% this year. 
Splunk stock is now down by over one-third from its peak earlier this year, while Oatly and Beyond Meat have fallen by two-thirds from their respective all-time highs. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 3.3%, dipping below $1,000 and testing a three-week low after news that CEO Elon Musk continued selling stock on Friday to help pay a tax bill that is due because he exercised options previously granted as compensation. Musk continued to frame his actions as a response to the Democratic Party's infrastructure and Build Back Better bills, which need big new sources of revenue to fund them. However, the tax liability is due under tax laws inherited from the last Congress. Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for his role in shorting subprime credit in the 2008 crisis, retorted via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that Musk ""just wants to sell Tesla.""
Elsewhere,  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) stock rose 1.0% after reporting earnings that showed that the country's biggest meat producer is successfully getting customers to pay for the higher input costs it is experiencing, notably for labor.  Food price inflation in the U.S. ran at 5.3% on the year through October, but last week's inflation data showed that prices for items such as steak were up nearly 25% on a year, while pork prices were up 14%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock also gained, rising 3.6% to a three-month high after orders for freight aircraft announced at the Dubai Air Show, while Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock surged 14% to a new all-time high after a Wall Street Journal report saying that activist investor Mantle Ridge had accumulated a stake of over 5% in the company with a view to pressing for changes to its board and strategy."

While its high short interest indicates that the stock is a good short squeeze candidate, the company’s bleak financials could limit its upside. So, the question is, is the stock worth betting on now? Read on.Teledentistry company SmileDirectClub, Inc. (SDC) designs and manufactures dental equipment in the United States. The oral care company’s stock has a very high short interest—appproximately 32.8% of its total floating shares have been sold short. However, SDC’s stock price has declined 64.7% year-to-date and 30.4% over the past month. Furthermore, the meme stock candidate is currently trading 73.8% below its 52-week high of $16.08, indicating short-term bearishness.
SDC’s disappointing third-quarter results as surging COVID-19 cases led most people to postpone elective healthcare services, including teeth alignment, have rattled investors.
In addition, the Nashville-based teledentistry company lowered its fourth-quarter guidance because it expects the macroeconomic headwinds to persist. This could further reinforce negative sentiment in the stock.

So, can the stock rally amid stiff competition? Read on.Palo Alto, Calif.-based mobile application technology company AppLovin Corporation (APP) had a disappointing stock market debut on April 15, 2021 and its shares closed down 18.5% on the day. However, the stock has gained 28.9% in price over the past month and 97.3% over the past three months to close Friday’s trading session at $112.36.

However, the Schall Law Firm had announced in April 2021 that it is investigating APP on potential securities laws violations. Furthermore, the company faces intense competition from other players, such as Unity Software Inc. (U) and Playtika Holding Corp. (PLTK). So, the stock’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is a well-known name in the crypto industry with a significant market share, and it has gained significantly over the past few months. However, last week COIN reported a nearly 30% fall in third-quarter trading volumes on a sequential basis. So, with that, is the stock still worth buying? Keep reading to find out. Coinbase Global , Inc. (COIN), in San Francisco, is the most prominent digital asset exchange in the United States. It primarily provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. Over the past month, the stock has gained 37.6% in price to close yesterday’s trading session at $342.98. COIN shares are trading well above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $290.89 and $257.92, respectively.
Shares of COIN retreated initially after the company reported lower-than-expected revenue growth amid the volatility in the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens last week. However, the stock rebounded soon thereafter. “The sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, and it’s playing out in the fourth quarter—when fireworks usually happen,” said Natalia Radyushkin, the chief financial officer of crypto platform Unbanked.com.
COIN’s trading volume slumped nearly 30% sequentially to $327 billion in the third quarter, from $462 billion in the prior quarter. And analysts expect the stock to witness volatility in the coming weeks. On the other hand, given the growing popularity of crypto trading worldwide, and with businesses investing significantly into growing their crypto infrastructure, COIN’s long-term prospects look promising.

Adjusted EBITDA loss was $356 million for the third quarter, $93 million less than the prior quarter’s loss, as the company signed up more clients. The reopening of the economy. and the spread of vaccination among the workforce, led to higher business activity. Revenue rose 11% to $661 million.
WeWork's consolidated gross desk sales were 155,000, including renewals, and equating to 9.3 million square feet. New desk sales totaled 84,000 in the same period. In October, preliminary gross desk sales of 45,000 equated to 2.7 million square feet, and preliminary new desk sales were 25,000.

Sales volumes of beef, pork and chicken each dropped sharply during Tyson’s fiscal fourth quarter, with the decline partially tied to one fewer week in the quarter compared to 2020. Demand remained strong even as higher costs including labor and freight raised meat prices.
Meat producers including Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson have struggled to find enough workers to staff facilities. Labor shortages mean consumers are expected to continue paying elevated prices. The results follow record earnings reported last week by rival  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY).

534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 08:21AM ET</span>",Spain's BBVA raises bet on Turkey with $2.6 billion offer for Garanti,"By Jesús Aguado and Karin Strohecker
MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) offered on Monday to buy the rest of Garanti for up to 2.25 billion euros ($2.6 billion), taking advantage of a slide in the lira and raising fears in Turkey that foreigners might snap up assets at bargain prices.
The cash offer to buy out the remaining 50.15% stake in Garanti for 12.20 Turkish lira ($1.22) per share represented a premium of 15% over Friday's market price.
The proposal means BBVA could potentially buy 51% of Garanti for less than half the 7 billion euros it spent buying up the 49.85% stake it currently holds.
BBVA, like rival Santander (MC:SAN), is struggling to earn money from more mature markets in Europe and has been expanding in emerging markets, where it sees greater growth opportunities.
Other major foreign banks have by contrast been pulling back from Turkey. Last week UniCredit sold its remaining stake in Yapi Kredi to Kok Holding for 300 million euros.
JP Morgan said in note to clients it expected some share price weakness on the ""back of the economic and political risks associated with a larger stake in Garanti.""
But the U.S. broker said increasing the stake in Garanti was more accretive in terms of earnings per share than doing a share buyback for 1.4 billion euros, which it said was equivalent in terms of capital impact.
Shares in BBVA fell 3.9%, while shares in Garanti rose around 10% on the news.
BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres tried to dismiss some market concerns, saying on Monday that the lira depreciation and a potential further economic deterioration was ""already priced in because the returns are so positive"".
BBVA is taking advantage of policy missteps in Turkey, where the central bank has slashed interest rates by 300 basis points since September despite inflation rising to nearly 20% and is expected to cut again this week.
Turkey's lira has weakened sharply in recent months and hit a record low of 10.05 to the dollar.
BBVA has been hedging on the foreign exchange markets to protect its earnings and capital from headwinds in Turkey and bank executives said on Monday it would continue to do so.
ASSETS IN TURKEY AT LOW PRICES
Torres said the deal's entry price in euros was ""very attractive"", and in lira for the minority shareholders.
Some economists in Turkey expressed concern that recently depreciated assets in the country could now be snapped up at very cheap prices by foreign companies.
""We say that exports are going cheap, tourism is going cheap, housing is going cheap by giving citizenship to foreigners,"" Mustafa Sonmez, a Turkish economist and columnist, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""Now, more companies will go to the vultures, with the bank's share at 10 Turkish Lira, getting cheaper in dollars. Garanti is an example of this. It's called total impoverishment (of the country).""
BBVA needs approval from Turkey's Capital Markets Board and the BDDK bank watchdog, government regulators that could technically block the offer.
To cope with the pandemic and ultra-low interest rates, BBVA last year sold its U.S. business, generating more than 8 billion euros to focus on cost cutting in Spain and strengthening shareholder returns.
The Spanish lender's board also recently agreed to buy back 10% of its capital for up to 3.5 billion euros, leaving it with a proforma capital ratio as of September of 13.18, and with an excess capital of around 3.6 billion euros afterwards.
BBVA is expected to give more details regarding additional capital deployments at an investor day later this week.
In the event that not all Garanti shareholders accept the offer though BBVA exceeds a 50% stake, BBVA could increase its holding without launching a takeover bid.
BBVA estimated a maximum negative impact of approximately 46 basis points in the core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio, and around 13.7% accretion to its 2022 earnings per share and an about 2.3% accretion to its tangible book value per share, assuming all Garanti shareholders accept the offer, BBVA said.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) advised BBVA on the deal, which would help the Spanish lender generate up to 25% of its earnings from Turkey from 14% at present. 

The transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2022.

Investing.com – Crowdstrike stock (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 3.3% in Monday’s premarket trading as Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock at 'underweight' on valuation grounds.
The bank cited competitive pressure and pricing challenges.
Analyst Hamza Fodderwala has put a target of $247 on the stock, around 13% below its Friday close of $284.30.
The Cloud-based AI-driven company rode the pandemic-fueled demand for cybersecurity solutions to rise to a leadership position. According to checks by the analyst, CrowdStrike is now increasingly challenged by more competitive next-gen alternatives that are narrowing the functionality gap and offering price points generally 15%-20%+ cheaper.
Fodderwala believes the competitive dynamic makes sustaining the pace of share gains notched up by the company more difficult and drive uncertainty on the pace of topline deceleration through 2022. The stock has more than doubled in the last year and now trades at over 50 times what it has generated in revenue in the last four quarters.

Shares of CoreSite rose 2.1% to $170.25 in premarket trading.
The Denver-based company has more than 24 operating data center facilities in North America, leasing out space to companies that outsource some of their computing power. It started as a company of private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc and became publicly listed a decade ago.

543,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 07:08AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Up 100 Pts; Musk Sales Drag Tesla Further Down,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after the first losing week in six, ahead of the release of the latest U.S. retail sales figures along with earnings from major retailers.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 35 points, or 0.2%.
The three major indices snapped a five-week winning streak last week, weighed by increased expectations of early interest rate hikes after consumer price data showed inflation running at historic levels. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.6%, the broad-based S&P 500 closed 0.3% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 0.7%.
U.S. inflation has surged to the highest level in over 30 years and data on Friday showed that consumer sentiment fell to its lowest in a decade this month, as higher prices eroded living standards. 
With this in mind, investors will focus on October retail sales data, due out on Tuesday, with economists expecting an increase of 1.1%, after a 0.7% rise in September.
Additionally, a number of major retailers, including  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Walmart (NYSE:WMT),   Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Macy’s (NYSE:M), are due to report quarterly earnings this week, with extra scrutiny likely ahead of the start of the holiday shopping season.
Ahead of this, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight after CEO Elon Musk sold more of the electric car manufacturer’s stock on Friday, bringing his total sales for the week to 6.4 million shares amounting to $6.9 billion.
Also of interest Monday will be the virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, given the level of distrust that currently exists between the globe’s two economic powerhouses.
Crude prices fell Monday, weighed by the possibility of additional U.S. supply as well as the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
Speculation that the Biden administration will authorize the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cool prices has been rife since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies decided to stick to its plan of a gradual output increase at its last meeting earlier this month.
Additionally, the U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by six to 556 in the week to Nov. 12, its highest level since April 2020, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.
By 7:05 AM ET, the January U.S. crude futures contract traded 1.4% lower at $78.58 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.6% to $80.88. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,864.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1450.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",Samsung's Lee visits U.S ahead of likely $17 billion chip plant decision-media,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) vice chairman Jay Y. Lee is visiting North America in his first high-profile trip after serving jail time for bribery, with a decision imminent on the company's planned $17 billion U.S. chip plant. 
Lee left Seoul on Sunday and his trip to Canada and the United States is expected to coincide with a decision on the location of the new plant, Yonhap and other local media said. 
A site in Texas' Williamson County, near the city of Taylor, offered the better incentives package among various sites Samsung (KS:005930) has been considering for the new chip plant that is set to make advanced logic chips, sources previously told Reuters. 
Since Samsung vice chairman Kim Kinam confirmed the chip plant plan in May, Samsung has been comparing incentives and working out who pays what in convoluted land and other agreements, while also considering the available amount of stable utilities such as water and electricity, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
The source declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. 
A winter storm in the first quarter hit Samsung's chip plant in Austin, Texas, laying bare the importance of stable utilities, as a shutdown caused by blackouts affected wafers corresponding to around 300-400 billion won ($254-339 million) of damages. 
""I am set to meet many U.S. partners,"" Lee told reporters before his flight on Sunday, without elaborating. 
He said he also expected to visit Boston, where COVID-19 vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s headquarters are located. 
Last month, South Korea granted emergency use approval for Moderna's vaccine produced by drugmaker Samsung BioLogics, which has a ""fill and finish"" deal with Moderna. 

Lee was convicted in January of bribery and embezzlement and sentenced to 30 months in jail - including a year served before his sentencing. Upon his parole in August, the presidential office said it expected Lee will help the country procure ""semiconductors and vaccines"".

545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>","If Elon Musk Is Modern Day Henry Ford, He’ll Have to Prove It in Germany","(Bloomberg) -- Two years after Elon Musk elicited audible gasps from an awards show audience with his surprise announcement that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. would build a factory outside Berlin, the project is nearing fruition and the hype has never been more palpable.
One analyst recently compared the series of innovations Musk is pursuing at the plant with Henry Ford’s revolutionary moving assembly line. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s chief executive officer this month expressed worry Tesla will be able to crank out an electric car in a third of the time it’s taking his company — a disparity that would jeopardize jobs.
Musk has billed the novelties Tesla is working on as transformative to the structural design of its vehicles. He wants to use massive machines — as long as a semitrailer and tall as a two-story home — to produce front and rear body parts using single pieces of metal. Pulling this off would save time and cost, reduce weight and improve driving range.
All this buzz will sound familiar to those who followed the launch of the Model 3 a few years back. The perennially promotional Musk touted an effort to build a highly automated “alien dreadnought” manufacturing system that went disastrously awry and nearly bankrupted Tesla. Today, the company has vastly more resources to support its CEO’s desire to push the envelope with regard to how cars are made.
“The big picture here is that Tesla has the opportunity to completely reinvent the car manufacturing process for vehicle production and factories,” Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley’s top auto analyst, wrote in a report last month. “Tesla is building the car factory of the future.”
Musk summed up Tesla’s pursuit in a simple way early this year. “With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made,” he tweeted in January.
On billboards strewn about Tesla’s factory when it opened to the public for a day last month, Tesla said it would inject aluminum into the world’s largest die-casting machines, which will then clamp the metal using 6,100 tons of pressure — a force equivalent to 1,020 African elephants standing on the tool to form parts.
The plant will house eight of these machines, with Musk aiming to eventually stamp out the two biggest parts of its Model Y sport utility vehicles — the front and rear underbodies — each with just one piece of metal. The current Model 3, by contrast, comprises 70 metal pieces just for the rear underbody.
While Musk has used a term for these machines — “Giga press” — that suggests Tesla conjured them in-house, this isn’t the case. The company has been buying them from Idra Group, a closely held Italian company that’s sold them to three customers on three continents and is in talks with other carmakers and major suppliers.
The front and rear castings will interface with frames beneath Model Ys that will house batteries built into the structure of the vehicle. This, too, could be a step change — Tesla and other EV makers have to this point been housing their batteries in sheet metal, then sealing those coverings to separate floorpans.
Musk touted the ramifications of simpler and more integrated battery and body manufacturing during Tesla’s “Battery Day” event last year. He claimed the company could reduce investment per gigawatt hour of battery output by 55% and shrink the amount of plant-floor space needed by 35%.
For all the upside Musk has described, he’s also acknowledged Tesla will be gambling in Gruenheide, a town about an hour’s drive east of the German capital.
“Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk,” Musk tweeted in October of last year. Tesla’s plants in Shanghai and Fremont, California, will attempt the same transitions in about two years, when the new tech is proven, he wrote at the time.
Five months after that post, a “Giga press” in Fremont was involved in a minor fire. The machine melts aluminum alloy at up to 850 degrees Celsius (1,530 degrees Fahrenheit) before the metal is moved into an only somewhat less-hot holding oven. Morgan Stanley’s Jonas wrote in his Oct. 24 report that the manufacturing process is tricky in part because the alloy must enter at a speed that ensures even cooling across the structure.
Germany’s automakers are watching Tesla’s progress closely. VW may build a new EV factory near its sprawling Wolfsburg headquarters in direct response to Musk’s foray.
Earlier this month, VW’s CEO Herbert Diess sought to rally his workers for the challenge. He warned Tesla may manage to make an EV in just 10 hours, versus the more than 30 hours VW needs at its plant in Zwickau. VW’s new factory would make 250,000 EVs a year and aim to catch up to Tesla on production time.
Morgan Stanley’s Jonas last month increased his forecast for how many cars Tesla will crank out annually by the end of the decade by 2.35 million, citing his expectation that Tesla will produce an average of more than 800,000 vehicles per plant by 2030. That’s far greater than the capacity for 500,000 units the company claims for its Fremont factory now.
“We have yet to see the ‘moving assembly line moment’ in the EV industry,” Jonas wrote, referring to Henry Ford’s 1913 breakthrough. “We believe the time is approaching for that moment. And we believe Tesla is uniquely positioned to push the boundaries at the epicenter of a manufacturing change in auto making.”
BMW AG’s production chief Milan Nedeljkovic told reporters at an event last month that the carmaker hasn’t worked with big casting components like Tesla, in part because this would reduce the flexibility it needs to produce several different kinds of models on the same assembly lines. Tesla’s new approaches intrigue him, nonetheless.
“If it works, maybe it’s something we’d consider,” Nedeljkovic said.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",Santa Claus is coming to town – but at what cost to Walmart and Target?,"By Richa Naidu and Aishwarya Venugopal
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pent-up demand is expected to have boosted early holiday sales this year, but big discounters Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) may still see margins fall as surging costs for labor, warehousing and ocean and land freight threaten to play Grinch.
Retailers have been under tremendous pressure from investors to control costs amid uncertainty driven by the pandemic. Shipping logjams, shuttered factories in China and Vietnam, and a scarcity of raw materials have ripped through supply chains in the United States in recent months, and left companies scrambling to make sure they have enough product for the crucial holiday shopping season.
For the third quarter, both costs of goods sold and selling, general and advertising expenses for Target are expected to rise about 10%, while Walmart's operating expenses are expected to rise nearly 4% to $28.57 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, will report earnings on Tuesday, while Target is scheduled to post results on Wednesday.
Late last month, ecommerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it expects costs during the holiday period to reach about $4 billion as higher wages and other operational disruptions diminish the company's windfall from online shopping.
""It is one competitive market for labor, freight, and customers. We believe most will be prudent in guiding to fourth-quarter profitability even with healthy sales,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich said.
RISING RENTS, WAGES
Industry warehouse rents are expected to rise 18-19% this year, according to real estate investment trust  Prologis  (NYSE:PLD), whose customers include Walmart, Amazon and Target. For the full year, analysts expect Walmart’s rent expenses to rise 7% to $3.28 billion, according to Refinitiv.
“Importers of clothing and footwear are paying essentially double what they were paying for transportation before the pandemic,” according to Jason Miller, associate professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. 
Insurance and freight costs crept up to 6.4% of the value of the imported products in September 2021, versus 3.7% in September 2019, according to Miller, who analyzed data from USA Trade Online, which is maintained by the Census Bureau.
Logistics expenses are also on the rise as retailers need to get more products around the country to satiate growing consumer demand, Mark Manduca, chief investment officer at logistics firm GXO, whose clients include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Meanwhile, a competitive labor environment has pushed wages up across the country.
Still, experts and analysts have said that retailers with bigger scale are better placed to tide over these supply chain issues and pass on higher prices to the buyers.

""Everybody's facing higher expenses but Walmart also has a much more efficient supply chain - they should have a very good holiday season, even with all the cost pressure,"" Telsey Group analyst Joe Feldman said.
U.S. holiday sales could rise as much as 10.5% to $859 billion, according to one forecast.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-Chile copper giants seek stability in uncertain political times,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s mining sector is looking for certainty amid political fog in the world’s top copper producer, which is redrafting its constitution and on Sunday is headed for a polarized vote led by outsider candidates on the far left and right.
The front-runners have kept their powder dry on copper in the campaign https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-campaign-trail-goes-virtual-all-two-candidates-forced-into-covid-lockdown-2021-11-04 so far, hinting at hikes to royalties on mining profits. There has also been vague talk from far-right poll leader José Antonio Kast to allow more private investment in state miner Codelco.
The Nov. 21 presidential vote, the first since months of angry protests over inequality https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-protests-explainer/explainer-chiles-inequality-challenge-what-went-wrong-and-can-it-be-fixed-idUSKBN1X22RK rocked Chile in 2019, has become a polarized battle between a leftist coalition led by 35-year-old protest leader Gabriel Boric https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-leftist-presidential-candidate-boric-tests-positive-covid-19-2021-11-03 and ultraconservative Kast https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-conservative-kast-maintains-lead-final-pre-election-opinion-polls-2021-11-06.
The battle will be key for the mining sector, which has increasingly come under the spotlight in the region as governments looked to bolster state coffers to drive an economic rebound after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Kast and Boric are from outside Chile's mainstream political parties, with voter anger over pensions, healthcare, education and costs driving demand for change - similar to the abrupt rise of former teacher President Pedro Castillo https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/perus-castillo-mulls-cabinet-reshuffle-under-pressure-opposition-2021-08-24 in neighboring Peru.
""There are candidacies that are at opposite extremes and there is talk of a polarization as a factor that can make any next government complex,"" said Alejandra Wood, Santiago-based executive director of the Center for Copper Studies (CESCO).
""The presidential campaign adds uncertainty,"" she added.
The country is already debating a new constitution https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-begins-down-uncertain-road-writing-new-constitution-2021-05-17 and a controversial mining royalty bill https://www.reuters.com/article/chile-copper/royalty-bill-will-put-chiles-private-miners-out-of-business-trade-group-says-idUSL1N2PW1QR, which could sharply hike tariffs on the sector. A new glacier protection law, which could impact some key mines, also still needs to be defined.
Chile is the world's No. 1 producer of copper and one of the biggest suppliers of electric battery metal lithium, with demand rising amid a global shift toward electric vehicles.
Kast and Boric are the favorites to make it to a second-round run-off. If no candidate gets a simple majority on Sunday, the top two will compete in a head-to-head ballot on Dec. 19. A host of legislative and regional offices are also up for grabs in Sunday's election. 
'INVESTMENT DROUGHT'
Francisco Acuña, analyst at industry consultancy CRU, said most candidates were aligned on plans to improve sustainability and lower emissions from mining, though there was little clarity on specific measures to achieve it. 
Left-wing candidates like Boric and Senator Yasna Provoste have discussed royalties while Kast has proposed vague changes to mining property law to rev up the sector, including opening up state miner Codelco to more private investment.
""The risk is the uncertainty because there is no clear idea yet of what changes would look like,"" Acuña said.
Diego Hernández, president of the National Mining Society (Sonami), which represents firms in the sector, told Reuters that whoever won the presidential race would need more investment in mining to propel growth, so they would need to sit down and negotiate terms. 
Hernández said Kast, Provoste and center-right Sebastián Sichel appeared to recognize the importance of mining in different forms, though they criticized Boric's talks of a more productive role for the State as ""confusing.""
""With all the needs that the country has, we know that this (large state investments) is not available. Deep down there is a lack of maturity or reality,"" he said.
Hernández said the elections would spark legal uncertainty, which could lead to a period of ""investment drought"" that could delay the availability of new copper and lithium to meet the expected increase in demand.
The government has projected mining investments of about $70 billion through the end of the decade, most from private firms.

CESCO's Wood said the sector needed clarity quickly to help make sure developments moved ahead.
""I think the industry is waiting for signals of greater certainty and stability to make investment decisions,"" she said.

MARKET REACTION: Shares in Royal Dutch Shell rose 2.2% in European trade after the announcement.
COMMENTS:
STUART JOYNER, SPECIALIST SALES AT REDBURN
""(The proposal) will allow faster buybacks and bring Shell's tax residency into line with its country of incorporation in the United Kingdom. This is a clear post-Brexit win for the UK.
""It is unclear what leaving the Netherlands will mean for the Dutch litigation process given sizeable operations will remain.""
PEER DE RIJK, ENERGY AND CLIMATE JUSTICE CAMPAIGNER AT MILIEUDEFENSIE/FRIENDS OF THE EARTH NETHERLANDS
""This news has no negative consequences for Milieudefensie’s climate case against Shell. In any case, this lawsuit will remain with the Dutch courts. In our view, this also has no implications for future cases at home and abroad. Around the world, companies have the responsibility to respect human rights and prevent dangerous climate change.
""Rather, moving to the United Kingdom opens up a new front, including for future cases.""
ANALYSTS AT BERNSTEIN
""Ultimately, the proposals spell good news for investors and will help accelerate Shell's share buyback programme and the delivery of its strategy to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050. (The proposals) will increase the pool of ordinary shares available for purchase and hence accelerate shareholder distributions in the form of buybacks. 
""Aligning its share structure with peers could in theory double the volume of share buybacks that Shell can implement per quarter from $2-2.5 bln up to $5 bln per quarter, we think.""
""Moreover, the change will allow greater flexibility including M&A and demergers while helping Shell achieve its ambition to become net-zero.""
LAURA HOY, EQUITY ANALYST AT HARGREAVES LANSDOWN
""Ultimately, the new structure would be a net positive for shareholders as it will streamline the company and make it easier to manoeuvre moving forward. Aside from the fact that the shares they hold will no longer come with a ‘Royal’ designation, this new alignment won’t change much for investors. 
""The long-term growth story for Shell still rests heavily on the oil price. For now, buoyant oil prices are keeping the group’s cash coffers topped up, which has had a positive impact on debt and given the group the means to boost shareholder returns. 
""However, with the inevitable shift to more sustainable energy picking up steam we suspect the need to invest in greener operations will keep a lid on what the group can pass on to shareholders.""
ANALYSTS AT JEFFERIES
""We see merits in the proposed restructuring of Shell's shares structure and tax residence. Among other benefits, the proposed changes will increase Shell's ability to buy back shares which was until now constrained by Class B shares liquidity.
""This is an important point ahead of the start of the $7bn buyback programme related to the Permian divestment and in the context of a potential increase in size of the ordinary buyback (from the current $1bn/quarter).""
STEF BLOK, DUTCH ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND CLIMATE MINISTER.
""The Cabinet regrets to the utmost that Shell wants to move its head office to the United Kingdom. We are in a dialogue with the management of Shell over the consequences of this plan for jobs, crucial investment decisions and sustainability.""
ADAM MATTHEWS, CHIEF RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OFFICER, CHURCH OF ENGLAND PENSIONS BOARD
""If this decision will enable the company to be more agile in order to execute its transition to net zero, then it should be viewed positively. We would be keen to understand how this will drive a more ambitious transition in line with the steps the company still need to take as we outlined in our statement at Shell’s AGM.""

Japan's largest lender has also benefited from ""strong stock markets and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)"", MUFG Chief Executive Hironori Kamezawa told an earnings briefing after the Wall Street bank in which it has a 20% stake had a stellar quarter.
MUFG hiked its profit estimate for the year to end-March by nearly a quarter to 1.05 trillion yen ($9.2 billion), ahead of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 982 billion.
Kamezawa stressed, however, that the bank needed to ""boost its earnings power in its main businesses"" if it is to achieve in a more normal business environment its goal of more than 1 trillion yen in net profit by the year ending March 2024.
Shunsaku Sato, a senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, said if the impact of equity-method gains - primarily Morgan Stanley's stake - was excluded, MUFG's pre-provision income during the first-half of the year declined 7%.
""This reflects the profitability challenges faced by MUFG and other Japanese banks in the current ultralow domestic interest rate environment,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
FEW BANKRUPTCIES
Like a many other banks worldwide, this quarter's earnings were inflated by the release of cash from provisions that had been set aside last year to deal with a potential flood of pandemic-related bad loans.
Corporate bankruptcies in Japan, however, fell to their lowest ever for an April-September period after the government provided small businesses with cash to cushion them from the worst effects of lockdowns, according to Tokyo Shoko Research.
For the July-September quarter, MUFG's net profit surged 83% to 398.4 billion yen. The two other Japanese megabanks, Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc (SMFG) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc also lifted their full-year profit forecasts when they reported last week.
MUFG added it would buy back up to 150 billion yen or 2.33% of its outstanding shares by the end of March.

Though the Japanese bank has pulled back from U.S. retail banking with the $8 billion sale of MUFG Union Bank to U.S. Bancorp, it has said the United States remains a key market.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 2.3% lower in Monday’s premarket after news late on Friday that CEO Elon Musk continued to unload the shares.
Musk sold 1.2 million shares on Friday, bringing his total sales for the week to 6.4 million, worth a cumulative $6.9 billion. 
Musk, who faces a large tax bill after exercising options awarded him as compensation, had hinted the previous weekend that he would sell up to $20 billion worth of stock. around one-tenth of his overall holding. As such, the overhang in the stock is still far from resolved. Various reports peg Musk’s tax bill at $10 billion, suggesting that he may have to sell some more stock yet to meet his obligations. 
Musk has used the episode to snipe at Democratic lawmakers, who aim to include a levy on unrealized stock gains to help fund their spending plans.  On Sunday, he trolled Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders in response to the Senator’s tweet that said, “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.”
“Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word,” Musk wrote.
Musk has more than 20 million further stock options that are due to expire in August of next year, according to Reuters. Most of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock and the unlisted SpaceX."

Investing.com – Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) announced plans on Monday to simplify its share structure to establish a single line of shares, breaking with over a century of tradition in an effort to streamline costs and improve shareholder returns.
The company said it will also move its tax residence to the U.K. from the Netherlands, and likely remove the words 'Royal Dutch' from its name. Board and executive committee meetings will from now on also take place in the U.K. Shell, which has been incorporated in the U.K. with a Dutch tax residence and a dual share structure since 2005, said the measures will make it simpler for investors to understand and value the company, and allow it to compete more effectively.
The measures are consistent with a general pattern amongst oil and gas majors against the backdrop of the pandemic and the long-term shift away from fossil fuels. Shell was forced to slash capital spending, sell assets and even cut its dividend for the first time since World War 2 as oil prices collapsed last year. The need to reallocate investment resources to cleaner technologies over the long run has only reinforced the need to eliminate structural inefficiencies.
The company said the creation of a larger single pool of ordinary shares will make it easier for it to speed up buybacks.
“The simplification will normalize our share structure under the tax and legal jurisdictions of a single country and make us more competitive,"" said Shell’s Chair, Sir Andrew McKenzie. ""As a result, Shell will be better positioned to seize opportunities and play a leading role in the energy transition.”
The Board has unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposed resolution at the General Meeting on 10th December 2021. The proposal will require at least 75% of shareholders to vote in favor to pass.
The proposed changes have been welcomed by the UK government.
“Welcome news Shell is proposing to relocate its Group HQ to the United Kingdom as part of their plans to accelerate the transition to clean energy,” UK Business and Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). “A clear vote of confidence in the British economy as we work to strengthen competitiveness, attract investment and create jobs.”


The news received less support in the Netherlands, where Economic Affairs and Climate Minister Stef Blok said the Dutch government was “unpleasantly surprised” by the proposals.
The move reflects the changing position of the Netherlands in the company's structure. With the planned closure of the Groningen field, the largest in western Europe, the Netherlands is no longer a major production center of hydrocarbons. However, the company pointed to numerous renewable and carbon-offsetting projects in the country and said it will ""continue to be a significant employer in the Netherlands.""
The planned revamp comes just weeks after activist hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) announced it had initiated a position in Shell and urged the company to increase shareholder value, even at the cost of breaking up the company.
Third Point, which is headed by Dan Loeb, urged Shell to create multiple standalone companies, such as a standalone energy business and a separate renewables business, saying it would “likely lead to an acceleration of CO2 reduction as well as significantly increased returns for shareholders, a win for all stakeholders.”
Although the new structure could be seen as a net positive for shareholders, the long-term growth story rests heavily on the oil price, according to Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Laura Hoy.
“For now, buoyant oil prices are keeping the group’s cash coffers topped up, which has had a positive impact on debt and given the group the means to boost shareholder returns,” Hoy said in an emailed note. “However, with the inevitable shift to more sustainable energy picking up steam we suspect the need to invest in greener operations will keep a lid on what the group can pass on to shareholders.”
Shell shares welcomed the news. At 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), its London-listed A shares were up 1.8% at 1,673 pence a share, their biggest gain in a week."

558,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese embassy lobbies U.S. business to oppose China bills - sources,"By Michael Martina
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has been pushing U.S. executives, companies and business groups in recent weeks to fight against China-related bills in the U.S. Congress, four sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters, in letters to and meetings with a wide range of actors in the business community. 
China's embassy in Washington had sent letters pressing executives to urge members of Congress to alter or drop specific bills that seek to enhance U.S. competitiveness, according to the sources and the text of a letter sent by the embassy's economic and commercial office seen by Reuters. 
Chinese officials warned companies they would risk losing market share or revenue in China if the legislation becomes law, according to the text of the letter.
The sources said China's request also left some individuals who received a letter concerned that they could be seen as violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) if they lobbied lawmakers on similar issues in the future.
As a result, none of the sources wanted to be identified as having received or seen the letter.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in response to a request for comment that certain bills distorted facts and were based on ""Cold War thinking."" If passed, he said, they would harm bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries. 
""China has always resolutely opposed this,"" he said at a daily briefing in Beijing. 
Sweeping U.S. legislation to boost competition with China and fund much-needed semiconductor production, known as the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. A related bill in the House of Representatives called the Eagle Act, which is more strictly policy focused, has stalled as Congress has been preoccupied with other domestic initiatives.
The language in the letters, which Reuters determined were sent separately to a wide number of people, explicitly asks companies to oppose USICA and the Eagle Act.
'NEGATIVE BILLS'
Beijing sees the measures, which take a hard line toward China on human rights and trade issues, as part of a U.S. effort to counter its growing economic and geopolitical might.
""We sincerely hope you ... will play a positive role in urging members of Congress to abandon the zero-sum mindset and ideological prejudice, stop touting negative China-related bills, delete negative provisions, so as to create favorable conditions for bilateral economic and trade cooperation before it is too late,"" the Chinese embassy said in one letter sent in early November.
Reuters confirmed the shared language of the letter with the four sources.
""The result of those China-related bills with negative impacts will not be that the interests of U.S. companies will be protected while those of Chinese companies will suffer. It is only going to hurt everyone,"" it said.
""Promoting a China-free supply chain will inevitably result in a decline in China's demand for U.S. products and American companies loss of market share and revenue in China,"" it said.
Two of the sources said similar messages were conveyed in meetings with staff of China's embassy.

""It's an outright ask by a foreign government,"" one of the sources said, highlighting the implications for FARA, which requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign power or political party to disclose those relations to the Department of Justice.
A second source said the approach appeared geared at getting companies to delay the legislative process rather than block the bills entirely.

A total of 81 stocks started trading https://www.reuters.com/article/china-exchange-idUSL1N2S30M3 to mark the official launch of the exchange - which has been set up to serve small and medium-sized enterprises https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-stocks-exchange-idUSKBN2HK0E7 (SMEs), underpinning President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" policy aimed at reducing wealth gaps in the country.
""It's a pretty good performance for the first day. I don't see a lot of froth,"" said Yang Hongxun, an analyst at investment consultancy Shenguang. ""With President Xi endorsing the exchange, I see little chance of this market failing.""
Performance was mixed for the other 71 stocks, which were transferred to the new bourse from the 'select tier' of Beijing's over-the-counter New Third Board.
The launch of the Beijing exchange is a landmark in China's capital market reforms, said Yi Huiman, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
""It's significant as it will enhance multi-layered capital market, improve financing system for SMEs and drive innovation and upgrade China's economy,"" Yi told a ceremony on Monday.
The Beijing exchange complements existing bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen that host companies with bigger market capitalisations. 
More than 4 million investors have opened accounts to trade on the Beijing Stock Exchange, which adopts a registration-based IPO mechanism - a system also embraced by Shenzhen's ChiNext and Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market.
Companies listed on the Beijing exchange, if qualified, can directly migrate to ChiNext, or STAR. 
CIRCUIT BREAKER 
At the end of trading on Monday, all the 10 newly-listed stocks registered hefty gains. But 59 of the 71 stocks that were transferred from the 'select tier' fell.
""Capital is chasing the new stocks, while existing shareholders on the 'select tier' are taking profit,"" said Zhou Yunnan, a veteran investor in the New Third Board.
The first batch of companies listed on the bourse are mainly from sectors such as software, pharmaceutical and high-end manufacturing.
Turnover on the Beijing exchange was 9.57 billion yuan ($ 1.5 billion) on the first trading day, just 1% of the combined daily turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Henan Tongxin Transmission Co, which makes automobile transmission devises, led with a 494% gain, data from the Beijing Stock Exchange showed.
Nantong Great Electric Co Ltd, HeBei Raisesun Information Technology Co, and Anhui Jingsai Technology Co more than tripled. 
The spikes triggered circuit breakers or temporary halts in the trading of the 10 stocks. 
Investors with assets worth at least 500,000 yuan ($78,347) in their stock account can apply to trade in the Beijing Stock Exchange - a threshold on par with Shanghai's STAR Market.
More cash is expected to flow in. 

Eight mutual funds targeting the Beijing exchange have completed registration, according to CSRC.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) relaunched flights to India this week, nearly a decade after stopping them, looking to capitalise on growing demand for non-stop travel amid the coronavirus pandemic, a senior executive of the airline told Reuters.
With travel demand bouncing back at home, American Airlines wants to expand its international network and India was ""one of the biggest untapped markets"" for it, said Tom Lattig, managing director of EMEA sales.
""A lot of customers really want to fly non-stop, particularly as we've come through the pandemic. We know there is huge demand for travel between India and the United States so there is an opportunity right now in the middle of the pandemic to come back,"" Lattig said in an interview in New Delhi.
American Airlines, which suspended services to India in 2012, started flying between New Delhi and New York on the weekend and will add flights between India's tech city of Bengaluru and Seattle in March. 
If it succeeds with those two routes, it will add services to India's financial capital of Mumbai, Lattig said. 
The expansion would also depend on the availability of aircraft as it awaits deliveries of wide-body aircraft from Boeing (NYSE:BA), he said.
""There are more opportunities than we actually have aircraft for,"" Lattig said.
The U.S. carrier is already flying 90% of its pre-pandemic capacity at home and has even deployed widebody planes on some routes, Lattig said.
Demand from Europe and Britain was also strong, especially after the United States opened its borders last week, and demand from Mexico and parts of Latin America had exceeded 2019 levels, he said.
But the airline had yet to see any meaningful recovery in Asia, where it is flying less than 25% of pre-pandemic capacity, Lattig said, adding that the slow rate of vaccinations in the region was partly to blame.
Most of the current demand globally is from those visiting friends and family or for leisure. Lattig expected it would be the end of 2023 before corporate travel recovers to 2019 levels, with Asia being the slowest region to bounce back.
Lattig said as American Airlines looks to establish a presence in India, it was banking on its service and a four-class cabin to better compete with rivals like Air India, which was acquired by India's Tata Group, and United Airlines - both offering direct flights to the United States.

The airline will also leverage its partnership with U.S. low-cost carrier JetBlue and code share with India's biggest airline - budget carrier IndiGo - to feed its network by connecting travellers from multiple cities. 
""We're going be the newcomer and we are going to be aggressive about establishing a place for ourselves,"" Lattig said.

(Reuters) -  Sonova Holding AG  (OTC:SONVY), the world's biggest maker of hearing aids, on Monday reported first-half core profit above analysts' expectations and maintained its full-year guidance as business picked up from a pandemic dip, but warned of supply chain constraints.
The Switzerland-based company said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) hit 406 million Swiss francs ($442 million), above the 386 million francs expected on average by analysts in a company-provided poll.
During the early part of the pandemic, patients were deterred from seeing doctors or audiologists by lockdown restrictions and fear of infection, but many have started to seek treatment again as they gain confidence in protective measures taken in stores.
The company maintained full-year targets of a 24%-28% increase in sales and adjusted EBITA growth of 34-42%, despite some analysts expecting it to lift the forecasts. 
Although JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it had expected bigger sales and earnings beats, it called the decision to reiterate the 2021/22 guidance ""quite conservative"".
Sonova said it had faced shortages of microelectronic components towards the end of the first half.
""We have included the current supply chain issues in our full-year guidance,"" Chief Executive Arnd Kaldowski told Reuters in an interview, adding that if problems in the second half remained at a similar level to those in August and September, the company would be ready for them.
The disruptions to the global economy during the pandemic have upset supply chains across continents, causing shortages of goods and services, including microelectronic components used for hearing aid.
Sonova shares were down 3.2% by 0850 GMT.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Supermarket group Ahold Delhaize said on Monday it wanted to spin off its 5.5 billion euro ($6.3 billion) Dutch online retail business Bol.com, which is competing with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and to list its shares in the second half of next year.
Ahold, which operates in the United States and Europe, said it would retain control over the Netherlands' dominant internet shop in the years to come, as it would only list an unspecified limited number of shares.
The move should allow Bol.com to retain its edge over U.S. rival Amazon, which has expanded its market share in the Netherlands in recent years. 
""We see an opportunity for Bol to grow faster"", Chief Executive Officer Frans Muller told reporters.
""Both Bol and Amazon in the Dutch market gained share, but the gap we had ahead of Amazon has not changed over time,"" he added, without providing exact numbers.
Ahold Delhaize shares opened up 4.5% on Monday, leading the blue AEX-index in Amsterdam.
""We believe the Bol.com IPO could provide an additional trigger for the stock"", KBS Securities analysts said.
""We would not be surprised to see a valuation of over 5 billion euros (for Bol.com).""
The owner of the Stop & Shop, Giant, Food Lion and Hannaford chains said Bol.com's revenues and core earnings (EBITDA) were expected to double by 2025, relative to the 5.5 billion euros and around 170 million euros respectively expected for this year.
Muller said around 48,000 Dutch businesses offer their products over the Bol.com platform, which is also active in Belgium.
The second-largest Dutch online retailer, Coolblue, last month shelved https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/dutch-online-retailer-coolblue-postpones-ipo-due-market-conditions-2021-10-13 its plans for an IPO due to uncertain market conditions.
SHARE BUYBACK AND SALES GROWTH
Ahead of its annual investors day, Ahold also announced a new share buyback worth 1 billion euros starting next year and said it expected its overall sales to continue to grow in 2022.
Sales growth in the 2023-2025 period will accelerate, the company said, as it aims to add 10 billion euros in revenue by 2025.
Total sales of the operator of the dominant Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Delhaize in Belgium were almost 75 billion euros last year.

Ahold expects online sales to reach 20 billion euros by 2025, Muller said, which is roughly double the previous target for that year.

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) said on Monday it has hired its first head of telecom carrier partnerships, as the parent company of photo messaging app Snapchat seeks to bolster its growth outside the United States.
The Santa Monica, California-based company has seen steady expansion internationally after improving its app on Android phones, which are more widely used than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS outside the United States. It now aims to accelerate growth by partnering with phone carriers in countries like Indonesia and India, where Snapchat recently hit a milestone of 100 million monthly users.
Anne Laurenson, who joins Snap from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), will serve as managing director of global carrier partnerships. She will be based in Paris and becomes the first Snap executive to lead a global team from outside the United States, the company said. 
While at Google, Laurenson oversaw the strategy to grow the Android operating system in Europe, Middle East and Africa through tie-ups with smartphone manufacturers and carriers in those regions.
Snap has employed that strategy to grow in India, a major growth market for social media and messaging apps. The company has partnered with top Android phone manufacturers in the country such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Oppo, which pre-install Snapchat on their phones.

Snap has also inked deals to promote the adoption of its camera and augmented reality features. Google and Indian telecom firm Jio integrated Snapchat's lenses, which can overlay visual effects onto photos and videos, in its recently launched smartphone JioPhone Next.

'Don't fight the Fed', goes the old saying.
Investors tempted to challenge the U.S. Federal Reserve's narrative on transitory inflation might want to read Russell Clark's final letter to investors while listening to the rock anthem 'I fought the law'.
After another monthly loss at the hedge fund which bears his name, Clark decided to wind up his fund, deploring that global markets are increasingly driven by politics, notably China's, for which he admits having no particular edge. 
""U.S. markets are essentially a bet on the Fed unable to raise rates, and Congress unable to regulate big tech or raise corporate tax rates"", he wrote in his October newsletter.
Indeed, many hedge funds expected the Fed and other central banks to quickly turn hawkish and have been forced to cover bets when caught on the wrong side of the trade. 
The impact of the 6.2% year-on-year rise in U.S. inflation in October on the Fed's thinking has proven tricky to call as President Joe Biden weighs whether to keep Jerome Powell as chair for a second term or elevate Fed Governor Lael Brainard to the post. 
Amid uncertainty on central banks' next move, gold prices slipped this morning from a five-month peak. 
Yields for 10-year U.S. Treasury notes are at about 1.55% while the euro zone's benchmark, German 10-year yields is at -0.26%, highlighting how far behind the European Central Bank is in the tightening cycle. 
At 95, the dollar index is close to highs unseen since July 2020 while the euro, by contrast, is trading at 16-month lows. The dollar's strength has also weighed on oil prices.
Meanwhile, global equity markets are trading at a whisker from their record highs as Asian shares crept higher on Monday, boosted by positive Chinese economic data. 
For their part, futures for European equities are just slightly in the red less than an hour ahead of cash trading. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
- China industrial output, retail sales accelerate but property clouds outlook
- Japan's economy shrinks more than expected as supply shortages hit

- India's Oct WPI inflation accelerates to five-month high of 12.54% y/y 
- UK Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) house prices

Helping the tone Monday was the news that China's industrial output and retail sales grew more quickly than expected in October, despite fresh curbs to control Covid-19 outbreaks in the world’s second-largest economy and key regional growth driver.
Back in Europe, Sonova (SIX:SOON), the world's biggest maker of hearing aids, on Monday reported strong first-half core profit, citing a solid market recovery after the coronavirus pandemic.
 Telenor  (OL:TEL) will also be in the spotlight Monday after the Norwegian telecom company announced Monday that it has formed a partnership with Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud to digitalise its global operations.
Elsewhere, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will appear before the European Parliament later on Monday. 
Crude prices fell Monday, weighed by the possibility of additional U.S. supply as well as the continued strength of the U.S. dollar.
Speculation that the Biden administration will authorize the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cool prices has been rife since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies decided to stick to its plan of a gradual output increase at its last meeting earlier this month.
Additionally, the U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by six to 556 in the week to Nov. 12, its highest level since April 2020, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.

OSLO (Reuters) - Telenor and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud have formed a partnership to digitalise the Norwegian telecom company's global operations and are exploring ways to jointly offer services to customers, the two companies said on Monday.
The firms will not only use Google Cloud's services to boost Telenor's own IT and network, but also collaborate to provide Telenor's customers with digital tools, their respective chief executives told Reuters.
Oslo-based Telenor serves 172 million customers with roughly half its revenue generated in Asia and half in the Nordics.
The digitalisation project will mean a big transformation for Telenor, but is also part of its ambition to find new revenue streams, Telenor's CEO Sigve Brekke said.
""I think the future for telcos is to move beyond connectivity, and to create value on top of connecting customers,"" he said.
With networks increasingly reliant on software, Telenor needs to build a cloud-based business, and Google's abilities in providing data management knowledge, machine learning and artificial intelligence make it a good fit, Brekke added.
""To digitalise our operation is to make it smoother,"" Brekke said. ""You can predict outages before they happen... when you're displacing some of your backend processes, you can smooth out customer experiences and make them better.""
Digitalising the core operations of a telecommunications company as large as Telenor is new to Google Cloud and so are the joint customer offerings, said Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud. 
Among the first services the two envisage providing jointly is a platform to help small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transform to digital operations.

""This not just about optimising data centres and moving data centres to the cloud,"" Kurian said.
""The work that we're doing with SMEs...we are not just offering as a technology supplier, but building a joint offering to a customer segment.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Monday morning, with investors digesting the latest Chinese and Japanese economic data.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.17% by 9:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.18%. Economic data released earlier in the day in China showed that fixed asset investment grew 6.1% year-on-year, industrial production grew 3.5% year-on-year and retail sales grew 4.9% year-on-year in October. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.9%.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will reportedly hold a virtual summit with his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden on Monday, and the Beijing Stock Exchange also launched earlier in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.45%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the third quarter GDP contracted by a larger-than-expected 3% year-on-year and 0.8% quarter-on-quarter.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Indedx inched down 0.07% while South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.05%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.44%, with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to release the minutes from its November meeting on Tuesday.
U.S. Treasuries steadied following volatility that was a reflection of the uncertainty that surrounds the economic recovery from COVID-19. Investors are also focused on how much longer high inflation will last and central banks’ timelines for interest rate hikes.
Although global shares remain near record highs, some investors remain worried that persistently high inflation could prompt central banks to bring these timelines forward.
“We’ve seen inflation prints that we haven’t seen in decades,” UBS Private Wealth Management managing director Terri Jacobsen told Bloomberg.
Shares can continue rallying as global supply chain issues are resolved and corporate earnings stay strong, with the U.S. Federal Reserve staying patient on further monetary tightening, she added.
However, some central bank officials remain convinced that high inflation will remain temporary. The Fed should not overreact to high inflation even as it causes pain because it is likely to prove temporary, said Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said controlling COVID-19 in the U.S. will be crucial to easing inflationary pressures
Thomas Barkin, Esther George, Raphael Bostic, and Patrick Harker, who head the Fed Banks of Richmond, Kansas City, Atlanta, and Philadelphia respectively, will speak at various events on Tuesday. The U.S. also releases retail sales figures on Tuesday.

The Hong Kong unit of China Aoyuan Group Ltd. agreed to sell three property investment holding companies. Sunac is also planning to sell its vast culture and tourism business, people familiar with the matter said late last week. Yango Group Co. extended the expiration deadline for a dollar bond exchange offer. 
The spate of moves to improve liquidity comes amid investor concerns over the strength of the country’s largest property firms and their ability to refinance debt. Those worries abated slightly as Chinese junk dollar bonds continued to rebound late last week amid signals that authorities will offer support to ease the liquidity crunch.
Key Developments:
Yango Extends Exchange Offer Deadline to Nov. 17 (8 a.m. HK)
Yango Group has extended the expiration deadline for its dollar bond exchange offer and consent solicitations to 4 p.m. London time on Nov. 17, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. The settlement of new notes, delivery of exchange and consent consideration to eligible holders is scheduled on or about Nov. 23 under the new timetable. 
China Aoyuan to Sell Hong Kong Property Assets for HK$900m (7:43 a.m. HK)
Aoyuan Property (Hong Kong), a unit of China Aoyuan, agrees to sell three property investment holding companies and the loan they owe to the unit for cash to private investor Norman Ng Tang Fai, according to filing to Hong Kong stock exchange Sunday evening.
Assets of the holding companies comprise of flats and car parking spaces at Yin Yee Mansion on Robinson Road, Hong Kong Island. Aoyuan expected to recognize estimated loss of about HK$176.6 million ($22.7 million) from the sale. The company will use net proceeds for repayment of HK$600 million loan facility and general working capital.
Kaisa Group Will Not Pay Interim Dividend (7:35 a.m. HK)
The board of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. has resolved that the interim dividend will not be paid, it said in a filing late on Friday. Trading will remain halted until further notice.
Cash-strapped Kaisa is trying to sell property assets with an estimated value of $12.8 billion. Its slow progress on disposals has increased the likelihood it defaults on dollar-bond interest payments at some point, Fitch Ratings said in its latest downgrade last week, citing risks including undisclosed debt from wealth management products and declining sales. 
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said Thursday in its ratings cut that “a default scenario is inevitable within six months.”
China Developer Sunac Raises $953 Million; Chairman Issues Loan (7:22 a.m. HK)
Sunac raised about $953 million through the sale of new shares as well as a stake in its property management unit, the latest Chinese developer to seek funds amid an industry-wide liquidity crunch. It sold 335 million shares at a price of HK$15.18 each, raising about $653 million, in a statement Sunday, confirming an earlier story by Bloomberg News. 
Another $300 million came from a sale of 158 million shares in its property management arm Sunac Services Holdings Ltd., via a subsidiary. Sunac Services shares were sold at HK$14.75, a discount of 11% to Friday’s closing price.
China CBIRC to Maintain Stable Property Prices, Expectations (7:15 a.m. HK)
China will continue to curb the “financialization of real estate” and prevent the sector from turning into a bubble, the banking and insurance regulator says in a statement late Friday.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2021 07:11PM ET</span>","Insurers plan to up ramp up private market investments, BlackRock says","By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber
GLASGOW / NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers plan to increase their allocations to private markets to 14% from 11% over the next two years in the hunt for yield, as they add more money to environmentally focused investment funds, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) officials said. 
Charles Hatami, global head of the financial institutions group at the world's largest asset manager, described the trends in an interview with Reuters on Friday, based on a survey of 362 insurance executives running a collective $27 trillion in assets.
The results showed the insurance industry's embrace of risk will likely continue even after the easing of interest rate disruptions from the pandemic, Hatami said. In 2019, private market assets accounted for 7% of total allocations, the survey found.
""Insurance companies are adopting more risk appetite,"" Hatami said. 
BlackRock manages more than $500 billion on behalf of insurers, or 5% of its total assets of $9.5 trillion.
Alternative assets such as infrastructure, private equity and hedge funds have become more attractive to investors in recent years as central bank money printing kept interest rates low and returns weak in the investment grade bond market.
In all 60% of insurers plan to take on more risk by seeking out higher-yielding assets over the next two years, BlackRock said, the highest level since the company started tracking the information in 2015. 
The survey also found insurers almost uniformly said climate change will have a significant impact on portfolios, and they expect to raise their allocations to sustainable investments by about 30% over the next two years.

Hatami said areas like infrastructure and renewable energy projects like windfarms and solar energy have seen much new interest among insurers, who have put money into products like BlackRock's new Global Infrastructure Debt Fund.
Given the lower liquidity available in private markets, the survey also showed 41% of insurers plan to increase their stock-pile of cash - needed to pay out on everything from house fires to car accidents and personal injury.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>","China satisfied with Boeing 737 MAX changes, seeks industry feedback - document","By Stella Qiu and Yew Lun Tian
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's aviation regulator has told airlines it is satisfied that design changes Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co proposed for its 737 MAX plane could resolve safety problems, in a sign it is closer to lifting a more than two-year flight ban in Chinese skies.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) invited airlines to give feedback on a proposed airworthiness directive for the 737 MAX by Nov. 26, according to an undated notice seen by Reuters.
The directive outlines specific procedures for pilots to perform in case of problems similar to those that emerged in two deadly crashes before the plane's grounding in March 2019. It also lists all the systems that must be functioning in order for the plane to be dispatched.
A return to the skies in China, the world's biggest aircraft market, would be a major boon to Boeing. Broker Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in September an announcement would be worth a 5% boost to the stock price.
The United States and Europe last year sought industry feedback on similar proposed directives before ultimately approving the return of the 737 MAX.
CAAC's notice said after a comprehensive review of the changes Boeing proposed, including to the design of the aviation control software and display system, it assessed the changes could remove the unsafe situations that led to the crashes.
The agency did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the notice. A Boeing spokesperson said the airline continued to work with regulators around the world to return the 737 MAX to service.
The aerospace giant has said the 737 MAX performed a successful test flight for CAAC in August.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said last month the company was working toward gaining Chinese approvals by the end of the year for the 737 MAX to fly, with deliveries expected to resume in the first quarter of 2022. 
Around a third of about 370 undelivered 737 MAX airplanes in storage are for Chinese customers, Boeing said last month.
Before the 737 MAX was grounded, Boeing was selling one-quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers, its largest customer.

Other Asia-Pacific countries - including Singapore, Malaysia, India, Japan, Australia and Fiji - have already approved the return of the 737 MAX.
Beyond safety concerns, Boeing's sales in China have been hobbled by U.S.-China trade tensions, with Washington accusing Beijing of blocking purchases of Boeing planes by its domestic airlines.

Miami-based investment firm CGI Merchant Group is in contract to acquire the lease, the newspaper said.
The Trump International Hotel is in a historic building a few blocks from the White House that the Trump Organization leases from the U.S. government. The hotel has been a popular gathering spot for Trump supporters and foreign dignitaries.
The newspaper said CGI intends to remove the Trump name and has reached an agreement with  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) to have the property managed and branded by Hilton's Waldorf Astoria group.
The Trump organization, CGI Merchant and Hilton did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on Sunday.
Last month, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform said newly obtained government documents raised ""troubling"" questions about the hotel.
According to the Democratic-controlled committee, Trump reported that the hotel earned him more than $150 million during his time in office but actually lost more than $70 million.

The committee found that the hotel received more than $3.7 million in payments from foreign governments - equal to more than 7,400 nights at the hotel, raising a potential conflict of interest.
The hotel is in the city's second-tallest structure, after the Washington Monument. The building previously housed the U.S. Post Office Department Headquarters.

""We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,"" Sanders wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Taking a jibe at the 80-year-old senator, Musk responded by saying ""I keep forgetting that you're still alive.""

DUBAI (Reuters) -Veteran budget-airlines investor Bill Franke handed Europe's Airbus a multi-billion-dollar order for 255 single-aisle A321neo passenger jets on Sunday, betting on a quick snapback in tourist travel after the pandemic.
Watched by the pioneer of basic fares and optional charges, Airbus signed deals with Wizz Air, Frontier Airlines, JetSMART and Volaris at the Dubai Airshow following joint negotiations coordinated by Franke's private equity firm Indigo Partners.
Airbus declined to give a value for the order after scrapping list prices in 2019. Based on the last published prices, the deal would be worth some $32 billion but market experts say discounts for such deals can reach well over 50%.
""It is our view that the market will go through a recovery and there will be a return to travel,"" Franke told Reuters.
The order includes 102 planes for Europe's Wizz Air and 91 for the U.S.-based Frontier Airlines, as well as 39 and 23 for Volaris and JetSMART respectively.
Franke's move on day one of the Dubai Airshow marks an injection of confidence after a steep downturn caused by COVID-19, delegates said, focusing on ""ultra-low-cost"" carriers that are expected to emerge with stronger finances than rivals.
The soft-spoken financier used the combined purchasing power of four airlines in which his firm has stakes to negotiate the best deal from Airbus - just as he had done with a 430-plane blockbuster order for the same carriers at Dubai in 2017.
Indigo Partners handled broad negotiations with Airbus, while carriers discussed detailed points, Franke told Reuters.
""I am kind of the price delivery guy,"" he said.
The new deal includes 27 of Airbus' largest single-aisle jet, the A321XLR, for Wizz Air, which plans to base them at UK and Abu Dhabi bases, Wizz's Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi said.
Planes from the overall order will be delivered mainly in the second half of the decade, Airbus said.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the order would contribute to Airbus' production goals. It plans to increase output to 64 such jets a month in 2023 from around 40 now but has run into opposition from suppliers and leasing firms over tentative proposals to raise this to as high as 75.
Heads of the four airlines in Dubai and connected by video said the new aircraft would help them meet environmental goals by reducing emissions per passenger, compared to smaller and older planes. Some environmental groups have criticised low-cost carriers over outright emissions, due to the number of flights.

Varadi, who once joked that he disliked attending air shows because he ended up spending money on new airplanes, confirmed the scope for striking deals under an announcement deadline. 
""I don't get overly excited by air shows,"" he told Reuters. ""But it seems to be a pretty good platform for announcements and pushing transactions through.""

By Siddharth Cavale and Corina Pons
(Reuters) - Major clothing and shoe companies are moving production to countries closer to their U.S. and European stores, smarting from a resurgence in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Vietnam and China that slowed or shut down production for several weeks earlier this year. 
The disclosures come amid a massive shipping logjam that is driving up costs and forcing companies to rethink their globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs in Asia.. 
The latest example is Spanish fashion retailer Mango, which told Reuters on Friday it has ""accelerated"" its process of increasing local production in countries such as Turkey, Morocco and Portugal. In 2019, the company largely sourced its products from China and Vietnam. Mango told Reuters that it would ""considerably"" expand the number of units manufactured locally in Europe in 2022. 
Similarly, U.S. shoe retailer Steve Madden on Wednesday said it had pulled back production in Vietnam and had shifted 50% of its footwear production to Brazil and Mexico from China, while Rubber clogs maker  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) said last month it was moving production to countries including Indonesia and Bosnia. 
Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, Morocco and Turkey were some of the countries drawing new interest from clothing and shoe producers, though China continues to produce a large share of the apparel for U.S. and European clothing chains. 
""We are seeing a lot of growth in freight and trucking activity in the former Soviet Republics ... a big rise in Hungary and Romania,"" said Barry Conlon, chief executive of Overhaul, a supply chain risk management firm. 
In Turkey, apparel exports are expected to reach $20 billion this year, an all-time high, driven by a spike in orders from the European Union, Turkey’s Union of Chambers Clothing and Garment Council data showed. In 2020, exports totaled $17 billion. 
In Bosnia & Herzegovina, exports of textiles, leather and footwear amounted to 739.56 million marka ($436.65 million) in the first half of 2021, higher than the same period in 2020. 
""Many companies from the European Union, which is our most important trading partner, are looking for new suppliers and new supply chains in the Balkan market,"" said Professor Muris Pozderac, secretary of the association of textile, clothing, leather and footwear in Bosnia & Herzegovina.
In Guatemala, where Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) significantly shifted its private-label volume production in 2020, clothing exports were a touch over $1 billion as of the end of August this year, up 34.2% from 2020 and even 8.8% higher than in 2019. 
To be sure, many companies are also still heavily reliant on Vietnam, where recent production stoppages have caused significant disruptions. Vietnam’s government said in October that it will fall short of its garment exports target this year, by $5 billion in a worst-case scenario, due to the impacts of coronavirus restrictions and a shortage of workers. 
Factory inspections in Vietnam - a proxy for retailer manufacturing orders - fell 40% in the third quarter versus the second quarter, with production during those months quickly moving to Bangladesh, India and Cambodia. Inspection rates in Vietnam were still hovering at lower levels in the fourth quarter, with a small uptick seen in late October, said Mathieu Labasse, vice president of QIMA, a supply-chain quality control and auditing firm that represents more than 15,000 brands. 
Apparel maker VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) and outdoor gear maker  Columbia Sportswear  (NASDAQ:COLM) were among companies that warned that there would be delays in fall and spring collections and in some cases insufficient size assortments. 

Michael Kors handbags maker Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) said on Wednesday that it would not have the inventories it wanted for the holiday season, while athletic gear maker Under Armour (NYSE:UA) said on last Tuesday it was canceling purchase orders from Vietnam just to help get ""the factories get back up and caught up.""

Britain's Digital and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries is expected to instruct the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to undertake a ""phase two"" probe of the deal next week, the report said.
The U.S. company agreed to buy ARM from Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) in September 2020, triggering a backlash from politicians, rivals and customers.
ARM's technology is used by competing chipmakers, such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to produce their own processors.
Chipmakers worry that ARM will not retain its neutral player status under Nvidia's ownership. 
Nvidia has said the fears are unfounded.
Nonetheless, Britain's CMA sounded an alarm over the deal in August, when it said the merged entity could reduce competition in markets around the world that rely on chip technology.
The government has been considering the CMA's findings, as well as assessing the possible national security implications of the deal.
A full in-depth inquiry would take around six months, after which the government could block the takeover, approve it or allow it to pass with certain undertakings.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on the Sunday Times report.

Philips in September estimated it will replace up to 4 million vetilators and respiratory devices because of a polyurethane foam part that might degrade and become toxic.
The company has produced 15 million devices using the foam since 2009 but some are not in use.
On Nov. 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said that it had obtained new information during inspections of the company's Murraysville, PA facility.
The FDA asked Philips to conduct more tests on the foam used in the recalled ventilators and said the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that other devices containing the foam should not also be recalled. It also said Philips' procedures for design change may not be adequate.
“We will work closely with the FDA to clarify and follow up on the inspectional findings and its recent requests related to comprehensive testing,"" Philips CEO Frans van Houten said in a statement.
""Until we have concluded these discussions, we are not able to publicly provide further details.""
It said it expected to complete its own testing of the foam in the fourth quarter.
The company has been using a replacement silicone-based foam which must now also undergo further safety testing. 
The FDA statement said that while it could not be sure, on the basis of what it knows now, that the silicone-based foam being used for repaired products is safe either, it does not recommend patients stop using them, based on a risk-benefit assessment.
Philips has so far put aside 500 million euros ($572.50 million in provisions for recall costs. In October it lowered financial forecasts for the year, citing fallout from the recall and related lawsuits.

A 160-page stock exchange filing on Sunday showed the directors reviewed records related to the 2019 deal between a group unit, Future Coupons, and Amazon, and argued that disclosures by the U.S. company before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) when it sought approval of the deal contradicted Amazon's own internal communications at the time.
Amazon and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment on the disclosure on Sunday.
The two companies' legal dispute, centred around Amazon's deal to invest $200 million in Future Coupons, has become a high-stakes battle which could determine the dominant player in India's retail market in the years ahead.
Amazon has successfully used the tie-up to block Future's attempted sale of retail assets to rival Reliance for $3.4 billion, which the Indian company is banking on to help keep its business afloat.
According to the Sunday filing, Future's directors told the CCI in a Nov. 10 letter that Amazon's intentions were not to invest in Future Coupons because of its ""unique business model and strong growth potential"", as it stated while seeking approvals.
Rather, an internal email from an Amazon India executive to other senior Amazon executives, entitled ""Future Retail Limited Investment"", said the U.S. firm was using a ""'twin-entity investment' structure to invest in Future Retail"" due to Indian law restrictions. 
""The CCI has to revoke the approval granted for Amazon's investment,"" the letter from Future's independent directors stated.
Their filing is the latest salvo in an escalating legal battle.
In July, Reuters exclusively reported that the CCI had reviewed a complaint from Future and then accused Amazon of concealing facts while seeking the 2019 deal approval, after the watchdog compared legal disclosures made by Amazon at several forums.

The company told Reuters at the time that it was confident of addressing the watchdog's concerns.
India's financial crime-fighting agency has also ordered Future - the country's second-largest retailer - to submit documents related to the 2019 Amazon deal as part of an investigation into possible breach of foreign investment laws, Reuters reported last week.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The nuts and bolts of post-pandemic trade loomed over the first major aerospace event since the coronavirus crisis on Sunday, as planemakers touted new freighters plans at the Dubai Airshow.    
Plane giants Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are hoping to launch the West's first all-new flying juggernauts in 25 years as e-commerce gets a boost from the global pandemic.    
Airbus, without a buyer after launching a freighter version of its A350 jet in the summer, was knocking on the door of one the industry's go-to patrons for new plane launches, Steven Udvar-Hazy's Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp, industry sources said.    
And for best-selling small passenger planes, the founder of Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air was also seen ready to hand Airbus an order in Dubai, four years after taking part in a group of airlines striking a record deal at the same event.
Reuters reported in September that Wizz was in negotiations with Airbus over the purchase of at least 100 more jets.
Air Lease is expected to be among early customers for a long-haul A350 freighter alongside an unspecified cargo firm, industry publication The Air Current reported.    
Airbus declined comment at the opening of the Dubai Airshow on Sunday, the first day of the Middle East industry event. Wizz and Air Lease were not immediately available for comment.    
An A350 freighter would go up against a proposed cargo version of Boeing's 777X passenger series, a twin-engined successor to the soon-to-be-halted 747.
Boeing has not launched the cargo variant but analysts say it is widely expected to do soon as it negotiates with potential buyers including major cargo player Qatar Airways.     
Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, who is locked in a dispute with Airbus over the quality of A350 passenger planes, said in June Qatar was in discussions over a possible 777X freighter.    
Freighters have replaced jumbo passenger jets in typical dealmaking at the showcase event, as the industry looks to put on a brave face after losing two years of passenger growth to the global drop in travel caused by COVID-19.
In contrast to the passenger market, air freight is booming as consumers increasingly shop online while global supply chain constraints have limited the amount of cargo that can be moved.
MILITARY DELEGATIONS 
Converted passenger jets are also riding the freight boom. Reykjavik-headquartered lessor Icelease announced an order for 11 Boeing 737-800 converted freighters on Sunday.    
Chief Operating Officer Magnus Stephensen said demand for freighters would continue to expand even as passenger jets grounded by the pandemic return to the skies, putting currently unused capacity in their cargo holds back into the market.
""The COVID pandemic has changed the cargo environment for good,"" he said. ""E-commerce has entirely changed the outlook.""    
Military officials also gathered as diplomats say Gulf states and neighbours are questioning Washington's commitment to the region following a pull-out from Afghanistan.    
Washington is the key security partner for the six Gulf Arab countries that include Saudi Arabia and the UAE, though European states have sought to increase their influence.    
U.S. Lieutenant General Gregory Guillot, the top American air force general in the Middle East, said on Saturday the U.S. was committed to the region but that ""size and presence could adjust"" at times depending on what was happening elsewhere.     
Israel has a public presence at the show for the first time after establishing diplomatic ties with the UAE last year.    

Russia is due to present its Sukhoi Su-75 ""Checkmate"" fighter, a competitor to the U.S. F-35 that the UAE is buying as part of a deal with Washington following the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel.
The Emirati deal has slowed as U.S. senators seek more control of arms deals, including assurances that weapons sales to Middle East countries won't undermine Israeli security.

The jointly owned Airbus and Leonardo subsidiary is marking its 40th aniversary at the Dubai Airshow, which opened on Sunday as the aerospace industry tries to secure momentum for a fragile recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.
Industry sources said ATR would announce a new variant of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 engines that power its 42-600 and 72-600 family of turboprop planes.
ATR dominates the market for turboprops, which it values at some $80 billion over 20 years. The planes are seen as more efficient on short trips, especially when oil prices are high. 
But ATR faces potential challengers including Brazil's Embraer, which is weighing plans to launch an all-new and bigger turboprop as early as next year. Other projects are taking shape in China and Germany.
The upgraded PW127 engine would reduce costs by staying in use longer between repair visits and reducing maintenance costs, while offering incremental savings in fuel and emissions, the sources said, asking not to be identified.
ATR and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), both declined to comment.

ATR Chief Executive Stefano Bortoli pledged in September to announce product improvements soon.
""There will be competition in the future...We have ideas on how to maintain our leadership. We are not resting on our laurels,"" he told reporters in Toulouse, where ATR is based.

Malaysian factories making everything from medical gloves to palm oil have increasingly come under scrutiny over allegations they abuse foreign workers, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.
After the United States suspended Supermax imports last month, Canada's Public Services and Procurement department said on Wednesday it was holding Supermax deliveries as it awaits a report expected mid-month from Supermax Healthcare Canada.
""In light of the current situation, Canada has engaged with the company to seek assurances that Supermax Corp is not engaging in forced labour practices,"" the department said in a statement. 
Supermax did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a ""Withhold Release Order"" on Oct 21 that prohibits imports from Supermax based on reasonable information that indicates the use of forced labour in its manufacturing operations.
Supermax has said it was in contact with the U.S. agency to obtain more clarity and that it had commissioned an independent consulting firm to conduct an audit into the status of foreign workers at its factories.
Canada said it will determine its next steps after reviewing the report from Supermax's Canadian unit.
""The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that it does not do business with companies that employ unethical practices, either directly or within their supply chains,"" it added.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2021 03:01AM ET</span>",Jetmakers push freighters as industry gathers in Dubai,"By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) -Boeing said on Saturday it was in advanced talks to sell a cargo version of its future 777X jetliner jet while Airbus predicted an A350 freighter deal soon, as aerospace giants eye a post-pandemic boom in e-commerce.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) also indicated it was nearing the end of production snags on the 787 Dreamliner, but reiterated the timing of any return to normal deliveries depended on talks with regulators.
""We are in pretty advanced discussions with a number of customers. The (777X freighter) looks good from a design standpoint and a requirements standpoint,"" Ihssane Mounir, senior vice president of commercial sales and marketing, said.
The U.S. planemaker is poised to launch what it says would be the world's largest and most capable new freighter, while European rival Airbus is seeking buyers for an A350 cargo version that it describes as lighter and more efficient.
Airbus expects to announce a launch order for the A350 freighter ""soon,"" Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told a separate news conference on the eve of the Dubai Airshow, the first significant industry gathering since the pandemic.
""I am quite happy with the market response around the world and in the region to the A350 freighter,"" he added.
The 777X freighter is expected to be based on the smaller of two versions of the 777X family, known as the 777-8.
It had been expected to be launched only after the 777-8 passenger version, but Mounir said it could jump ahead of the 777-8, whose sales have lagged the main 777-9 variant.
Boeing is sticking to plans to deliver the 777-9 in 2023, Mounir said. The president of Dubai's Emirates, the biggest customer for the 777X, has sharply criticised Boeing for around three years of delays and a lack of certainty on delivery dates.
REGULATORS' CALL
Qatar Airways has said publicly it is in talks with Boeing over the possible purchase of a 777X freighter, while FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is widely seen as another early contender. Airbus hopes to land an A350 cargo deal with Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY).
Freighter traffic has increased as passenger jets that usually carry goods in the hold were grounded by the pandemic.
Mounir and Scherer, sales chiefs for the world's two largest planemakers, both said a market recovery was under way, though doubts remain over demand for the largest wide-body jetliners.
Boeing is meanwhile approaching the resumption of deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, after suspending them to deal with production flaws, and engaging with Chinese regulators over the re-certification of the 737 MAX in China, Mounir said.
But he stressed that Boeing would not pre-empt U.S. or Chinese regulators, who make final decisions on timing.
The 787 has been beset by production problems that have halted deliveries since May. In July, the Federal Aviation Administration said some 787s had a manufacturing quality issue.
Analysts say Boeing continues to tread a fine line between completing work it says it has itself identified on the 787, a vital alternative source of cash to the still recovering 737 MAX, and leaving the last word on timing to regulators.
Boeing said last month it had a ""clear line of sight"" to resuming deliveries but that the Federal Aviation Administration would make the ultimate decision.
""We remain committed to taking the time to ensure each airplane meets our rigorous engineering specifications. We are conducting inspections and rework and engaging in detailed, transparent discussions with our regulators, customers and suppliers,"" Mounir told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""While we never want to disappoint or cause delays for our customers, quality and safety always come first.""
The 737 MAX was cleared by major Western regulators late last year after an almost two-year safety grounding, but China has yet to allow it back to service.

China's aviation regulator has told airlines it is satisfied that design changes Boeing proposed for its 737 MAX plane could resolve safety problems, in a sign it is closer to lifting a more than two-year flight ban..
Mounir told reporters Boeing would comply with requirements from U.S. or international regulators.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's 2030 emissions target is fixed, and the government is committed to beating it, several ministers said on Sunday, without saying whether targets would be updated as the recently concluded UN climate summit in Glasgow demanded.
The Glasgow talks ended Saturday with a deal that for the first-time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, calling for tougher emissions pledges by 2022, among other things. 
""Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it,"" Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Energy Minister Angus Taylor said in a joint statement after the summit ended, adding the government will do ""what's right for rural and regional communities.""
Australia's current commitment calls for a 26% to 28% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030.
The country, one of world's top producers of coal and gas, was named the ""colossal fossil"" of the UN talks by Climate Action Network activists for ""its appalling approach to climate change policy"".
Prime Minister Scott Morrison adopted a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but said he would not legislate the goal. He rejected a global pledge, led by the European Union and the United States, to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030.
Greg Hunt, Australia's health minister who was the environment minister in 2013-2016, refused to say on Sunday whether the government will update the target. 

""We've set our target. But what we'll continue to do is update our projections,"" Hunt said in an interview on the Australian Broadcast Corp's Insiders programme.
When pressed further, Hunt paraphrased William Shakespeare from his play, ""Henry IV"", saying, ""I never promised to pay thee, but now that I'm here, I'll pay thee double'. It means under-promise and over-deliver.""

Musk was responding to a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) commenter who said Musk would end up with more Tesla shares if he sold options instead of shares. 
""A careful observer would note that my (low basis) share sale rate significantly exceeds my 10b (high basis) option exercise rate, thus closer to tax maximization than minimization,"" the world's richest person and Tesla's top shareholder said in a tweet.
Musk had previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options this year, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could potentially free up funds to pay the taxes.
A week ago, Musk tweeted that he would sell 10% of his shares if users of the social media platform endorsed the move.

""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he said in a tweet https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088. A majority of people who responded to the poll expressed support for the sale.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>","Airbus shaves 20-year demand forecast, sees faster replacements","By Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) -Airbus shaved its forecast for total commercial airplane demand by 0.5% compared with pre-pandemic projections on Saturday, offset by a brighter outlook for freighters as jetmakers fight for inaugural sales of new cargo planes.
Airbus updated the widely watched forecast on the eve of the Dubai Airshow, where a battered aviation industry is reeling from the loss of two years' growth to COVID-19, while outlining its latest environmental plans amid growing climate pressure.
Airbus said it expected a market total of 39,020 jetliner deliveries in the next 20 years, fractionally lower than the 39,213 it predicted two years ago in its last rolling forecast. 
The estimate for small planes like the best-selling A320 was essentially flat at 29,690 units, but the outlook for long-haul jets that traditionally dominate the region fell 3.1%.
The view echoes that of Boeing (NYSE:BA) which in September cut its 20-year delivery forecast by 1% compared to 2019. That tempered greater pessimism seen from Boeing as the crisis peaked in 2020.
Airbus issued slightly weaker forecasts for medium jets - a key battleground that includes its longest-range narrrow-body jet, the A321XLR. Its sales have been causing a headache for Boeing at the top end of its recently troubled 737 MAX range.
After two years of COVID-related travel restrictions, Airbus slashed its forecast for average annual growth in passenger traffic over 20 years to 3.9% from 4.3% in pre-pandemic 2019. 
Traffic and airline profits set the pace for plane orders.
""We have lost effectively two years of traffic growth because of the pandemic,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said.
However, Airbus raised its 20-year delivery forecast for freighters by 2.9% to 880 units and predicted an order soon for a new A350 freighter. Boeing said it is in advanced discussions with potential buyers for its new 777X freighter.
Airbus said a rising share of total airplane deliveries would be to replace jets already in the market rather than to facilitate the recently curbed growth plans of many airlines.
That emphasis reflects expectations that airlines will retire less efficient jets earlier following COVID-19, but also addresses a sensitive point for the industry as some environmental groups target what they see as over-expansion.
Airbus said 39% of deliveries would replace older planes with higher emissions, compared with 36% in an earlier forecast.

Faster retirements worry some suppliers and lessors who fear the economically useful life of jets will fall, forcing them to miss out on service revenues or push up depreciation costs.
Scherer dismissed suppliers' criticism of Airbus' plans to raise output in coming years, saying this would not flood the market but would instead modernise fleets and curb emissions.

Thousands of employees at Kaiser Permanente in Oregon, California, Colorado and other states had threatened to walkout on Monday over the medical network's plan to create a two-tiered wage system with lower pay for new hires.
Kaiser and Alliance of Health Care Unions, which represents 22 local unions, agreed on a four-year contract that includes wage increases each year through 2025, the union said in a statement. The deal also includes health and retirement benefits and the introduction of a bonus plan. The statement did not include any financial details.
""This agreement will mean patients will continue to receive the best care, and Alliance members will have the best jobs,"" Hal Ruddick, executive director of the Alliance union, said in the statement. ""This contract protects our patients, provides safe staffing, and guarantees fair wages and benefits for every Alliance member,"" he added.
Earlier, the union said the two-tiered wage system would deepen what the nurses describe as a staffing crisis in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic.
Kaiser ranks as one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare networks and managed-care organizations, with operating revenues of nearly $24 billion last quarter.

""This landmark agreement positions Kaiser Permanente for a successful future focused on providing high-quality health care that is affordable and accessible for our more than 12 million members and the communities we serve,"" said Christian Meisner, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Kaiser Permanente. 
Voting on the tentative agreement will occur over the next several weeks and once it is ratified, the agreement will be retroactive to Oct. 1, 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. states led by Texas have filed an amended complaint against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google accusing the tech giant of using coercive tactics and breaking antitrust laws in its efforts to boost its already dominant advertising business.
The updated allegations are the latest in an onslaught of regulatory scrutiny of Google over its practices. The tech company faces several lawsuits, including one by the Justice Department for monopolistic practices. 
Earlier this week, Google lost an appeal against a $2.8 billion European Union antitrust decision.
The amended U.S. lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York late Friday, accuses Google of using monopolistic and coercive tactics with advertisers in its efforts to dominate and drive out competition in online advertising. 

The lawsuit also highlights Google's use of a secret program dubbed ""Project Bernanke"" in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers' auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company's Google Ads. They otherwise would have likely lost the auctions, the states alleged.
Neither Alphabet nor the Texas Attorney General's office responded immediately to requests for comment on the lawsuit.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Belarus had not consulted him before raising the possibility of cutting Russian natural gas flows to Europe, adding that such a move would risk harming ties between Minsk and its key ally Moscow.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened on Thursday to retaliate against any new European Union sanctions against Minsk over a migrant standoff on the Belarus-EU border, suggesting he could halt the transit of gas and other goods via Belarus.
His warning briefly lifted spot gas prices in Europe, which gets about a third of its supplies of the fuel from Russia, including via the Yamal-Europe pipeline that runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany. 
The Belarusian section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline is owned by Russia's state gas monopoly, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
""I've recently spoken to (Lukashenko) twice and he didn't mention this to me once, he didn't even hint,"" Putin said in a state television interview, making his first public comments about the Belarusian threat. 
""Of course, in theory, Lukashenko as president of a transit country could order our (gas) supplies to be cut to Europe. But this would mean a breach of our gas transit contract and I hope this will not happen,"" Putin added.
Russia has been Belarus's closest ally for years, helping with everything from cash to cheap energy supplies and military assistance, but Lukashenko's comments come at a sensitive time for Russia's energy exports to Europe.
Analysts say Lukashenko's gas comments have likely tested Putin's patience https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lukashenko-ties-fate-moscow-while-testing-putins-patience-2021-11-12 with Russian gas supplies already at the centre of heated debate in Europe. 
European gas prices - and therefore, energy bills - are on the rise this year as the recovery from the pandemic has triggered a spike in demand, forcing customers from Europe to Asia to fight for supplies. 
Some European politicians have accused Moscow of failing to do more than just send contractual gas volumes, in order to calm down prices.
The European Commission said on Friday that if Lukashenko made good on his threats, it would further harm gas suppliers. 
During Saturday's interview, Putin said that if Belarus did cut off supplies, it would ""cause great damage"" to the European energy sector ""and would not help in developing our relations with Belarus as a transit country"".
""I will raise this with him (Lukashenko) in case this wasn't something (he) said in the heat of the moment,"" Putin said. 
Russia, which this week started to increase supplies to refill its European storage ahead of the winter heating season, has said more could come once its newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline gets a green light from Germany. 

Nord Stream 2 is another Russian pipeline designed to bypass transit countries, particularly Ukraine, which has a history of gas pricing standoffs with Moscow. 
The Kremlin calls the pipeline a ""purely commercial project"" and denies that politics are behind it in any way.

The companies, which in addition to Toyota include Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp, Yamaha Motor and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, made the announcement at a race track in Okayama, western Japan, where Toyota is racing a hydrogen car.
The hydrogen race car is being driven by Toyota chief eexcutive Akio Toyoda along with other Toyota drivers.
Converting internal combustion engines to green fuels such as hydrogen is technologically difficult, but doing so would allow the companies to support decades-old existing supply chains employing hundreds of thousands of workers that they may otherwise have to drop as they switch to building electric vehicles (EV).

As nations tighten environmental regulations to cut carbon emissions, automakers including Toyota, are ramping up production of EVs. Japan has said it aims to be carbon neutral by 2050 and is promoting the use of hydrogen fuel.
Toyota plans for 15 EV models by 2025 and is investing $13.5 billion over the next decade to expand battery production capacity. At the same, time however, it is continuing to develop vehicles powered by hydrogen.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 11:06PM ET</span>",Some states expand booster availability beyond federal recommendations,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Hard hit by rising cases and hospitalizations, officials in Colorado and California this week have directed healthcare providers to make COVID-19 vaccine boosters available to all adults, overriding more restrictive guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""I think it is kind of remarkable,"" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University in Washington and a former chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Goodman said he believes the new policies may be driven by two factors: ""the desire to do anything possible to reduce infections"" and to simplify the national guidelines for delivering booster doses that states consider to be too complex.
In California, the state's health department instructed providers to allow people to determine themselves whether they were at high risk in a letter dated Nov. 9, and instructed them not to turn away adults requesting boosters. 
In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis on Thursday issued an executive order declaring the state at high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, making every resident 18 or older eligible for a booster shot.
Requests for comment from California's health department and the governor's office in Colorado were not immediately returned.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in August announced plans to roll out booster doses for all adults inSeptember, before advisers from the FDA and CDC had recommended a more limited authorization. 
Final recommendations were more restrictive, allowing boosters for individuals in several different categories. They are recommended for all fully immunized adults 65 and older who received any of the three vaccines. For younger adults, boosters are only recommended for those with underlying health conditions or those whose jobs or living situations put them at increased risk of COVID-19.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech on Tuesday filed for FDA approval for expanded use of its booster for all adults, but the FDA has yet to weigh in.
Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, said he does not expect the agency's vaccine advisers to hear Pfizer's request for expanded use of its booster shots to all adults.

""It would be great if it did,"" he said, because the public would likely see some of the same hesitation the advisory panel expressed during the initial review of Pfizer's request for authorization of boosters for all adults.
Offit said he is still not convinced there is a benefit for boosters for those aged 18 to 29, especially in young men, where there a potential risk of a heart inflammation side effect known as myocarditis. ""It's rare, but it's real,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Friday tossed out greenhouse gas emissions rules for heavy-duty truck trailers, ruling two government agencies had exceeded their authority.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2016 set rules for the first time requiring trailer manufacturers to adopt fuel-saving technologies like side skirts and automatic tire pressure systems. An industry group challenged the rule, which was put on hold by the court pending the review.
The administration of then-President Barack Obama said it was important to regulate the fuel efficiency of the trailer portion of commercial tractor-trailers ""because large tractor-trailers account for 60% of the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles.""
The court ruled that if it allowed the trailer regulations, then ""NHTSA could regulate bike racks, rooftop cargo carriers, or anything similar that would impact the fuel efficiency of a vehicle."" The court added: ""NHTSA can regulate tractors based on the trailers they pull, as can the EPA. But neither NHTSA nor the EPA can regulate trailers themselves.""
The EPA said in 2016 as much as one-third of potential reductions in tractor-trailer emissions could be achieved through regulation of the trailer’s equipment and design alone.
The EPA and NHTSA did not immediately comment.

The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA), which had sued to block the rules, said it was still reading the ruling and did not immediately comment. The group had argued that the rules were improper because trailers do not consume fuel, as they are not self-propelled.
TTMA said earlier its members, which manufacture 90% of U.S. truck trailers, would incur ""unrecoverable compliance costs,"" including from reconfiguring assembly lines.

(Reuters) - The Duke Ellington School of the Arts, in Northwest D.C., said it will postpone renaming its theater after Dave Chappelle, one of its best known graduates, to engage with members of the school who raised concerns about the comedian's latest Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) comedy special.
The event, originally scheduled for November 23, has now been moved to April 22, the educational institution said in a statement on Friday.
Chappelle's latest Netflix comedy special, ""The Closer,"" was criticized by some who saw it as a ridicule of transgender people. Supporters of the comedian https://www.reuters.com/world/us/comedian-dave-chappelle-addresses-netflix-transgender-controversy-full-first-2021-10-25 viewed it as a cry against cancel culture. 
Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had acknowledged Chappelle's provocative language in ""The Closer"" but said earlier that it did not cross the line into inciting violence.
""Dave is an artist and activist and applauds the school taking time to develop creative and critical thinkers,"" Carla Sims, a representative for Chappelle, told the Washington Post on Friday. ""He supports the school and any effort to contribute to open conversations vs. cancellations.""
In its statement, the Duke Ellington School of the Arts described Chappelle as its ""most distinguished alumni"" and ""an important thought leader"", adding the comedian has personally donated or raised millions of dollars to address the school's under-funding.
""The Closer - the most watched comedy special in Netflix's history, which has garnered a 96% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes - has sparked a national debate around race, gender, sexuality and 'cancel culture'"", the school said.
""We also believe moving forward with the event, originally scheduled for November 23, 2021, without first addressing questions and concerns from members of the Ellington community, would be a missed opportunity for a teachable moment,"" it added.

The institution said it recognized not everyone will accept or welcome an artist's point of view, but added it rejected the notion that a ""cancel culture"" is healthy or constructive.
Last month, dozens of people protested near the streaming company's headquarters over Chappelle's latest Netflix special.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 10:05PM ET</span>",Musk sells nearly $7 billion worth of Tesla shares this week,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) -Tesla CEO Elon Musk offloaded a combined $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric car company this week, taking advantage of a meteoric rally that vaulted the firm's value to over $1 trillion.
The billionaire sold 1.2 million shares held by his trust for more than $1.2 billion on Friday, the latest in a flurry of his stock transactions, according to a U.S. securities filing released later in the day.
The world's richest person and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s top shareholder last Saturday tweeted that he would sell 10% https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-asks-followers-twitter-whether-he-should-sell-10-his-tesla-stock-2021-11-06 of his shares if users of the social media platform approved the move. The 10% would be about 17 million shares at the time of his tweet. 
He has sold 6.36 million shares this week - around 37% of 17 million. He now needs to offload about 10 million more shares to fulfill his pledge to sell 10% of his holdings.
Shares of Tesla Inc closed lower on Friday, down 2.8% at $1,033.42, snapping an 11-week winning streak. The shares are up more than 46% this year following a sharp rally in October. 
The stock sales, which marked the first time that Musk cashed out on a stake of that size since the company was founded in 2003, were massive by capital market standards, eclipsing the initial public offerings of most companies.
By getting Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users to green-light the move, he has blunted potential criticism of cashing out at a time when Tesla's valuation has become frothy and shares are at record highs.
STILL MOST VALUABLE U.S. AUTOMAKER
Tesla shares fell 15.4% this week and lost some $187 billion in market value, more than the combined market capitalizations of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Despite the week's losses, Tesla is still the most valuable automaker in the world. Recent strong gains in the stock have underscored demand for shares of electric vehicle (EV) makers.
After the blockbuster market debut https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-rivian-set-high-profile-market-debut-after-mammoth-ipo-2021-11-10 of Rivian Automotive Inc on Wednesday, the two most valuable U.S. automakers are EV companies.
In a veiled jab at the Irvine, California-based rival, Musk tweeted https:// on Thursday: ""There have been hundreds of automotive startups, both electric & combustion, but Tesla is (the) only American carmaker to reach high volume production & positive cash flow in past 100 years."" 
MORE SALES?
Musk had previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options this year, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.

Prior to the sale, Musk owned a stake of about 23% in Tesla, including stock options. After his exercise on 2.15 million stocks on Monday, he has options for 20 million more shares he needs to exercise by next August.
""We expect the share sales will continue, as Musk holds millions of options worth billions of dollars that would otherwise expire worthless, and he has also prearranged share sales under 10b5-1 plans,"" said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group LLC in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it is looking into a consumer report that a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y was involved in an accident while using the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software.
The owner of a 2021 Tesla Model Y reported to the auto safety agency that on Nov. 3 in Brea, California the vehicle was in FSD Beta mode ""and while taking a left turn the car went into the wrong lane and I was hit by another driver in the lane next to my lane.""
The car ""gave an alert half way through the turn"" and the driver tried to assume control ""but the car by itself took control and forced itself into the incorrect lane,"" the report says. The car was severely damaged on the driver side, the owner added.
""NHTSA is aware of the consumer complaint in question and is in communication with the manufacturer to gather additional information,"" an NHTSA spokesperson told Reuters on Friday.
Tesla did not immediately comment. 
Earlier this month, Tesla recalled https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalling-nearly-12000-us-vehicles-over-software-communication-error-2021-11-02 nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles because of a communication error that could trigger a false collision warning or unexpected automatic emergency brake.
The recall was prompted after a software update to vehicles with FSD Beta. Tesla said more than 99.8% of the vehicles recalled as of Oct. 29 had installed a software update to address the issue and no further action was necessary. 
FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks but Tesla says does not make vehicles completely autonomous. The features ""require a fully attentive driver,"" it says.

Last month, NHTSA raised concerns about how FSD was being used. ""Despite Tesla's characterization of FSD as 'beta,' it is capable of and is being used on public roads,"" NHTSA said.
NHTSA in August opened https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-opens-formal-safety-probe-into-tesla-autopilot-crashes-2021-08-16 a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot, a different driver assistance software system, after a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A group of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers in New York City's Staten Island have withdrawn a petition to hold a union election, marking a setback in a growing push by organized labor to bring the online retailer's staff into the fold.
The group, known as the Amazon Labor Union, which is not affiliated with a major U.S. union, filed its petition last month, joining union campaigns underway at Amazon facilities in Alabama and Canada.
In order to hold an election supervised by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, unions must show that they have gathered signatures of support from at least 30% of workers who are eligible to vote.
Chris Smalls, president of the group and a former employee at the Staten Island warehouse, said Friday the group opted to withdraw its petition after the NLRB informed them they had not collected enough signatures.
""We will resubmit as soon as we can,"" Smalls said in an interview, adding that he was signing more cards with workers ""as we speak.""
Amazon handily beat back an effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to organize its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse earlier this year. But unions have continued to organize, with the RWDSU gearing up for a potential rematch https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-takes-another-swipe-union-alabama-rematch-looms-2021-11-04 in Alabama.
Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement that the company is focused on ""listening directly to our employees and continuously improving on their behalf.""
Amazon raised doubts last month about whether the Amazon Labor Union had gathered enough legitimate signatures to hold a union election.
Unions and companies often tangle over which employees should be eligible to vote in elections, with employers pushing for broader bargaining units to dilute support, labor experts say.
Smalls said he collected some 2,000 signatures to request an official vote through the NLRB, and has since submitted additional signatures.
Nantel told Reuters Amazon has more than 6,000 employees at the JFK8 fulfillment center and more than 9,600 across its Staten Island campus.
Unions typically try to gather signatures from 50% to 70% of workers to give themselves a cushion if some cards are challenged by employers, and to ensure they can withstand anti-union campaigns by companies before workers ultimately vote, labor experts say.

Amid a wave of labor activity at Amazon warehouses, the Staten Island campaign stands apart in that it is advancing outside the umbrella of a traditional labor union. Smalls rose to prominence last year when Amazon fired him, alleging he violated a paid pandemic-related quarantine when he showed up at his facility to protest work conditions. Smalls later filed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-lawsuit-idCAKBN27S34E a class-action suit against Amazon.
The news of Amazon Labor Union's withdrawal of its petition was previously reported by Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Business information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc and IHS Markit Ltd have won U.S. antitrust approval for their planned merger, on condition it sell some businesses and scrap a non-compete agreement with GasBuddy, the Justice Department said in a statement.
The $44 billion deal was initially announced in November 2020.
To win approval for the deal, the companies agreed to sell three of IHS Markit's price reporting agency (PRA) businesses. The department said the businesses are: Oil Price Information Services (OPIS); Coals, Metals, and Mining (CMM); and PetrochemWire (PCW).
The businesses will be bought by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) under a $1.15 billion deal reached in August.
In a court filing, the Justice Department said that S&P Global and IHS are a small number of companies that provide PRA services and ""compete vigorously in each of the relevant markets, resulting in lower prices and increased quality and innovation for PRA customers.""
One of them, OPIS, collects and sells information related to U.S. retail gasoline prices. GasBuddy has been one of OPIS' main sources of data since 2009. Since 2016, OPIS has had exclusive rights to GasBuddy's data for 20 years.
Because of the agreement, GasBuddy, which uses crowdsourced information to help people find deals on retail gasoline, has been stopped from creating a service to compete with OPIS, the department said.
""The divestitures will preserve competition for PRA (price reporting agency) services, which are vital to the proper functioning of commodity markets and promote transparency in the financial markets,"" Richard Powers, acting head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a statement.

GasBuddy parent company PDI praised the Justice Department settlement and said ""once the waiver clears, we look forward to providing petroleum marketers and wholesalers with a compelling pricing solution, through the 1 million retail fuel price submissions provided by GasBuddies on a daily basis.""
The deal won EU antitrust approval in October, with some of the same conditions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street stocks closed higher on Friday, with market-leading growth shares kick-starting indexes' climb as investors looked past disappointing U.S. economic data.
Despite their advances, all three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session below last Friday's close, ending a five-week streak of weekly gains.
Investors favored growth over value, with megacap tech stocks, led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), doing the heavy lifting.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment data for November unexpectedly dropped to a 10-year low, and a Labor Department report showed job openings barely budged from record highs even as workers are quitting in record numbers.
""Markets drifted higher today despite a very weak consumer sentiment report, as inflation seems to be hurting consumers more than corporate profits,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
The souring mood of the consumer could be worrisome to retailers as the holiday shopping season draws near, and is likely to draw intensified scrutiny to upcoming retail earnings reports.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) are among the high profile retailers expected to report next week.
""Investors will be focused on guidance from retailers to determine if inflation will crimp profit margins or if costs can be passed through,"" Carter added. 
Retail results will herald the last days of what was a largely upbeat third-quarter earnings season. As of Friday, 459 of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported. Of those, 80% delivered consensus-beating earnings, according to Refinitiv.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 179.08 points, or 0.5%, to 36,100.31. The S&P 500 gained 33.58 points, or 0.72%, at 4,682.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 156.68 points, or 1%, at 15,860.96.
Ten of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended higher, with communications services' 1.7% advance leading gainers. Energy's 0.3% dip represented the largest percentage loss.
Shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) gained 1.2% after the healthcare giant announced splitting into two companies, dividing its consumer health care segments from its pharmaceuticals/medical devices business.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc dropped 2.8% on news that Chief Executive Elon Musk has sold an additional $700 million in stock in the next chapter of a saga that began with Musk's infamous Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll on whether he should offload shares in the company he founded.
Rival electric automaker Rivian Automotive Inc advanced 5.7%, notching its third consecutive gain in as many days as a publicly traded company.
U.S.-listed shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding slipped 0.6% following the e-commerce giant's report showing its slowest-ever Singles Day sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 130 new highs and 96 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China has been pushing U.S. executives, companies and business groups in recent weeks to fight against China-related bills in the U.S. Congress, four sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters, in letters to and meetings with a wide range of actors in the business community. 
Letters from China's embassy in Washington have pressed executives to urge members of Congress to alter or drop specific bills that seek to enhance U.S. competitiveness, according to the sources and the text of a letter sent by the embassy's economic and commercial office seen by Reuters. 
Chinese officials warned companies they would risk losing market share or revenue in China if the legislation becomes law, according to the text of the letter.
The Chinese embassy and the head of its economic and commercial office did not return separate requests for comment. 
The sources said China's request also left some individuals who received a letter concerned that they could be seen as violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) if they lobbied lawmakers on similar issues in the future.
As a result, none of the sources wanted to be identified as having received or seen the letter.
Sweeping legislation to boost U.S. competition with China and fund much-needed semiconductor production, known as the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. A related bill in the House of Representatives called the Eagle Act, which is more strictly policy focused, has stalled as Congress has been preoccupied with other domestic initiatives.
The language in the letters, which Reuters determined were sent separately to a wide number of people, explicitly asks companies to oppose USICA and the Eagle Act.
Beijing sees the measures, which take a hard line toward China on human rights and trade issues, as part of a U.S. effort to counter the country's growing economic and geopolitical might.
""We sincerely hope you ... will play a positive role in urging members of Congress to abandon the zero-sum mindset and ideological prejudice, stop touting negative China-related bills, delete negative provisions, so as to create favorable conditions for bilateral economic and trade cooperation before it is too late,"" the Chinese embassy said in one letter sent in early November.
Reuters confirmed the shared language of the letter with the four sources.
""The result of those China-related bills with negative impacts will not be that the interests of U.S. companies will be protected while those of Chinese companies will suffer. It is only going to hurt everyone,"" it said.
""Promoting a China-free supply chain will inevitably result in a decline in China's demand for U.S. products and American companies loss of market share and revenue in China,"" it said.
Two of the sources said similar messages were conveyed in meetings with staff of China's embassy.

""It's an outright ask by a foreign government,"" one of the sources said, highlighting the implications for FARA, which requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign power or political party to disclose those relations to the Department of Justice.
A second source said the approach appeared geared at getting companies to delay the legislative process rather than block the bills entirely.

Therefore, we think fundamentally strong apparel retailers Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (UAA), Capri Holdings (CPRI), and Ralph Lauren (RL) could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.Most apparel companies established or strengthened their digital presence amid the COVID-19 pandemic to offset the decline in sales caused by lower foot traffic at their brick-and-mortar stores and outright store closures. With solid progress on the vaccination front and rising consumer spending, the industry has witnessed decent sales growth of late, despite rising inflation and supply chain disruptions. Introducing new fashion apparel to keep pace with the changing consumer trends should enable apparel companies to grow this holiday season.
The lifting of travel bans affecting various nations should further drive apparel companies’ sales ahead of the holiday season. The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts holiday retail sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% during November and December. Moreover, the global apparel market is expected to grow at 7.5% CAGR to $797.30 billion by 2025.

Read more to find out.Western Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:WES) acquires, owns, develops, and operates midstream assets primarily in the United States. The Woodlands, Tex.-based concern engages in gathering, compressing, treating, processing, and transporting natural gas. In comparison, Houston, Tex.-based Tellurian Inc.

European natural gas prices dipped Wednesday on signs that Russia may increase supplies. However, considering the severe supply and demand mismatch, prices are expected to remain high. In addition, Hurricane Ida, which knocked offline the vast majority of the Gulf of Mexico's oil and gas production, also contributed to the rise in natural gas prices. Furthermore, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said Brent crude oil, which drives the price of gasoline, could reach as much as $120 per barrel by the middle of next year. And according to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. households that rely on natural gas for heating will spend an average of $746 on heating their homes this winter, up 30% from last winter, which is the highest level since the winter of 2005-2006. So, both WES and TELL should benefit.
TELL’s shares have gained 10.3% in price over the past month, while WES has returned 1.1%. Also, TELL’s 78.3% gains over the past six months are significantly higher than WES’ 5.6% returns. Moreover, TELL is the clear winner with 202.3% gains versus WES’ 62% returns in terms of year-to-date performance.

""This is a necessary and long overdue step toward ensuring all Americans feel safe and confident while traveling and reduce the chances of yet another devastating winter surge,"" said the letter https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/holiday_vax_flight_letter_11.12.21.pdf from members of Congress led by Representatives Don Beyer and Ritchie Torres and Senator Dianne Feinstein.

The Biden administration also lifted travel restrictions that barred most foreign nationals from the United States who had recently been in China, Brazil, South Africa, Iran and much of Europe.
Asked why the administration was not imposing any requirements on domestic air travel, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday, ""Everything is on the table. We just don’t have any announcement to preview right now on this.""
The letter, signed by senior Democrats including Representatives Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff, David Cicilline, Barbara Lee and Eleanor Holmes Norton, praised the administration's adoption of international air vaccine requirements.

The modifications relate to certain confidential provisions of agreements that Bristol Meyers Squibb made to divest the psoriasis treatment drug, Otezla to rival Amgen. They will ensure that Amgen's Otezla will stay competitive in the market, the FTC said in a statement.
As a condition of Bristol Meyers Squibb's acquisition of Celgene, the FTC required the drugmaker to divest the drug to Amgen (O:AMGN), the FTC said.

The $13.4 billion divestiture settled FTC charges that Bristol Meyers Squibb's proposed $74 billion acquisition of Celgene would violate federal antitrust law, according to the FTC.
Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) bought Celgene for $80.3 billion in cash and stock in November 2019.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, with European shares hitting new highs on strong earnings, while the dollar eased but posted its biggest weekly gain since late August.
Gold rose to notch its best week in six months and extend a winning streak to seven sessions. The advance has been spurred by surging U.S. consumer prices that bolstered the metal's appeal as an inflation hedge and rattled bond investors.
The 6.2% year-over-year rise in inflation in October, the biggest jump since November 1990, upended the U.S. Treasury market as traders mulled whether the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. [US/]
Crude oil futures closed the week with a third consecutive weekly fall after sharp swings driven by the dollar's recent strengthening.
On Wall Street, mega-cap stocks  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB); Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc led stocks higher.
A case can be made that big tech stocks will react better to rising rates than cyclicals, said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.
""There's a feeling from the users and purchasers of tech that they can't be left behind, that they always need to be on the cutting edge,"" he said. ""That means they have more consistent and steadier growth regardless of the economic environment.""
MSCI's all-country world index closed up 0.64%, while the broad STOXX Europe 600 index rose 0.30% to a record closing high. France's CAC40 index and Germany's DAX index also ended at record closing highs.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.50%, the S&P 500 added 0.72% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.00%. 
Growth stocks rose 1.15%, outperforming a 0.20% gain in value stocks. ""This is a growthy market,"" Ghriskey said.
Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities, said inflation was a risk to watch, but it was still in the future.
""Stock prices will face a major crash only if the Federal Reserve turns out to be completely wrong in its assessment and is forced to raise interest rates rapidly. That's not where we are now,"" Fujito said. 
In Europe, euro zone money markets priced in two full European Central Bank rate hikes by the end of next year. A Reuters poll showed the Bank of England is expected to be the first major central bank to raise rates, probably next month.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk sold more shares of the electric carmaker, regulatory filings showed on Friday. Tesla shares fell 2.8%, the biggest decliner on the Nasdaq 100.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, slid 0.046% to 95.117.
The euro eased 0.08% to $1.1441, while the yen edged lower 0.14% to $113.8900. 
Too many hedge funds expected the Fed and other central banks to quickly turn hawkish as inflation rises and have been forced to cover their short positions in bonds, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC.
""Fund managers were the least overweight bonds that they've ever been in the history of the data going back over two decades,"" Hayes said. ""The volatility that you saw on and off in the last week or so was attributable to wrong-footedness in the bond market by a lot of hedge funds.""
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 2.0 basis points to 1.5784%.
German 10-year yields slid 0.7 basis point to -0.262%.
""Directionally, the line of least resistance is for lower bond prices and higher yields, and the stock market does not seem to care that much,"" said Mike Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 04:40PM ET</span>",J&J to spin off consumer products and focus on pharmaceuticals,"By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) plans to spin off its consumer health division that sells Listerine and Baby Powder to focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices in the biggest shake-up in the U.S. company's 135-year history.
The move by the world's largest health products company follows similar announcements by conglomerates Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), as well as J&J rivals, and underscores how big, diversified corporations are under pressure to simplify their structures to increase focus. 
This has particularly been the case in healthcare, where the slow-and-steady business of selling products such as shampoos and moisturizers has increasingly diverged from the high-risk, high-reward work of developing and marketing blockbuster drugs.
""We think these have evolved as fundamentally different businesses,"" J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said.
Rival public consumer companies tend to be valued more richly by investors than the J&J consumer unit, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk added in an interview.
""That, quite frankly, was getting lost within Johnson & Johnson,"" Wolk said. ""Similarly, I think - in terms of pharmaceuticals and medical devices - that prevented the spotlight from being shone on those businesses.""
The company said it was aiming to complete the separation in 18 to 24 months at a cost of $500 million to $1 billion. J&J shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, were up 1.5%. The pharmaceutical and medical devices unit will retain the J&J name and the company expects a tax-free spinoff.
Some analysts argued for investor caution.
""Historically, when the market becomes fully valued, we see a great number of spins being announced as companies look for alternate ways of creating more shareholder value,"" said Jim Osman, founder of research firm Edge Consulting Group. ""It's something worth noting for the investor."" 
Johnson & Johnson's Band-Aids baby shampoo and cough remedies have long been the face of the company.
But its pharmaceutical and medical equipment business, which makes cancer treatments, vaccines and surgical tools, is on track for nearly $80 billion in sales this year, far ahead of the $15 billion its consumer products are expected to bring in. 
The higher growth outlook comes despite disappointing sales of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine following a string of production setbacks https://reut.rs/3n6PwAM and fierce competition from rivals  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).

MONEY FOR DEALS?
Johnson & Johnson is following rivals. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Pfizer plan to spin off their joint consumer health business next year, and German drugmaker Merck KGaA sold its consumer health division to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co in 2018.  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA has also planned to spin off its consumer business.
""The firm's timing is surprising, as we don’t see any major catalyst for the move. However, if the consumer division no longer holds the deep pockets of the combined company, the risk of future consumer product litigation - such as the large talc settlement - may decrease,"" Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said in a research note. 
Johnson & Johnson's consumer division has faced nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos later linked to mesothelioma and caused ovarian cancer in women using it for personal hygiene, which the company denies.
In October, it created a separate subsidiary to hold the talc liabilities, which then filed for bankruptcy protection. 
J&J on Friday said its breakup decision had nothing to do with the talc litigation or the bankruptcy maneuver.
A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products.
The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the United States and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.
J&J's medical device and pharmaceuticals business also has faced tens of thousands of lawsuits for products including DePuy and Pinnacle implants, surgical mesh products and Xarelto blood thinner. 

The spinoff may allow the remaining J&J to be more acquisitive, said Jeff Jonas, asset manager at GAMCO Investors.
Wolk said it was ""not a wild assumption"" to expect it would add debt on the new consumer products company in order to generate some cash for J&J, but that both companies would have strong financial profiles, including a strong investment-grade credit rating for the consumer business.

Investing.com — At the end of the day on Friday, biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) announced a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion.
The company, whose shares closed the week at $631.20 and up 0.7% for the day, said the program is part of its broader capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value.
""With the strength of our balance sheet and our business, we see this as an opportunity to continue to invest in Regeneron,"" said Robert E. Landry, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Regeneron.
The company told shareholders that repurchases would be made at management's discretion through various methods, such as open-market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases, and other transactions. 
The program has no time limit, and no shares have been repurchased under the program yet. 
The company still has $1.8 million remaining available for share repurchases under the previous $1.5 billion share repurchase program it announced in January.

The company shares traded at $23.782
On Thursday morning, the company reported an earnings miss and revenue beat.
However, Stifel analyst Andrew Carter downgraded the stock to hold from buy, setting a price target of $24, down from $41. The analyst said that while he remains confident in the company's long-term growth potential, he miscalculated the effects of challenging category dynamics, input cost inflation, and the strain on the company's existing infrastructure. 
Carter added that he believes the company's softer fundamental performance in the near-term ""will obscure the platform's long-term advantages, impeding sustained investor enthusiasm and leaving the shares range-bound.""
Roth Capital reduced its price target on the stock to $35 from $40, maintaining a buy rating. In a research note, analyst Scott Fortune told investors that the slowing acquisitions mean he expects greenfield builds to be the majority of GrowGeneration's planned 15 to 20 retail openings. Fortune added that constraints from the ongoing supply-demand imbalance across West coast states will continue into 2022. 
Elsewhere the company's stock price target was lowered to $35 from $45 at Alliance Global Partners and to $44 from $50 at Lake Street."

(Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday rejected rule changes that would have allowed the listing and trading of the VanEck bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).
In March, the Cboe BZX Exchange Inc filed a proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the VanEck Bitcoin Trust under BZX Rule.
""The Commission applies the same standard used in its orders considering previous proposals to list bitcoin-based commodity trusts and bitcoin-based trust issued receipts -- that it must be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,"" the SEC said in its order.
""The Commission concludes that BZX has not met its burden.""
The move by the SEC comes after the regulator has twice delayed a decision on whether to approve an application.
The agency has not stopped futures-based bitcoin ETFs from going forward.
Analysts say the regulator is worried it is does not have proper surveillance over crypto exchanges to ensure adequate investor protections are in place.
Any entity requesting rule changes related to exchange listing a derivative securities product must agree to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with markets trading the underlying assets.
This allows the agency ""to obtain information necessary to detect, investigate, and deter fraud and market manipulation, as well as violations of exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws,"" the SEC said in its order.

Any future adoption of a bitcoin ETF by SEC Chair Gary Gensler could be key for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as it would allow financial institutions and retail traders to gain exposure without having to invest directly, analysts added.
VanEck filed its ETF proposal at the end of 2020, with Cboe BZX agreeing to act as VanEck’s exchange partner earlier this year.

Investing.com — Catalyst Biosciences Inc (NASDAQ:CBIO) shares tumbled more than 40% after it told investors it has made a strategic decision to discontinue the development of MarzAA, an investigational therapy designed to prevent acute bleeds in hemophilia patients.
In addition, the company said it will seek a buyer for its hemophilia assets.
In the last couple hours of trading before the weekend, the company's shares are trading around $1.74.
""Based on several factors including a recently updated feasibility assessment, we determined that we cannot continue to develop MarzAA through completion of the ongoing trials,"" said Nassim Usman, CEO of Catalyst Biosciences.
""Enrollment in our MarzAA clinical trials has been adversely impacted by several factors, including pandemic-related logistical challenges, competition for subjects, and increasing availability of prophylaxis therapy globally. Given these factors, it is no longer feasible for us to deliver topline data in 2022,"" added Usman.
The decision by the company to halt the development of the therapy will allow it to reduce the current burn rate by 40%.
While it will report on the data obtained in the Crimson-1 trial for subcutaneous MarzAA, CBIO will now focus its attention on its complement therapeutics and protease platform.
Alongside the change in strategy, the company also reported its third quarter earnings on Friday, recording a loss of 80 cents a share on revenue of $2.3 million. Analysts predicted a loss of 66 cents a share on revenue of $675,000.

(Reuters) -Attorneys representing more than 200 people claiming they were injured in last week's Astroworld Festival stampede in Houston said on Friday that they are filing another 90 lawsuits against the promoters of the event in which at least nine people died.
The announcement marked the latest legal action to follow last Friday's concert by Grammy Award-nominated rapper Travis Scott before a crowd of 50,000 at NRG Stadium that got out of control when fans surged toward the stage. 
""We represent more than 200 victims who were injured mentally, physically and psychologically at the Astroworld Festival,"" civil rights Attorney Ben Crump announced at a news conference in Houston.
At least 50 other suits have been brought against producer Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) Inc and Scott over the deaths and injuries related to the Astroworld Festival that was intended to signal the resurgence of Scott's hometown. 
Live Nation and Scott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Crump, who was joined by about a half-dozen other attorneys, said any one of several concert officials could have prevented deaths and injuries by stopping the show and turning on the house lights when the chaos in the crowd became apparent.
“Nobody should ever die from going to a concert,” he said. “So this lawsuit is not just about getting justice for them, but it's about making sure that the promoters and the organizers know that you cannot allow this to ever happen in the future.”
The nine people who were killed ranged in age from 14 to 27. A 9-year-old boy remains hospitalized in critical condition, police have said.
The latest victim https://www.reuters.com/world/us/astroworld-festival-death-toll-rises-with-22-year-old-texas-student-succumbing-2021-11-11 of the stampede to succumb was 22-year-old Bharti Shahani, a Texas A&M University computer science student who died late on Wednesday.
On Thursday, Scott asked victims to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid,"" according to a statement. The rapper earlier offered to pay for funeral costs and mental health counseling. 
Attorney Alex Hilliard said the concert never should have been approved. He accused Live Nation of being criminally negligent by not having an emergency plan, adequate medical staff or equipment
""We are talking about the largest organizer and promoter of festivals and concerts in the world,” Hilliard said at the briefing. “And when that happens, a failure of epic proportions on this type of scale, it is criminal.”

The attorneys did not attach a dollar figure to their lawsuits during their announcement.
Police are continuing to interview witnesses and are building a timeline https://www.reuters.com/world/us/timelines-major-focus-investigation-travis-scott-concert-deaths-houston-police-2021-11-10 of events leading to the deaths, Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said on Wednesday.

That was until this week, when his trust sold close to $5 billion worth of Tesla stock in the open market after Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users voted for him to sell 10% of his shares in an online poll he created. He sold an additional $1.1 billion worth of Tesla stock to pay taxes associated with the exercising of stock options.
More stock sales are expected given that he has sold only about 3% of his Tesla shares thus far. He has not disclosed what he will do with the proceeds, yet the cash haul has already created a buzz among major charities which are always vying for wealthy donors.
""His opportunity to have great impact is to donate very significant sums of money to leading organizations that are dealing with the most pressing problems with global poverty and access to healthcare,"" Melissa Berman, CEO of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that advises on charitable giving, said in an interview. 
Musk did not respond to requests for comment on his plans.
Musk's public philanthropy gestures have so far trailed other billionaires. Musk and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos have donated less than 1% of their net worth, whereas Warren Buffett and George Soros had given away more than 20% of their net worth as of early September, according to Forbes. 
It is possible, however, that many of Musk's charitable donations have not been made public. 
Musk signed the Giving Pledge in 2012, a commitment by some billionaires to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy in their lifetime or upon their death. In 2001, he set up the Musk Foundation, offering grants for the ""development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity"" among other causes, according to its website. 
Musk's foundation has over $200 million in assets, which ""isn't that big"" compared with his fortune, said Brad Smith, the president of Candid, a nonprofit information service that provides information on other nonprofits and foundations.
Earlier this year, Musk and his foundation offered a top prize of $50 million to the inventor who can come up with a technology to help remove carbon from the atmosphere. The prize has yet to be won.
Musk has also flirted with more ambitious philanthropy goals. He tweeted last month that ""if (the United Nations World Food Programme) can describe ... exactly how $6 billion will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.""
Musk was responding to a plea for a donation from David Beasley, the World Food Programme's executive director. Beasley tweeted he was willing to meet Musk to provide more details, and it is not clear if the two explored the idea further.
Beasley and the World Food Programme did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk has shown in previous tweets that he is thinking about ways to have a big philanthropic impact. In January, he asked Twitter users about ""ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems.)""
TAX INCENTIVES
There are also tax benefits associated with charitable giving. Under the U.S. tax code, most donations can be deducted from one's taxable income. 
""Almost any billionaire that you can think of donates money and minimizes tax bills,"" said Ray Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School where she is director of the Forum on Philanthropy and the Public Good.
Besides donating cash, there would be an additional tax benefit for Musk gifting Tesla stock. This is because shares that are donated to charity are not subject to capital gains tax, as they would be if they were sold.
""It's like a double bonus of donating. He is in a position where there's a substantial incentive to donate,"" said Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at the Ohio State University. 
Musk's younger brother, Kimbal Musk, who is also a Tesla board member, deployed that tactic as recently as last week. He gifted 25,000 Tesla shares worth $31 million to an unidentified charity.

With Tesla's shares hovering near record highs, Musk could take advantage of their current valuation by donating more of them, said Bob Lord, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies who studies tax policy.
""If you're going to donate stock, when do you want to donate it? When it is at its peak,"" Lord said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Friday, led technology stocks even as data showed consumers are growing increasingly wary of inflationary pressures.
The S&P 500 rose 0.65%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.45%, or 161 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.86%.
Technology stocks were pushed higher by big tech as Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB), formerly known as Facebook, and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), parent of Google, rose more than 3% and 1%, respectively.
As well as a rise in big tech, a rebound in semiconductor stocks from weakness a day earlier underpinned the broader tech sector, amid a rise in Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX).
Seagate surged more than 6% to record highs as investors continue to bet that the storage company will see a surge in demand from Meta’s investment to build out its metaverse platform.
Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), however, was underperforming the broader chip sector after Wedbush downgraded it to neutral from outperform, citing valuation concerns.“[W]hile we remain very bullish on both NVDA’s near term prospects and longer term opportunities … we simply find ourselves unable to justify lifting our multiple to levels that would continue to justify an outperform and as such we are shifting to a neutral rating even as our target price lifts to $300 (from $220),” Wedbush said in a note.
Energy turned red as oil prices slipped and are set for weekly drop amid concerns about the demand outlook following Covid-led lockdowns in Europe.
In health care, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was in the spotlight after announcing plans to spin off its consumer health business into a separate company. Its shares climbed more than 1%.
Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK), meanwhile, jumped more than 11% after reporting revenue that topped Wall Street expectations.
Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) reported a narrower third-quarter loss than expected, and pushed back its timeline on new production, triggering a slew of downgrades from Wall Street. Its shares fell 17%. “While we continue to like the longer-term prospects for the Endurance to carve out a slice of the commercial EV pickup truck market, with production being pushed back another few quarters we downgrade RIDE to Neutral,” BTIG said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields, which have cooled their recent jolt higher, recovered some losses following data showing consumer sentiment fell amid worries about elevated inflation.
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index fell to 66.8 from 71.7 in the preliminary November survey, the weakest reading since November 2011. Economists, however, were quick to downplay a potential fall in consumer spending.

Following are a few comments from analysts and investors:
JEFF JONAS, ASSET MANAGER, GAMCO INVESTORS
""It (spin off) makes sense in that it's a lower growth, lower margin business. Frankly, it's a struggle, ever since those manufacturing issues ... It's been a long, difficult recovery from that. And then COVID didn't really help and the lack of a cough cold season last year didn't really help.""
""They've always done a lot of smaller deals and occasionally done a big deal like Actelion. They certainly have a balance sheet that could afford to do anything. Ultimately, when they do finish the consumer spin off, they'll probably raise a little bit of cash and put a little bit of debt on the consumer business, which would give them more money to do deals.""
JOANNE WUENSCH, ANALYST, CITI
""Combined, each will likely deliver a dividend at least at the same of JNJ today and seeking to maintain its AAA rating.""
""We believe this decision was likely accelerated by the pandemic and the increasing move towards personal healthcare, telehealth, and technology-driven products."" 
DAMIEN CONOVER, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR 
""The firm's timing is surprising, as we don't see any major catalyst for the move. However, if the consumer division no longer holds the deep pockets of the combined company, the risk of future consumer product litigation--such as the large talc settlement--may decrease.""
""While we agree with management's assessment that the breakup will allow both new companies to operate with more focus and agility, we don't believe the current structure has impeded much operational execution in the past.""
ASHTYN EVANS, ANALYST, EDWARDS JONES
""For pharma companies, this has been something pretty common over the last 12+ years. We see more and more companies focusing on innovative drugs.""
""But this does come as a surprise, because J&J has been this huge healthcare conglomerate for so long, and the most diversified healthcare company in the world. So it does come as a surprise that they are choosing to end that, at least on the consumer side.""
S&P GLOBAL RATINGS 
""We view this as incrementally weakening the business strength, given the reduction in diversity and scale, even as this enhances the company's growth rate and profitability.""
JOSHUA JENNINGS, ANALYST, COWEN AND CO
""We do not believe JNJ's ongoing talc litigation spurred the decision, and we expect investors to look favorably on the transaction.""
SHANNON SACCOCIA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOSTON PRIVATE
""I think this is just an example of delivering value to shareholders by specializing the businesses. I don't think (talc liabilities) were a prevailing factor in this decision."" 
""The J&J management has realized that fact that the value that's been afforded to them by the market is probably not as much as one should expect given the strength and the leadership in those three businesses.""

(Reuters) - Movie buffs in the United States are back in theaters as the pandemic eases, but it is not clear if a sizeable chunk of the audience - families - might be just as happy watching from the comfort and safety of their homes.
The offer of new movies at home in the safety of living rooms may trump any clamor for the big screens, an issue Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co is addressing by shortening the time between blockbusters' release in theaters and on Disney+ streaming.
""It's about ping-ponging the audience from the theater and back to their TV and vice-versa. Disney obviously has an incredibly bright future. But it's gotten more complicated because the pandemic has forever changed consumer viewing habits,"" Comscore's media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said.
Theater owners underscore that movie slates are strong and cinemas are filling up.
""Watching movies at home was nothing new, but generally speaking people want to get back... that's being proved every week at the box office when new movies are opening that are really strong,"" said Phil Contrino, director of Media and Research at the National Association of Theatre Owners.
Movie theater chain Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) Inc noted ""anticipated blockbusters appealing to families and adults alike"" were in store.
But Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek was less certain when talking to analysts this week.
""We're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back"" with theatrical debuts, he said. Disney has shortened the time between opening on the big screen and at home.
""We're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+,"" he said, ""but at the same time to see if the theatrical market can sort of kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films.""
During the pandemic, Disney experimented with simultaneously releasing some big-budget movies such as ""Cruella,"" ""Black Widow"" and ""Jungle Cruise"" on Disney+ for an extra fee and at the cinemas.
""While COVID will be in the rearview mirror, God willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent,"" Chapek said.
Disney+ and rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) both reported tepid rises in subscriptions recently.
Comscore data shows that new box office launches in October grossed nearly 10 times more than at the start of the year, thanks to Disney's hits such as ""Shang-Chi,"" ""Black Widow,"" ""Jungle Cruise"" among others.
The data also showed ""Ron's Gone Wrong,"" an animated family film that hit theaters in late October, had about half of its audience in the 13-17 years age group in the first week. The latest James Bond movie ""No Time to Die,"" had 72% in the 25 plus age group after its release in early October.

Disney will have to strike a balance to keep theater operators happy while also producing new content to feed streaming subscribers, analysts said.
""Studios like Disney are still having to figure out that balance between the two,"" said Edward Jones analyst David Heger.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) -Louis Vuitton is considering opening its first duty free store in China on the emerging luxury island hub of Hainan, according to two sources, in a move that would mark a new approach for the world's largest luxury label.
The brand, which is the main profit engine of French luxury giant LVMH, is known for maintaining an iron grip on distribution  and famously never offering discounts on its leather monogrammed bags.
Yet executives are looking at the possibility of opening a duty free shop in the Haitang Bay shopping centre in Sanya, through an agreement with the mall's state-owned operator, China Duty Free Group, the sources said.
The plan, which would help Louis Vuitton capitalise on pent-up demand for luxury goods by Chinese shoppers - the sector's most avid consumers - was unveiled by brand executives at an early September presentation in Shanghai, according to a person who attended it.
Louis Vuitton originally declined to comment when asked about plans for a duty free shop in Hainan, which has boomed as a high-end shopping destination during the COVID-19 pandemic with Chinese consumers unable to travel abroad. The company provided a statement on Friday saying it is exploring opportunities in Hainan but not considering any options within the licensed duty free market. 
China Duty Free Group, the largest duty free operator in the country, did not reply to a request for comment. 
Some European and U.S. brands including Kering-owned Gucci and Ferragamo – both of which are highly exposed to travel retail compared to peers – sell products in the shopping centre, and there are signs of growing interest from high-end watch and jewellery labels.
But LVMH's higher profile fashion and leather goods brands, which include Dior, are not present in Hainan beyond selling their range of perfumes and cosmetics. A Louis Vuitton duty free shop on the island would be one of only a handful of such retail outlets worldwide for the label.
The global duty free industry was worth $86 billion in 2019, before the pandemic knocked the figure down by nearly half, to $45 billion in 2020, according to Generation Research, a provider of travel retail and duty free shopping statistics.
International travel restrictions mean that spending is being rapidly repatriated to China, and the Chinese government is keen to keep it that way, according to analysts at Bernstein.
Last year, the Chinese government tripled the amount that consumers could buy duty free in Hainan to 100,000 yuan ($15,635) a year and lifted certain purchase limits.
The disruption in international transportation caused by the pandemic hurt the grey market driven by ""daigou"", professional shoppers who buy high-end products abroad - in Europe, but also in South Korea - on behalf of mainland Chinese.
That helped duty free sales in Hainan, which has surged as much as fivefold compared to pre-pandemic levels, while a government target for sales of 700 million yuan by 2030 implies annual growth of 37%, according to Bernstein analysts.
""International travel will come back, but a strong company presence in Hainan will become paramount,"" they said.
Gaining a foothold in Hainan gives luxury brands access to a broader customer base. Yet Louis Vuitton and its rivals are wary of discounts, which erode the exclusive aura of their products, and of the risk of feeding a grey market if their handbags and clothes can be bought more cheaply in some places.
""As long as we are talking to real clients, end clients and not to daigou... we are OK with doing business in Hainan,"" LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts at an earnings presentation in October.
""If Hainan becomes a hub for daigou, that will be a different story,"" he said.

Bruno Lannes, a partner at consultancy Bain's consumer products and retail practice in Shanghai, said brands had to make sure that offering luxury goods at a lower price would not damage their image.
""If you go back to the original definition of luxury, luxury's exclusive, and exclusive means that you exclude consumers -- it's not for everybody, so that's the challenge."" ($1=6.39 yuan)

Gold prices have rallied recently, hitting a five-month high. Furthermore, because the Fed may not raise interest rates anytime soon, gold prices should move higher. Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect gold mining stocks Agnico (AEM), Kinross (KGC),  B2Gold  (NYSE:BTG), and Yamana (AUY) to rally 18% or more in price. Read on.The U.S. Labor Department has reported rising inflation, with a 6.2% annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October, its highest year-over-year increase since November 1990. The high inflation is eroding wage gains, and holding cash seems costly now. According to Ray Dalio, the founder of investment management firm Bridgewater Associates, there are better assets to hold than cash.
As a good inflation hedge, gold has attracted investors, hitting five-month highs lately. Spot gold has rallied 0.6% to$1,861.39 per ounce. Furthermore, with the central bank viewing current inflation as transitory, and exhibiting no inclination to raise benchmark interest rates anytime soon, analysts expect gold to hit $1,900 per ounce soon.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts predict gold mining stocks Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM),  Kinross Gold  Corporation (NYSE:KGC), B2Gold Corp. (BTG), and  Yamana Gold  Inc. (NYSE:AUY) will rally 18% or more in the near term.

Read on.The COVID-19 pandemic increased the popularity of financial technology or fintech, with lockdowns becoming the accelerator of digital finance adoption. However, a large population is still more comfortable with the traditional methods of payments and may prefer those over digital payment methods if given a choice. Thus, there remains uncertainty regarding whether the recent behavioral shift toward digital financial transactions will be sustained or not.
Community banks, the traditional fintech competitors, have ramped up technology spending by a median of 10% over the past year. On average, banks are expected to spend $1.69 million on technology in 2021. Banks also have eased credit standards for households and businesses by lowering rates and expanding credit lines.

Omar said she filed the measure, known as a joint resolution of disapproval, because of Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen's civil war, considered one of the world's war humanitarian disasters, and its human rights record.
The Biden administration announced on Nov. 4 that it had approved the sale of https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-state-dept-okays-650-million-potential-air-to-air-missile-deal-saudi-arabia-2021-11-04 280 air-to-air missiles valued at up to $650 million. Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) makes the missiles.
""We should never be selling human rights abusers weapons, but we certainly should not be doing so in the midst of a humanitarian crisis they are responsible for. Congress has the authority to stop these sales, and we must exercise that power,"" Omar said in a statement.

The measure's prospects for stopping the sale are slim, since it would have to pass the U.S. Senate and survive a likely veto. But Omar's action underscores continuing wariness about weapons sales to Riyadh among some lawmakers, despite the Biden administration's intention to limit weapons sales to the kingdom to ""defensive"" equipment.
While Saudi Arabia is an important partner in the Middle East, U.S. lawmakers have refused to approve many military sales for the kingdom without assurances U.S. equipment would not be used to kill civilians.

And since semiconductor sales are expected to continue climbing, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound companies Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and United Microelectronics (UMC). The stocks of these companies have an overall ‘Strong Buy’ rating in our proprietary rating system. So, let’s discuss.The current semiconductor shortage has been impacting several industries, primarily automotive and consumer electronics. However, huge investments by governments and enterprises to ramp up production should help the semiconductor industry increasingly meet skyrocketing demand.
According to Statista, global semiconductor sales are expected to reach $550.90 billion in 2021, representing a 25.1% year-over-year rise. Investors’ interest in the semiconductor industry is evident in the iShares Semiconductor ETF’s (SOXX) 17.7% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 6.7% gains.

(Reuters) -European shares closed their sixth straight week of gains at a new high on Friday, as strong results from Cartier owner Richemont rounded off a robust earnings season.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3% to a new peak of 486.75 points, and added 0.7% for the week. It has finished at record highs in four of the five sessions this week. 
Richemont surged 10.9% and was the best-performing European stock for the day, after it beat six-month profit estimates and said it was seeking investors for its loss-making Yoox (MI:YNAP) business.
The luxury sector also got a boost from France's LVMH, which gained 2.5% on news that Louis Vuitton was planning to open its first duty-free store in China.
French blue-chip shares also finished the week at all-time highs, with carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) jumping 4.4% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded its stock. 
""The earnings season is confirmation to markets that the underlying growth and demand picture is still very strong, even though there are companies talking about supply issues and margin pressures going forward,"" Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said.
""But you're probably going to get to a point where returns get smaller and you see more volatility - investors will have to make that adjustment in their minds.""
The STOXX 600 has seen several record highs in November, buoyed by dovish central bank messages, upbeat earnings reports and signs of post-pandemic economic revival. 
However, ECB policymakers acknowledged on Friday that euro zone inflation may decline more slowly than earlier thought, partly due to supply chain bottlenecks.
Further, Europe has become the epicentre of COVID-19 again, with Germany, France, and the Netherlands experiencing a surge in infections, and prompting some governments to consider re-imposing lockdowns, according to fresh data.
Travel and leisure stocks were the worst weekly performers, down 3.7% as investors feared new restrictions. 
Oil stocks led losses in Europe on Friday, dipping 1% as crude prices were dented by a firmer U.S. dollar owing to market bets of an earlier-than-expected Federal Reserve rate hike. [O/R] 

Mining was the best-performing European sector this week, up 4% as some relief over China's debt-addled property market, particularly with developer Evergrande, drove commodity prices higher. [MET/L]
Among other stocks, Italian infrastructure firm Atlantia rose 1.7% after raising its 2021 forecast, while Dutch oil and chemical storage group Vopak advanced 1.2% after beating estimates for quarterly profit.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>",UK and EU to intensify talks after London's 'change in tone',"By Kate Holton and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain and the European Union will intensify efforts next week to break their impasse over post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland, as Brussels cautiously welcomed a change in tone from London.
After meeting with Britain's Brexit minister David Frost in London, EU negotiator Maros Sefcovic said the two sides would now seek to make headway on key issues such as customs checks and the movement of medicines into Northern Ireland.
Relations between Brussels and London have deteriorated in recent weeks after Britain, unhappy with the deal it signed up to in 2020, threatened to trigger an emergency clause known as Article 16 https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/anger-tangle-trouble-is-another-brexit-showdown-looming-2021-11-09, potentially leading to a trade war.
Sefcovic said he hoped the two sides could build momentum by dealing with specific issues, rather than addressing more fundamental concerns that London wants to address, such as its desire to remove Europe's top court from any regulatory role.
Brussels also wants to see London reciprocate in the talks with its own concessions after it offered to cut some of the checks needed on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. 
Frost said ""significant gaps"" remained and Brussels must address the issues that London has raised. But he agreed that intensified talks would take place in Brussels next week, and that new energy and impetus were needed. 
""I acknowledge and welcome the change in tone of discussion with David Frost today, and I hope this will lead to tangible results for the people in Northern Ireland,"" Sefcovic told a news conference in London after the talks. 
STRAINED TIES
Since leaving the EU last year Britain has delayed the introduction of some border checks that were designed to avoid the need for a hard frontier between the British province and EU member Ireland. London says the checks are disproportionate and threaten Northern Ireland's 1998 peace deal. The EU says tight controls are needed to protect its single market of 450 million people.
The EU has cautioned Britain that triggering Article 16 - part of a deal Johnson signed in 2020 - would sour ties with the EU and destabilise Northern Ireland. 
Ireland has said the free trade deal that was underpinned by the Northern Irish agreement could also be set aside, leading to a possible trade war. 
One area of particular concern regards regulatory oversight in Northern Ireland, with London demanding that any governing role for the European Court of Justice be removed from the UK-EU divorce settlement.

However, Sefcovic said this remained a red line for Brussels, saying the court was the ""guardian of the single market rules"", rules that still apply in Northern Ireland.
""Without the European Court of Justice jurisdiction, there is no access to the single market,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Friday said it would split into two companies, hiving off its consumer health division that sells Band-Aids and Baby Powder from its pharmaceuticals and medical devices business.
The separate companies will have to divide up various legal liabilities. Here are the biggest: 
JOHNSON'S BABY POWDER
Nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer, which the company denies. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma. J&J has offered to contribute $2 billion toward resolving remaining talc litigation as part of the newly created subsidiary’s bankruptcy reorganization. 
OPIOIDS
J&J and the three largest U.S. drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) - in July agreed to pay up to $26 billion to resolve lawsuits by state and local governments claiming they fueled the opioid epidemic. J&J, which was named in 3,300 lawsuits, would pay up to $5 billion. The settlement has not been finalized and eight states are not participating. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $465 million judgment against J&J in lawsuit by the state alleging it deceptively marketed painkillers in ways that downplayed their addictive risks.
SUNSCREENS
Johnson & Johnson and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) on Oct. 29 in a court filing said they had reached a tentative agreement to settle lawsuits over the presence of a cancer-causing substance in several recalled J&J sunscreen products. J&J had voluntarily recalled four Neutrogena aerosol sunscreen products and one from Aveeno on July 14, after finding small amounts of benzene, a carcinogen. Consumers sued over the Neutrogena and Aveeno-branded aerosol sunscreen products.
RISPERDAL
J&J on Oct. 29 disclosed that it had settled most of the lawsuits it faced by thousands of men who claimed its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal caused them to develop excessive breast tissue and said it recorded $800 million in expenses in connection with the agreement. More than 9,000 lawsuits had been pending. The deal covered a case that one resulted in an $8 billion punitive damages award in 2019 that a Philadelphia judge later reduced to $6.8 million.
HIP IMPLANTS
J&J's DePuy Orthopaedics unit in 2013 announced it would pay up to $2.5 billion to resolve cases by people alleging injuries caused by its metal-on-metal ASR hip-replacement systems. It reached further agreements in 2015 and 2017 to resolve additional claims by patients, allowing it settle more than 10,000 cases in total. J&J says it has reached settlements in related class actions in Australia and Canada.
The company also has face lawsuits over its Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip implants. After being hit with several adverse jury verdicts, it agreed to settle thousands of cases in 2019. Lawsuits continue to be filed and J&J says 5,400 are pending.

PELVIC MESH
J&J and other manufacturers of pelvic mesh products have faced thousands of lawsuits by women claim they suffered painful injuries and difficulty in removing of the devices. More than 104,000 cases against seven manufacturers including J&J were consolidated before a federal judge in West Virginia and by 2019 had resulted in more than $7.25 billion in settlements. J&J in its Oct. 30 quarterly report said it had resolved the majority of cases but still faced 10,700 claims.

The cuts are a pillar of a restructuring plan under Chief Executive Officer Manfred Knof, who earlier this year took the helm of Germany's No. 2 bank to set it back on a path to profit.
""We have reached an important milestone,"" Knof said.
Commerzbank said it would now be able to move forward with the cuts in a ""socially responsible"" fashion and that the bank had already struck agreements on more than half of the 10,000 jobs to be cut.

New structures will mean around 30% fewer managers, Commerzbank said.
Last week, Commerzbank surprised with better-than-expected third-quarter net earnings and forecast a profit for the full year, defying analysts' predictions for a 2021 loss.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 11:39AM ET</span>",Toshiba plans to split into three after wave of scandals,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Scott Murdoch
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp outlined plans on Friday to split into three companies in an attempt to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul of the Japanese conglomerate after years of scandals.
A rare move in a country dominated by conglomerates, Toshiba's breakup comes the same week U.S. industrial powerhouse  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) called time on its sprawling empire and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announced it was splitting up too.
Founded in 1875, Toshiba plans to house its energy and infrastructure divisions in one company while its hard disk drives and power semiconductor businesses will form the backbone of another. A third will manage Toshiba's stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.
The plan, borne of a five-month strategic review undertaken after a highly damaging corporate governance scandal, is partly designed to encourage activist shareholders to sell their stakes, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.
A breakup, however, runs counter to calls by activist investors for Toshiba to be taken private and some major shareholders said the plan may struggle to get through an extraordinary general meeting due to be held by March.
The overhaul was announced after markets in Japan had closed but the company's Frankfurt-listed shares fell 4% at the open on Friday highlighting investor disappointment. The shares later recovered slightly in very low volume.
Toshiba's strategic review committee said the idea of going private had raised concerns internally about the impact on its businesses and staff retention while offers from private equity firms were not compelling relative to market expectations.
Private equity firms had also conveyed concerns about completing a deal due to possible conflicts with Japan's national security law and potential opposition from antitrust regulators, the company said. 
""After much discussion, we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option,"" Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.
CRISIS TO CRISIS
He said Toshiba, which hopes to complete the overhaul in two years, would have chosen to split up regardless of the presence of activist shareholders and that Japan's powerful trade ministry had not voiced objections to the plan.
One major Toshiba shareholder said other investors might still consider nominating a new board director to push though an auction process. 
""The option to take Toshiba private can create more value in a shorter period of time than the break-up,"" the shareholder said.
A portfolio manager at an activist fund with Toshiba shares said the plan was disappointing and unlikely to be voted through at the extraordinary general meeting the company plans to hold by March.
""The activists have two options now: you can sell and go away and come back in two years time or you can buy more shares and fight this thing at the EGM. I'm going to go and think about what to do,"" said the manager, who declined to be identified.
The 146-year-old conglomerate has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015. 
Two years later, it secured a $5.4 billion cash injection from more than 30 overseas investors that helped avoid a delisting but brought in activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) and Farallon.
Tension between management and overseas shareholders has dominated headlines since then. In June, an explosive shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded that Toshiba had colluded with Japan's trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year's shareholders meeting.
'EXCESSIVE CAUTIOUSNESS'
Earlier on Friday, Toshiba released a separately commissioned report that found executives, including its former chief executive, had behaved unethically but not illegally.
It said Toshiba was overly dependent on the trade ministry and problems had also been caused by its ""excessive cautiousness"" towards foreign funds and an unwillingness to develop a sound relationship with them.
Under the overhaul, Toshiba aims to return 100 billion yen ($875 million) to shareholders in the next two financial years. 
It also said it intended to ""monetize"" its Kioxia shares and return the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practicable, a change from a previous plan to return only a majority of the proceeds.
Other assets that will continue to be held by Toshiba include its stake in Toshiba Tec Corp, which makes printing and retail information systems.
Toshiba plans to complete the overhaul by March 2024.
A trade ministry official said the government would be interested in how the breakup affects Toshiba's businesses related to national security, which include radar systems.
Toshiba also reported on Friday that its second-quarter operating profit roughly doubled to 30.4 billion yen ($267 million) as it recovered from a slump triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
""It makes sense to split if the valuation of a highly competitive business is hindered by other businesses,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.

""But if there isn't such a business, the breakup just creates three lacklustre midsize companies.""

Let’s discuss.All three major U.S. stock market indices closed slightly higher yesterday. And CNBC’s Jim Cramer said that the investors should remain confident in the face of market weakness due to inflation concerns. Also, according to a FactSet report issued on November 5, 2021, analysts project earnings growth of more than 20% in Q4 2021.
Furthermore, the decline in weekly jobless claims to 267,000, an increase in discretionary spending, and the passage of a jumbo infrastructure bill by the U.S. House of Representatives last week have raised investors’ confidence. Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound growth stocks now.

Investing.com –  Warby Parker  stock (NYSE:WRBY) jumped more than 6% Friday as the eyeglass retailer raised its outlook for the year after its September-quarter sales and profit came in ahead of estimates.
The company expects current-year net revenue to come in between $539.5 million and $542 million, a year-on-year growth of 37% to 38%. It expects to close the year with a total store count of 161. It closed the third quarter with 154 stores after opening nine new ones during the period.
Higher store-count and more active customers drove net revenue up 32%, to $137 million. Active customers increased by 395,000, or 23%, to 2.15 million.
The net loss in the September quarter was $91 million, up from $41 million in the same period last year. This was mostly due to higher costs related to its direct listing on the NYSE in September.
Equity-based compensation and a stock donation to the Warby Parker Impact Foundation also offset the revenue growth and contributed to the losses.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 11:17AM ET</span>",Wall St Week Ahead: Some worry U.S. stocks rally more 'Fear Of Missing Out' than fundamentals,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record-setting run in U.S. stocks has made some investors wary as concerns grow over the market’s vulnerability to surging inflation, tighter Federal Reserve policy and moderating corporate profit growth. 
The S&P 500has gained about 24% so far in 2021, and on Monday finished a streak of eight straight all-time closing highs, the longest such stretch since 1997. The benchmark index has more than doubled since its March 2020 low at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, minting 65 all-time highs in 2021 alone, the second-most of any year on record, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). 
With those gains have come potential pockets of excess that some investors worry are emblematic of a market that is overheating, even as inflation soars to its highest levels in decades and the Fed prepares to tighten monetary policy next year. 
Some examples include the eye-popping gains for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster initial public offering of electric vehicle maker Rivian, which garnered a valuation over $100 billion despite having little revenue, as well as Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time peak. 
More broadly, the S&P 500 tech sector's valuation, based on forward price-to-earnings ratios, is near a 17-year high.
“There are very reasonably valued stocks and portions of the market, and so that is what I am trying to gravitate to,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. 
""But as somebody who has been doing this for a while, (the market) seems... excessive in certain respects.” 
His firm owns stocks such as pharmaceutical company  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and tech stalwart Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) for its clients.
Some of the worries may be starting to take their toll. Stocks have wobbled in recent days, endangering a sixth week of positive returns for the S&P 500. The CBOE Market Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, on Wednesday hit its highest level in a month. 
Based on the level of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said in a note on Monday that the S&P 500 should be trading at about 20.5 times forward earnings estimates, as opposed to its current level of 21.5 times. 
""We think retail flows, seasonal strength and institutional 'FOMO' have taken valuations above fair value,"" the Morgan Stanley strategists said, using the acronym for ""fear of missing out."" 
Some investors believe a startling rise in consumer prices to their highest level in more than three decades may accelerate the speed at which the Fed reduces its bond buying and eventually raises interest rates, potentially weighing on stocks and other risky assets. The central bank kicked off an unwind of its $120 billion government bond buying program this month. 
U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in early November to the lowest level in a decade as surging inflation cut into households' living standards, according to the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index released on Friday.
Market participants will also start turning their focus to next year, when S&P 500 profit growth is expected to slow to 7.5% after rebounding an estimated 49% this year following the pandemic shutdowns. 
Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, has been paring back his stock holdings in the past month, reducing equity exposure in some portfolios from an overweight position to neutral and moving more into cash and bonds. 
Investors have been ""handsomely rewarded"" in the wake of the Fed's easy money policies, he said. 
""The real question is what to do now,"" Morganlander said. ""Our viewpoint is that you want to try to be a little less risky.""
Investors next week will keep a close eye on the latest monthly retail sales report, as well as earnings results from companies including Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Nvidia. 
Analysts at BofA Global Research recently wrote that investors’ options bets “reveal mounting demand for leverage as investors chase the market's performance into year-end.” Taken together with the market’s recent run, “we view this as FOMO… not a fundamentally justified rally.”
A Capital Economics report, meanwhile, said the firm’s analysts expect a gradual climb in real yields and underwhelming economic growth to hold back the U.S. stock market. 

Whether investors, who have consistently scooped up stocks on pullbacks this year, will actually turn away from equities remains to be seen, in particular with November and December being historically a strong period for the market. 
""Are you going to fight the tape?"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. ""Selling into that strength, people would have caught themselves on the wrong side of the trade and nobody wants to be doing that, especially at year end.""

652,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>",Long COVID rare for college athletes; prostate cancer treatment shows no benefit vs COVID-19,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Long COVID rare in college athletes
College athletes who become infected with the coronavirus are very unlikely to have any lasting effects, a large U.S. study suggests. Researchers tracked more than 3,500 athletes from 44 colleges and universities and from more than 20 different sports who tested positive for the virus. Only 1.2% reported symptoms lasting more than three weeks, with 0.06% reporting symptoms lasting more than three months, the researchers wrote in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Four percent reported still having problems like shortness of breath or chest pain when they got back to exercising. Researchers found that one in four athletes with chest pain upon exercising had likely suffered some heart effects from the virus, whereas no athlete with exertional symptoms without chest pain appeared to have COVID-19 related heart issues. ""For the vast majority of athletes, this study shows that a return to play is possible without lingering COVID symptoms,"" study leader Dr. Jonathan Drezner of the University of Washington in Seattle said in a statement. ""But any new chest pain or cardiopulmonary symptom should be taken seriously. Even if initial cardiac testing is negative after a COVID-19 illness, chest pain while exerting yourself should be evaluated.""
Prostate cancer treatment shows no benefit against COVID-19
Small studies have suggested that a common prostate cancer treatment might protect COVID-19 patients from becoming seriously ill. A new, larger study found no benefit, according to a report published on Friday in JAMA Network. The treatment blocks the effects of androgen, a male hormone involved in fueling prostate cancer that also regulates a protein that plays a role in COVID-19 infections. Researchers studied 1,106 COVID-19 patients with prostate cancer, 24% of whom had received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Thirty days after COVID-19 diagnosis, there was no difference in COVID-19 severity or death rates between men who did or did undergo ADT. The result was the same when researchers restricted the analysis to 477 men who were closely matched on the basis of similar health status and risk factors. ""These findings do not support the hypothesis that ADT may be useful"" for patients with COVID-19, the researchers concluded. But this observational study, they point out, cannot definitively prove whether or not ADT reduces COVID-19 severity. The answer to that question will come from large randomized trials that are currently underway. 
Third vaccine dose safe for high-risk patients

Giving a third full dose of an mRNA vaccine to people with medical conditions that impair their immune system's response to the usual two-shot regimen appears to be safe in terms of side effects, new data show. Immunocompromised individuals have been advised by medical authorities to get a third full dose as a booster. While studies have generally shown improved antibody levels after the third dose, data on side effects have been limited. For a report posted on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota reviewed electronic health records of nearly 48,000 people who received three full doses of either the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. There were slightly higher rates of fatigue, nausea, headache, joint and muscle aches, stomach upset, and chills after the third dose than after the second shot. But ""reporting of severe adverse events remained low"" after the third dose, with rates at or below 0.01%, the researchers said. ""This study provides support for the safety of third vaccination doses of individuals that are at high-risk of severe COVID-19 and breakthrough infection,"" they concluded.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 10:33AM ET</span>",Column: Wall Street dancing to real yield tune amid inflation mood music,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - The specter of higher inflation, interest rates and bond yields usually spells trouble for stocks. But Wall Street continues to scale new peaks, driven by the increasingly entrenched phenomenon of sub-zero real yields.
The inverse relationship between the fall in U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities' 'real' yields to record lows and major U.S. equity indexes grinding to new highs has strengthened substantially in the last six months. 
It has been one of the few constants as Wall Street has hurdled several obstacles it might normally stumble on: historically high inflation and inflation expectations; the Fed tapering and preparing to raise rates; spiking bond market volatility; flattening and even inverted yield curves.
Long-held priors about these relationships are being questioned, and the stakes could not be higher: U.S. inflation is the hottest in over 30 years, the Fed still thinks it is ""transitory"", but pressure on policymakers is intensifying. 
There are bumps in the road, but equity markets march on. Low long-term bond yields lower the discount rate that's used to value companies' future cash flows in today's stock price - any backup in the discount rate redraws the map for equity along with the damage from related tightening of credit.
While real yields may push back higher as central banks prepare to tighten, few see them turning positive for a long time. Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy at Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), says we are in a ""new environment"" in which the old assumptions that rising interest rates and nominal bond yields are bad for equities has to be challenged. 
""More importantly for equities, real yields will become a problem if they enter restrictive territory,"" she says, adding that this is unlikely to happen for two to three years.
Meghan Swiber, rates strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), reckons 10-year real yields could remain negative for around 10 years. Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) published a similar forecast earlier this year.
FADE AWAY
Inflation-adjusted yields on TIPS have diverged from yields on conventional Treasury bonds in recent months. The difference between the two, the 'breakeven' rate and a closely-watched measure of inflation expectations, has risen sharply.
The fall in real yields is in some ways unsurprising, given the scramble from investors for inflation protection. In fixed income, TIPS and related investment vehicles such as TIPS exchange-traded funds, are in huge demand.
The 10-year U.S. TIPS yield has been deeply negative all year. After a notable rise at the end of the first quarter, it has slumped back, hitting a new low of -1.24% this week. Although still low by historical standards, the nominal 10-year yield has risen 65 basis points this year.
Strategists at Blackrock and Bank of America both say demand for TIPS ETFs has been ""incredible"", from investors wanting a short-term inflation hedge and others adding inflation protection into their longer-term asset allocation strategy. 
To the extent that real rates stay negative, growth remains above trend, consumer spending holds up and companies are able to pass on higher costs to their customers, equities could continue to perform reasonably well.
The S&P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs in calendar year 2021, the second most ever and only 12 away from the record of 77 set in 1995. 
Third quarter earnings were solid: 80% of S&P 500 companies beat forecasts, with that rising to 93% for the tech sector. Valuations are still high, but don't appear to be prohibitively so just yet.
Markets may be entering a critical period though if the Fed struggles to convince investors - and even itself - that it can wait until its taper schedule is over around the middle of next year before raising rates. 
And TIPS are expensive. Can real yields really go any more negative? Maybe, if Britain is any guide. The 10-year inflation-linked gilt yield is below -3.0% and has been sub-zero for a decade. 

Oliver Allen, markets economist at Capital Economics, believes real yields' sway over Wall Street will gradually fade as elevated inflation forces the Fed to tighten policy in real terms.
""The tailwind of falling real yields turning into a modest headwind is one reason why we think U.S. equities will struggle to make gains over the next couple of years,"" Allen says.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Explainer-Five legal questions raised by Elon Musk's unorthodox share sales,"By Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -It's been another wild ride for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors after billionaire chief executive Elon Musk pledged via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to sell 10% of his shares in the company. While the unorthodox way he went about it has raised eyebrows, it's unclear if he or Tesla have broken any rules.
The electric carmaker lost more than $150 billion in value after Musk asked his Twitter followers over the weekend if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-selloff-puts-risk-its-1-trillion-club-membership-2021-11-10 to pay new taxes being discussed by Congress. Nearly 58% said he should. 
On Wednesday, Tesla disclosed that Musk had offloaded https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/what-happened-with-musks-tesla-stock-sales-2021-11-11 3% of his stock in recent days. A sixth of those shares were sold via a corporate ""trading plan"" - a legal agreement that allows insiders to trade in the company's shares at a pre-determined date - to satisfy tax obligations. The plan, adopted Sept. 14, pre-dated Musk's poll. 
Musk sold another smaller block of shares on Friday. 
The filings did not say why Musk had sold that latest block or the previous 2.5%, and as of Friday it was unclear if the sales related to Musk's Twitter poll https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-tweets-by-teslas-elon-musk-have-moved-markets-2021-11-08. 
Spokespeople for the SEC and Tesla did not provide comment. 
The episode has again raised questions as to whether the celebrity billionaire breached any rules or the settlement he agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for tweeting in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private when in fact he had not. 
Here are five questions Tesla-watchers are asking: 
DID MUSK BREACH HIS 2018 SEC SETTLEMENT?
We don't know. That settlement, which the SEC tightened up in 2019, requires Musk to check any Tweets material to Tesla investors with a company lawyer, but Tesla and the SEC have not said whether that happened. Given Musk's Tweet appeared to tank the stock, he would be in breach of the settlement had he failed to vet it, said lawyers. 
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE TRADING PLAN SALES?
The ""Rule 10b5-1"" trading plans allow insiders to execute trades in the company's stock on a pre-determined future date, providing legal protection against potential allegations of insider trading on material non-public information.
It's common for corporate insiders to pre-plan trades, although they can trade without the plan too. As such, Musk's sales via the plan are not unusual. 
However, the plans themselves have more holes than a Swiss cheese, a problem SEC chair Gary Gensler has pledged https://www.reuters.com/business/us-secs-gensler-says-has-asked-staff-consider-new-rules-company-trading-plans-2021-06-07 to fix. 
""Some amount of chicanery is legal. And it is the looseness in the rules covering 'pre-planned' stock sales that are to blame,"" said Daniel Taylor, an insider trading expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
SO DID MUSK OR TESLA BREACH SEC DISCLOSURE RULES THEN?
That's unclear. While announcing a huge share sale on Twitter may be unconventional for most chief executives, it's the norm for Musk and investors know to watch Musk's Twitter account for news. So the Tweets per se don't appear to violate any rules.
In fact, several securities lawyers said Musk could argue that by explaining he had to sell to pay his taxes, rather than leaving the market guessing, he softened the blow to the stock. 
However, the pre-planned sales raise the question of whether Musk had always intended to sell some stock for tax -- or other -- reasons, but said he was doing so at the behest of his followers. Tesla has benefited from a meteoric rise that drove the electric carmaker's value to over $1 trillion https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-1-trillion-value-double-bonanza-musk-2021-10-25 last month.
Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer, said if Musk had concealed the real reason for his sales that could arguably be a disclosure violation, but at the same time there was a lot of public information on his reasoning for the sales.
SO WILL THE SEC TAKE A LOOK AT THE SALES?
The SEC constantly monitors market-moving events and has kept an eye on Musk in the past. Since 2018, it has queried Tesla on at least three occasions as to whether Musk's Tweets complied with the settlement, public filings and internal SEC documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act show. 
The agency's new Democratic leadership is also eager https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/corporate-crackdown-us-sec-takes-aim-executive-pay-2021-10-22 to bring cases against big companies and their top executives. 
""This case seems like yet another instance where regulators and private plaintiffs are going to spend years investigating what he knew, what he did, and why,"" said Ty Gellasch, head of investor group Healthy Markets. 
Still, the SEC may struggle to show Musk's actions harmed investors, typically a key threshold for successfully bringing a penalty, said lawyers.
WAIT, SO MUSK HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG?

When it comes to the securities law, time will tell. From a corporate governance standpoint, his actions are problematic, said lawyers. 
""If Tesla was a normal company, and Musk a normal executive, this kind of behavior would lead to a board rebuke or worse,"" said Fischer. But investors appear by now to accept Musk's ""oddities,"" he added.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 10:22AM ET</span>","Factbox-J&J's legal strategy for Baby Powder, talc liability","By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Friday said it would split into two companies, hiving off its consumer health division that sells Band-Aids and Baby Powder from its pharmaceuticals and medical devices business.
The historic breakup comes as J&J faces nearly 40,000 lawsuits alleging its Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer, which the company denies. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma.
Chief Executive Alex Gorsky told The Wall Street Journal that the talc litigation did not play a role in the decision to break up J&J. The company is aiming to complete the separation in 18 to 24 months.
In October, J&J undertook a separate corporate reshuffling aimed squarely at tackling its talc liabilities. Here is what J&J did:
TEXAS TWO-STEP
Using Texas’s divisional merger law, the company's Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc business split in two, offloading talc liabilities into a newly created subsidiary. The subsidiary, called LTL Management LLC, then moved to North Carolina. 
Within days of those moves, LTL filed for bankruptcy protection in Charlotte. In legal circles, the series of transactions is known as a “Texas two-step.”
J&J has offered to contribute $2 billion toward resolving remaining talc litigation as part of the newly created subsidiary’s bankruptcy reorganization. 
CONTROVERSIAL LEGAL MOVE
Earlier this week, a North Carolina bankruptcy judge overseeing the proceedings transferred the case to New Jersey, where J&J is headquartered. He also halted talc litigation against J&J for 60 days, extending to the healthcare conglomerate a legal shield already provided to LTL, the entity under bankruptcy protection.
Plaintiffs’ lawyers have decried J&J’s latest move to grapple with talc liabilities, accusing the financially healthy company of manipulating the bankruptcy system without filing for Chapter 11 protection itself. 
In Washington, Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation that would ban the use of divisional mergers to offload liabilities as J&J did, and also limit the ability of companies that have not filed for bankruptcy from obtaining legal protections extended to those under Chapter 11 court protection.
J&J, a blue-chip company with a market value exceeding $400 billion, has spent close to $1 billion defending against the talc litigation. Settlements and verdicts have cost the New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company about $3.5 billion more, although it has prevailed in some cases.
REUTERS INVESTIGATION

A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the U.S. and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called “misinformation” and “unfounded allegations” about the talc-based product. J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J’s appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company’s talc caused their ovarian cancer.

663,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 10:09AM ET</span>",Thanksgiving’s Price Tag Packs on the Pounds,"(Bloomberg) -- American households are about to eat their costliest Thanksgiving dinner ever. That is, if they can find the turkey.
As families tentatively plan to gather again after last season in lockdown, shoppers should expect to pay more for meat and all the trimmings. Whole frozen turkey prices are up about 20% year on year to an all-time high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, while retail prices for pie-staples like milk and sugar are at multi-year highs. Even alcohol costs, from beer to cocktails, are climbing as the kickoff to the U.S. holiday season approaches.
“Nothing on that Thanksgiving table is really going to be spared,” said Curt Covington, senior director of institution credit at AgAmerica Lending, which loans money to farmers. He says families should brace for the meal to be as much as 15% higher than last year, with supermarkets possibly selling out of smaller turkeys and turkey breasts. “You’re already seeing that there’s not going to be the type of bargains that there were in the past.”
America’s Thanksgiving holiday, always the fourth Thursday in November, lands at a time when runaway inflation, mangled supply chains and heightened demand are converging. Food inflation, an issue the world over, has been worsening in the U.S. as a shortage of workers at meatpacking plants and transportation companies leaves grocery shelves looking sparse. At the same time, costs for farmers including fertilizer, animal feed and fuel are soaring. Taken together, food prices continue to climb, helping to fuel in October the fastest annual growth in U.S. consumer prices since 1990.
Meanwhile, more people will be traveling this year after widespread vaccination efforts in the spring across America, increasing demand for the traditional foods from poultry to potatoes that normally grace Thanksgiving tables. Throw in gasoline prices, around the highest since 2014, and households are going to feel Thanksgiving’s pinch. Some families, looking to stay within budget, are buying smaller birds, planning fewer side dishes, and doing the unthinkable for this time of year: trying to avoid leftovers.
“It’s going to cost you more to host Thanksgiving and cost your family more to drive there this year,” said Daniel Roccato, a financial analyst at Credible, an online marketplace for loans. A family of four can expect to spend at least $26.57 to put the classic Thanksgiving dinner on the table, up about 10% from 2020, not counting the extra $18 a week drivers are spending at the pump, he calculates. “Without a doubt, due to the highest inflation in 30 years, the tab for this Thanksgiving dinner will be the highest consumers have seen.”
With prices rising ahead of the iconic American holiday, some are politicizing the issue. “This will be the most expensive Thanksgiving in the history of the holiday,” Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, wrote in a tweet Wednesday. “The American people don't deserve Biden’s #ThanksgivingTax!”
One key factor behind the higher prices is the Thanksgiving centerpiece: the turkey. According to USDA data, wholesale frozen turkeys weighing 16 pounds or less cost on average $1.41 a pound currently, up 23% year on year. Bigger birds are up about 20% from last year to $1.39 a pound on average.
To be sure, some grocers will actually sell turkeys for less than they paid to attract customers. “That’s something they’re intentionally taking a loss on,” said Grace Grossen, an agricultural economist at the USDA. “They’ll make them really cheap to get people in the door to buy their canned goods and other items.”
The rising prices are partially because there’s less turkey in cold storage than normal for this time of year, with turkey breast meat in especially low quantities. A lack of labor has made it harder to de-bone, pack and ship poultry at the same time some families are opting for smaller birds or cuts. Nearly two-thirds of American adults said they would spend Thanksgiving with just their immediate family, according to a Morning Consult survey conducted in October, meaning they don’t need the 20-pounders common for this time of year. Smaller birds, those in the 10- to 12-pound range, will be in hottest demand, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus.
One of those shoppers opting not to buy a whole turkey is Ellen Sheehy, who’s celebrating with just two other people. The 66-year-old will gather with only her sister-in-law and nephew this year because of Covid-19 precautions. She swapped a full bird for turkey breast in 2020 for the first time, and she’ll do it again this year, she said while shopping for groceries at  Target  (NYSE:TGT) in Manhattan’s Upper East Side neighborhood.
Worried about shortages, many Americans are shopping earlier than normal, stockpiling canned cranberry sauce and stashing birds in the freezer for weeks on end. According to data provider IRI, sales of Thanksgiving items in the three-week period ending Oct. 31 were up 63%, compared to a historical gain of 45% in prior years. The pickup was mostly driven by turkeys, pie filling, stuffing and stock. Middle- and high-income shoppers are more likely to buy early, with low-income shoppers usually waiting until closer to Thanksgiving to purchase ingredients.
Thanksgiving used to be one of the less-expensive holidays for the average American family that’s on a budget, said AgAmerica’s Covington. “That’s no longer the case,” he said, noting that the problems along the food supply lines are unlikely to abate soon. “This is going to drag through until Christmas, and possibly until the spring holidays like Easter. The supply chain is not going to get fixed anytime soon.”
In Fredericksburg, Texas, regenerative farm Roam Ranch is facing rising feed, grain and labor costs for its pasture-raised turkeys. The farm is also having trouble securing enough frozen and refrigerated trucks for shipping as skyrocketing fuel prices and a driver shortage plague the industry.
“Turkey prices for the upcoming Thanksgiving will be significantly higher than previous years,” said Roam’s co-founder Taylor Collins, noting that the ranch is seeing “disturbances in supply chains.” 
Not everyone can stomach the higher prices. At the West Alabama Food Bank near Tuscaloosa, families won’t be getting turkeys this year because of the rising cost of food, said Jean Rykaczewski, executive director. The food bank serves about 63,000 people across nine counties in Alabama, funded by donations, some government funding and grants.
“I’m not bringing in turkeys this year. If people want turkeys, they’re going to get whole chickens,” she said. That’s “because one, we can’t afford it. And two, we don’t have anywhere to store it because we’ve filled up everything we have anticipating not being able to get it.”

Investing.com — Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell Friday after Wedbush downgraded the stock, although its price target went in the opposite direction — rising to $300 from $220.
Analyst Matt Bryson downgraded Nvidia shares to neutral from outperform, telling investors that the company's current valuation is the reason for the downgrade with its share price trading at 55 times his 2024 numbers. 
""Conversely, we would have to roughly double our sales growth assumptions (from ~20% to ~40%) over the next couple of years if we were to continue to use a 40X multiple to value NVDA,"" Bryson told investors.
However, the analyst said that the ""unprecedented demand"" for data center and client offerings will see Nvidia exceed expectations when it reports earnings next week, while there is no ""negative catalyst"" for the stock, with the fundamentals improving. 
""Conditions have only strengthened in recent months creating the potential our future estimates will work off of higher numbers,"" the analyst wrote. He said the stock's 50% gain from the last earnings period makes it hard to justify an outperform rating at this time.
Nvidia shares have slipped 1.8% to $298.30. In 2021, the stock has rallied over 132%."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank announced on Friday that its former chief executive and chairman Hilmar Kopper has died at the age of 86.
His death followed a brief severe illness, the bank said.
Kopper oversaw the nation's top lender during a period of rapid global expansion. He assumed the helm as CEO following the assassination of Alfred Herrhausen in 1989, serving until 1997. He was chairman from 1997 until 2002.
"" Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has lost one of its most defining personalities,"" Chairman Paul Achleitner said. 
Deutsche Bank, founded in 1870, went on a global shopping spree during Kopper's reign, buying Britain's Morgan Grenfell in a deal that closed in 1990 and Bankers Trust of the U.S. in 1998.
He also oversaw the bank's move into the twin towers that accommodate 2,000 staff and dominate the skyline of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.

More recently, after years of losses and big fines for money laundering and its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis, Deutsche Bank has made cuts to return to profitability. It exited some businesses and trimmed its investment bank.
But Deutsche still has more than 84,000 employees and 1,805 branches worldwide, from New York to London, Hong Kong and Sydney.

The termination follows similar collapses in the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) space. Earlier this week, NFL veterans Eli and Peyton Manning-backed online grill retailer BBQ Holding also called off its planned SPAC merger.
With tightening accounting guidance and closer scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dealmaking in the SPAC market has slowed down from last year. 
Other proposed deals, including those of sports card firm Topps and the high-profile deal between SPAC magnate Bill Ackman and Universal Music Group (AS:UMG), have also failed.
Wynn and the blank-check company Austerlitz Acquisition Corporation I did not give a reason for calling off the planned deal. 
Craig Billings, chief executive officer of Wynn Interactive, the subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, said the company expects its requirement of heavy investments to decline meaningfully beginning in the first quarter of next year.

Austerlitz went public in February, raising $690 million. SPACs typically have two years to hunt for a company to merge with.
The SPAC's shares were down 1.2%, and Wynn Resorts' shares were down 0.4% in early trading.

Tencent's move meets the requirement from Chinese regulators to create an open internet, Douyin said in a statement, adding ""we are pleased that Tencent's copyrighted content can be shared on Douyin"".
Tencent said on Friday it was trialling a project to gradually allow third-party creators to use some of its copyrighted content in their works, and had issued invitations to other platforms to help promote them. 
The breakthrough follows years of tense relations between the two social media rivals and reprimands this year from Chinese regulators about the tech industry's ""walled gardens"" practice that prevents rivals' links and services from being shared on their platforms. 
In August, Douyin removed thousands of user-generated videos related to a television series produced by Tencent Video after the latter filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the company. 

ByteDance also said in the Friday statement it had repeatedly applied to Tencent's messaging app WeChat to restore the sharing and login functions of Douyin and its video-streaming app Xigua. 
WeChat users currently can share Douyin and Xigua links if they update to the latest version. Tencent declined to comment on this.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, as the inflation and rate hike fears of earlier in the week were offset by confidence in the ongoing strength of the economy. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 102 points, or 0.3%. at 36,024 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up by less than 0.1%. As such all three are on course for their first down week in five.
The week is ending in subdued fashion after data earlier showed U.S. inflation running at its highest rate in 30 years. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey reflected that with a surprising and sharp fall in November, although the survey's inflation expectations component only inched up to 4.9% from 4.8% and the 5-year inflation expectations component was unchanged at 2.9%. 
At the same time, the Labor Department reported that the number of job openings rose again in October, defying expectations for a modest decline. Vacancies are running at nearly 3 million above their pre-pandemic peak, as the service sector in particular scrambles for workers to meet reviving demand.
Among individual movers, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock rose 1.3% after announcing its intention to separate its consumer healthcare division from its pharmaceuticals and medical devices units, hoping that the market will value the two businesses more highly as separate entities. J&J’s current price-earnings multiple of 24 compares poorly to that of pure play pharma rivals (Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock, for example, currently trades at 40 times last year’s earnings).
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell another 2.9% after another SEC filing showed that CEO Elon Musk continued to sell stock, despite probably having raised enough to cover his imminent tax bill. Musk sold another 639,737 shares on Wednesday, according to a filing on Thursday. Musk indicated at the weekend he would sell some 10% of his overall holding, suggesting that he will still sell around another 12 million shares. 
 Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock continued to advance, however, building on its blockbuster IPO earlier in the week. The aspiring maker of electric delivery vans and pickup trucks rose 6.8% to a new high. 
That gives Rivian, backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford, a valuation of $110 billion, implying an extraordinarily high level of expectation from the company that has yet to sell a vehicle. But elsewhere Friday, there was evidence of what may happen if it fails to live up to those expectations. Lordstown Motors stock fell 11% after it once again delayed deliveries of its planned trucks.  Both it and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), another aspiring electric truck maker, have lost 80% from their peaks. 
In other news, Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) stock rose 16% after the luxury e-commerce platform said it was in talks to take a stake in Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter, a rival currently controlled by Switzerland's Richemont (OTC:CFRUY). Marijuana stocks also continued their advance, as strong earnings from Sundial Growers added to excitement about the prospects of legaliization in the U.S. (even if that may now come with a federal excise duty). Sundial (NASDAQ:SNDL) stock was up 16% while Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock was up 7.3%."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After more than a decade of explosive growth, China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny.
E-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value - during the 11 day event grew just 8.5%, the slowest rate ever, underscoring the headwinds for China's tech firms.
GMV had grown by at least double digits every year since Alibaba founded the festival in 2009 and built it into a global online shopping fest, dwarfing Cyber Monday in the United States. Last year, it extended the one-day event to 11.
But the state-backed Securities Daily newspaper criticised the focus on high turnover from sales for being unsustainable, chaotic and incompatible with China's new development path.
""The 'worship of turnover' is not only unsustainable in terms of digital growth but is also inextricably linked to chaos,"" the newspaper said.
Analysts said the weak performance this year also reflected how Chinese consumers have increasingly become weary and wary of the day's promotions and the quality of service.
Shoppers have also become more cautious about spending in general due to new coronavirus outbreaks and supply disruptions that have hurt sales and contributed to China's economy suffering its slowest growth in a year in the third quarter.
""The magic of Double 11 is fading,"" said Sharry Wu, Greater China consulting business transformation leader at consulting firm EY, referring to Nov. 11, which was originally an unofficial day to celebrate being romantically unattached.
""Brands have to understand after years of practice, Singles' Day is not their guaranteed sales booster.""
The event has historically been headlined by eye-catching bargains and livestreaming promotions. It is also a big sales boost for companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and L'Oreal, which sold more than 100 million yuan ($15.7 million) worth of products each over the 11-day event this year.
STRONGER RIVALS
Alibaba's dominance of the e-commerce market is also being chipped away at by rivals such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), which have aggressively competed for new shoppers in China's lower-tier cities. 
JD.com, which holds its own 11-day Singles Day shopping event, recorded 349.1 billion yuan worth of transactions, up 28.6% from the previous year. 
Over the past year, regulators have accused Alibaba and its e-commerce rivals of treating their customers poorly by spamming them with promotions, unfairly restricting their choices and allowing merchants to fake discounts, punishing them with fines in some cases.
Under such a spectre of regulatory scrutiny, Alibaba toned down the marketing hype this year, doing away with a rolling tally tracking transactions that had taken centre stage in previous years and said it was focused on sustainability. 
Still, Alibaba said a record 290,000 brands and 900 million consumers participated this year and 78 businesses saw their GMV grow more than 10 times compared with last year to more than 100 million yuan. A record number of luxury brands joined in, including Max Mara and Saint Laurent for the first time.
Unilever (NYSE:UL), the world's second-largest consumer goods company, told Reuters it saw double-digit percentage growth during the event, with its Dove, Omo, Lux and Vaseline brands propped up by about 150 hours of livestreaming, including by online celebrities Viya and Li Jiaqi.
""In skincare, what we generally see is that over 50% of Singles' Day sales can just come from one (livestreamer),"" Claire Hennah, global vice president of digital commerce at Unilever, said.
Citi analysts said that while the event's GMV missed their expectations, they were happy enough with more modest growth.

""Following an unprecedented year of multiple headwinds, we are relieved to see Singles Day momentum settle with a new norm of moderated growth,"" they said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's finance and economy ministries on Friday welcomed the early repayment by flag carrier Lufthansa of bailout aid it received during the coronavirus crisis.
The news showed Germany's federal government made the right decision when it helped Europe's largest airline group during the most difficult situation in its history, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told a news conference.
""The whole thing faced a lot of criticism at the time. Many believed the government would never see the funds again. In the end, Lufthansa would become a state company,"" Altmaier said.
""All of these fears, I would like to make this very clear again today, have not materialised. Lufthansa made an effort. It used the state money to get through the most difficult months of the pandemic,"" he said.
Lufthansa Group was saved from bankruptcy during the coronavirus pandemic by Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium with 9 billion euros ($10.30 billion) in financial support approved by the European Commission in June 2020.
Lufthansa only drew 3.8 billion euros out of that amount and on Friday, it said it had repaid the last 1 billion euros.
""It shows it was important and right for the state to help the company through difficult times and thereby secure thousands of jobs,"" Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is on course to become Germany's next chancellor, said in a statement.
Rising demand for travel, downsizing and the return of the market's confidence in the airline helped it repay the loans faster than expected, Lufthansa said. 
""On behalf of all Lufthansa employees, I would like to thank the German government and the German taxpayers,"" said Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. 

The ministries said the country's pandemic stabilisation fund's remaining stake of about 14% in Lufthansa would be sold by October 2023 at the latest.

However, the shares are currently trading below their 50-day moving average. And over the past five days, RCL has retreated 8.2%.
The company incurred massive losses last year due to pandemic-related travel restrictions. But recently announced positive data from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) for its COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment candidate, which was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%, buoyed investors’ optimism about the recovery of the cruise industry. RCL shares advanced following the news release. Furthermore, if the breakthrough drug does reduce fatalities, the demand for travel should rebound and enable cruise line companies, including RCL, to reverse their fortunes.
The company expects to generate positive cash flow by spring and be profitable for the entire year of 2022. However, operational challenges persist, and the demand rebound is uncertain because the possibility of new variants of the virus emerging cannot be ruled out. Also, the commercialization of the Pfizer drug is expected to take a while.

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will launch 10 electric vehicles (EVs) in South Korea by 2025, but has no plans yet to manufacture EVs in the country, Steven Kiefer, the head of GM's international operations said on Friday.
The No.1 U.S. automaker, which warned last year that persistent industrial action was preventing further investment in South Korea, builds EVs in the United States and China. It also has plans to build them in Mexico and Canada. 
Kiefer's visit after a Korean labour union delegation went to Detroit in June had led to speculation in local media that he could announce new EV production plans.
""We are not announcing any plans yet to produce electric vehicles in the country, so stay tuned for that,"" Kiefer told a media briefing.
GM's South Korea unit builds about 600,000 vehicles a year, shipping many to the United States including the popular Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV, and employs about 12,000 people. It reported an operating loss of 309 billion won ($262 million) last year.
When asked about the impact of the chip shortage at GM's Korea plants, GM Korea Chief Executive Kaher Kazem said production volume in the country this year was down about 25% versus last year, but the chip shortage seemed to be easing. 
Kiefer also said GM's partnership with South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution was ""very bright"".
""Clearly more (battery) capacity is going to be required, so stay tuned for some additional announcements,"" he said.
GM and LG Energy Solution are building two battery cell manufacturing plants with a combined annual production capacity of about 70 gigawatt hours in the United States, which could power about 1 million EVs. 

In October, GM said LG units had agreed to reimburse it for $2 billion in estimated costs and expenses associated with a recall of Bolt EVs.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said it would begin to earn a modest profit from its coronavirus vaccine as the world learns to live with the virus and the drugmaker is in talks with several countries about new orders for delivery next year.
AstraZeneca made a commitment to sell the shot developed with Oxford University at cost during the pandemic and in a press conference on Friday said low-income nations would continue to receive the vaccine on a no-profit basis, while a post-pandemic commercial approach would apply to other new orders even as infections in Europe rise again.
The Anglo-Swedish company's third-quarter results showed the vaccine contributed one cent to core earnings per share of $1.08, a rise of 14%. Total product sales jumped 49% to $9.74 billion, as its vaccine sales topped $1 billion.
""We started this project to help ... but we also said that at some stage in the future, we will transition to commercial orders,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told journalists.
""It will never be high priced. Because we want the vaccine to remain affordable to everybody around the world,"" he added.
Soriot, a French national, said the virus was becoming endemic, a term for a background level of infections that is part of everyday life. 
Talks about new orders with undisclosed countries were underway, mainly for delivery next year, with some prospective customers focusing on booster shots, Soriot said.
AstraZeneca unveiled plans this week to set up a separate unit to focus on its coronavirus efforts and other respiratory infections. It said on Friday the unit would independently manage production and distribution. 
PROFIT FALLS SHORT
Shares of the FTSE 100 drugmaker were down 3.4% at about 91.22 pounds at 1209 GMT as overall third-quarter profit fell short of analysts' expectations. 
There were strong performances of core products like kidney disease treatment Farxiga and established asthma drug Symbicort, and from the addition of rare-disease specialist Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) from July 21, thanks to last year's $39 billion takeover deal.
However, integration costs related to that deal ate into profits, as did a $1.2 billion writedown for an experimental kidney disease drug AstraZeneca acquired in 2012, with overall expenses also rising on investments into the drug pipeline.
Top selling drug Tagrisso for lung cancer also posted lower-than-expected growth in sales due to price cuts in China.
AstraZeneca said a profit boost from the vaccine in the fourth quarter would make up for costs related to its antibody cocktail for preventing and treating COVID-19, as it stuck with its earnings forecast for the year.
Liberum analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note the higher expenses would raise some concerns but the reiteration of guidance was reassuring. 
AstraZeneca's vaccine has had a tumultuous journey, with its not-for-profit strategy and challenges around efficacy data, supplies and links to rare blood clots, fuelling speculation on whether it would want to keep the business in the long term.
The drugmaker and its Indian manufacturing partner, Serum Institute, have supplied more than 1.5 billion vaccine doses as of the end of September, compared with more than 2 billion from the rival alliance of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech.
Pfizer this month forecast 2021 and 2022 sales from its COVID-19 vaccine of at least $65 billion overall, topping estimates. However,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) slashed its 2021 sales outlook for its shot by as much as $5 billion, on production hiccups.

Including sales from the vaccine in the fourth quarter, AstraZeneca now expects 2021 revenues to grow by a mid-to-high twenties percentage. It previously expected sales to grow by a low-twenties percentage excluding the shot. 
Analysts on average were expecting third-quarter profit of $1.28 per share on sales of $9.4 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) reported core profit above market estimates on Friday and raised its full-year outlook for the third time, boosted by its U.S. unit T-Mobile, along with growth in European business.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDA AL) stood at 9.66 billion euros ($11.05 billion), beating consensus estimates of 9.35 billion euros in a poll of analysts published by the company.
The company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA AL to around 38 billion euros, up from the previous outlook of at least 37.2 billion euros.
""Our businesses are performing even better than expected,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Höttges said in a statement. ""Following strong figures in the first nine months, we are setting the bar for 2021 a little higher. 
T-Mobile, which accounts for three-fifths of group sales, has been gaining subscribers following its merger with Sprint and as it rolls out its 5G service. 
In the latest quarter T-Mobile added 1.3 million customers who pay their bills monthly, lifting its subscriber base to 106.9 million customers. Deutsche Telekom has 52.2 million customers in Germany and 46.4 million in rest of Europe.
Deutsche Telekom now owns 48.4% of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), within touching distance of majority ownership over the U.S. operations. 
The telecoms operator's third-quarter revenue increased by 2% to 26.88 billion euros, but fell short of consensus estimates of 27.15 billion euros. 
On the back of growth across the board, the company increased its dividend to 64 euro cents from 60 euro cents last year. German government owns a 30.5% stake in the company.

Apart from an increase in subscribers, growth in the number of tourists across Europe following relaxation of the pandemic-related restrictions had led to a recovery in roaming revenue.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock jumped more than 5% in Friday’s trading as the company revealed its plan to split its consumer health business into a separate listed entity.
The separation is expected to take 18 to 24 months to complete, J&J said in a release.
The consumer health segment that houses brands such as Neutrogena, Band-Aid, Listerine and Tylenol, is expected to generate revenue of approximately $15 billion in the ongoing financial year. That compares with the roughly $77 billion generated by the pharmaceutical and medical device unit, which also sells the Covid-19 vaccine. 
J&J’s Covid vaccine is one of the only three allowed to be sold in the U.S. The other two belong to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), respectively.
J&J is the third big company in less than a week to have announced separation of their businesses,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Toshiba (T:6502) before it. It also echoes a similar process also underway at the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).  Conglomerates have tended to traded at discounts to specialist companies in the past, and J&J's current price-earnings multiple of 24 compares poorly to - for example - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock, which trades at over 40 times earnings.
As per a reorganization announced on Friday, Alex Gorsky will serve as Executive Chairman of J&J and pass the Chief Executive Officer's role to Joaquin Duato.
According to The Wall Street Journal, J&J has planned the restructuring so as to be tax-free. It is likely J&J would spin out its consumer unit and hold a stock offering, but no decision has been made, Gorsky told the Journal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial services-focused private equity firm Lightyear Capital has closed its fifth flagship fund at $1.6 billion, drawing in more money than it initially targeted as investors seek out specialist capital managers amid high valuations.
The New York-based buyout firm, established in 2000 by former PaineWebber bankers including Donald Marron after the investment bank's acquisition by UBS Group, had earlier planned to raise around $1.25 billion, well above the $950 million Fund IV that Lightyear closed in 2017.
""Specialization means a differentiated story for investors, but it also means better opportunities and significantly better results because we understand the companies and the industry in which we're participating,"" Lightyear Managing Partner Mark Vassallo told Reuters.
A larger fund will allow Lightyear greater flexibility to invest in companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of between $30 million and $40 million, up from the $10 million to $20 million range it targeted with its third flagship fund, according to Managing Director Stewart Gross.
Fund V is expected to be around 40% invested by the end of 2021. Lightyear has already used the fund to make four investments and is about to close a fifth deal, Gross added.
Investors have plowed money into private equity firms to secure higher returns during a period of historically low interest rates and readily-available cheap debt.
This huge pool of cash has pushed up valuations of companies that private equity firms typically target, as well as heightened competition for such assets.
To help combat this, Vassallo said Lightyear has been pursuing thematic investing within financial services, including embedded finance, where payments functions exist within non-financial businesses such as healthcare platforms. 
This allows Lightyear to not only make targeted investments in the financial services sector, but also scout smaller, disruptive startups that might emerge as competitors to existing investments.
The tactic also identifies businesses which can be acquired later to supplement an existing Lightyear investment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Friday, looking to end a volatile week on a positive note with Chinese retail giants and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in the spotlight.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 105 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 38 points, or 0.2%.
Despite the expected opening gains, the three major indices are on course to end the week lower, snapping five-week winning streaks, after the October consumer price index showed inflation running at an annual rate of 6.2%, a pace not seen in more than three decades. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.1% for the week at Thursday’s close, the broad-based S&P 500 is 1% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 1.7%.
The inflation report added to recent data, including nonfarm payrolls earlier this month, that point to a burgeoning economic recovery, increasing the pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
After a busy week of earnings, Friday is relatively light in terms of corporate results with a lot of the focus being on the Chinese e-commerce sector in the wake of the Singles Day shopping festival.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), China’s largest ecommerce platform, reported that its sales grew 8.5%, the first time in history that its growth has slowed below 10%. Smaller rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) shone after reporting that its sales rose around 29% from the previous year. 
Elsewhere, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will also attract the interest of investors after the Wall Street Journal newspaper reported that the company plans to split into two, separating its consumer health division from its large pharmaceuticals unit. That adds to a trend of corporate simplification already evident this week in General Electric's and - earlier on Friday - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s decision to break themselves up along business lines.
The economic data schedule centers around the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index for November, which is seen improving to 72.4 from the previous month’s 71.7. 
Also due are the number of U.S. job openings in September, which are likely to have dropped to 10.3 million from 10.439 million in August.
Crude prices weakened Friday, weighed by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar which makes the commodity more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.
The release of the Baker Hughes rig count and CFTC positioning data round off a volatile week in the oil market, while eyes will also be on Glasgow as the U.N. climate summit concludes. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $80.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.5% to $81.67. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,850.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1448.

Investing.com – ADRs of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) fell more than 4% in Friday’s premarket trading as the company’s third-quarter profit fell short of estimates.
Disappointing sales in China from its top-selling cancer drug Tagrisso, along with the high costs of integrating its recent acquisition, Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), both weighed on the bottom line, which was only partially offset by the start of profits booked from its Covid-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria.
Vaxzevria achieved $1.05 billion in sales in the quarter. The company had previously said it would end its policy of selling the drug at cost price once the pandemic emergency was over. It will still continue to sell the drug at cost to developing nations. Its ability to generate returns on Vaxzevria, meanwhile, is likely to be constrained by higher the loss of market share to vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which have shown higher efficacy rates.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) expects its Covid vaccine to bring in $36 billion in sales this financial year, although Moderna was recently forced to revise down its sales guidance due to manufacturing problems. It has also been partially suspended in various countries due to suspected links to heart inflammation in some age groups.
The company’s profit per share in the September quarter came in at $1.08 per share. Total product sales jumped 47% to $9.74 billion. Total revenue was $9.86 billion.
It now expects its annual revenue, including from Covid vaccine, to grow by around 27%. It expects EPS to be around $5.23.

The company said 3,016 charging stations were contracted or sold in the September quarter, up 351%.
Blink recorded $6.4 million in third-quarter sales, with the bulk coming from $4.8 million in product sales, driven by higher sales of both residential and commercial chargers as well as revenue from its recent acquisition of Europe’s EV-charging operator Blue Corner.
Service revenue rose more than five times driven by increased number of chargers on its network, which also led to their higher utilization.
Net loss more than tripled to $15.3 million and was higher than expectations owing to stock-based compensation, costs related to recent acquisitions and increased hiring in sales, operations and IT departments.

YONGIN, South Korea (Reuters) - South Korean engineer Kim Gwang-ho was almost certain he would receive ample compensation from the whistleblower program of the U.S. auto safety regulator for a tip-off about safety lapses at Hyundai Motor Co, his employer of 26 years.
Now, at the end of a five-year ordeal, the award from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has made Kim more than $24 million richer, and he aims to set up a foundation to promote responsible corporate culture.
""The compensation I expected from the whistleblower program in the United States outweighed the sacrifice I had to make in South Korea,"" Kim, 59, who worked on the firm's quality strategy team, told Reuters on Friday. 
Kim's action led to an agreement last year by Hyundai and its affiliate, Kia, which are among the world's top 10 automakers by sales, to pay a record civil penalty of $210 million over recalls involving nearly 1.7 million vehicles. 
Kim, who plans to set up a YouTube channel to teach people how to expose their employers' bad behaviour, learned about the U.S. law through training that Hyundai provided, and which inspired him to come forward, he said in an interview. 
""(The amount) is not incredible or anything like that, I'd say it's about right,"" Kim said in the living-room of his home in the city of Yongin, south of Seoul, the capital.
""It's the right amount when you look at what I had to sacrifice, how much I had to work on this,"" added Kim, who said his action cost him his job and severed ties with long-time colleagues. 
""After my report, I believe that automakers now know that anyone can blow the whistle and they cannot hide anything.""
Hyundai Motor Group did not have comment.
BIGGEST WORLDWIDE
Tuesday's reward was the first by the U.S. regulator and the biggest in a whistleblower case in the automobile sector worldwide, says law firm Constantine Cannon, which represented Kim.
It comes as the regulator and U.S. transport authorities ready regulations for a programme for whistleblowers in the automotive sector that Congress created in 2015.
The regulator's whistleblower program aims to help it police the automotive industry by rewarding providers of information about safety violations. Successful whistleblowers get a share ranging from 10% to 30% of the fines or penalties collected.
The amount of Kim's award recommended by the regulator is 30% of an upfront payment of $81 million agreed by Hyundai and Kia. 
""I was relieved to hear that it finally came to an end,"" he said, adding that he and his law firm were checking if he stood to receive more. 
In the summer of 2016, Kim told the U.S. regulator Hyundai was not taking enough action to resolve an engine fault that increased the risk of crashes, citing an internal report from the strategy team to management.
The vehicle recalls between 2015 and 2017 had ranked among the firms' biggest such exercises in the United States.
Investigation by the regulator begun in 2017 led to its decision that the firms had failed to recall the vehicles in a timely fashion, bringing last year's $210-million penalty. 
In 2018, Reuters reported that U.S. prosecutors were investigating whether Hyundai's vehicle recalls were done properly.

Today, Kim feels his effort was not entirely successful, however.
""Those who tried to cover up recalls at that time are still working as executives at affiliates of Hyundai Motor Group, which I think is the painful reality even after I managed to successfully blow the whistle to correct things,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - AirAsia X (AAX) creditors have agreed to a restructuring that will pay just 0.5% of debt owed and end its existing contracts, the Malaysian long-haul low-cost airline said on Friday.
The airline has also reached a deal with its largest creditor, Airbus to reduce a multi-billion dollar order for 78 A330neo widebody planes and 30 A321XLR narrowbodies. AAX had been Airbus' biggest customer for the A330neo.
AAX now plans to take 15 A330neos and 20 A321XLRs, an airline spokesperson said.
""We confirm that we have agreed to reduce the airline's outstanding orders,"" an Airbus spokesperson said. ""This is another example of how we have worked with customers to adapt to the impact of the pandemic.""
AAX said 99% of creditors across three groups had voted in favour of its plan to restructure 33.65 billion ringgit ($8.1 billion) of liabilities to avoid liquidation.
Around half was owed to Airbus for terminating airplane orders, a 127-page explanatory statement for the creditors meeting seen by Reuters showed.
AAX said the results will be presented for court approval in the coming weeks after which it will start a recapitalisation, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.
The airline said its cost base will be significantly below that of regional competitors after the restructuring.
AAX shares closed 25% higher on Friday. 
Last month, the airline warned of liquidation if creditors did not agree to the plan, which will be followed by a 500 million ringgit equity raising.
It is one of many carriers in the Asia-Pacific region to have entered a court-overseen debt restructuring to survive the pandemic. Others include Malaysia Airlines, Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Philippine Airlines.
The first class of AAX creditors included airports, financial institutions and maintenance providers, the explanatory statement shows.
The second class included engine suppliers, lessors, trade creditors, travel agents and passengers, the document said, while Airbus was in the third class by itself.
AAX also said it was in negotiations with lessors of 29 planes and certain other creditors on commercial terms for continued or future business relationships.
The 0.5% of debt owed to each creditor will be paid from operating cash flow one year after the restructuring goes into effect, the airline said in the document.

AAX also proposed that if it were to garner more than 300 million ringgit in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, lease rentals and restructuring costs during its 2023-2026 financial years, all creditors except Airbus would be entitled to 20% of those earnings.

For Alibaba, which first started the practice as a single-day event in 2009, sales grew at their slowest pace ever. China’s largest ecommerce platform, which converted the event into an 11-day affair last year, said gross merchandise volume grew 8.5% to 540.3 billion yuan ($84.5 billion), the first time in history that growth has slowed below 10%.
GMV is the most commonly used barometer to determine the size and health of an ecommerce site and signifies the total value of products and services sold on the platform.
The event also provides the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and L’Oreal (PA:OREP) with a ready outlet to push their sales.
Sales were much better at JD.com which recorded 349.1 billion yuan worth of transactions, up around 29% from the previous year. It also benefited from giving more time to consumers on the opening day without making them put an all-nighter.
Alibaba was under pressure this time given the scrutiny it has been under from Chinese antitrust and Internet authorities. The company consequently went slow on promoting the event. Other reasons behind the muted sales could have been costlier products, consumer fatigue and the fest losing its appeal.
Still, Alibaba managed to pull in a record 290,000 brands and 900 million consumers on to its platform during the fest. It said 78 businesses saw their GMV grow more than 10 times compared with last year to more than 100 million yuan."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In late October, as a growing liquidity crisis across China's property sector walloped developers' bonds, a group of Chinese finance professionals got together on the messaging app WeChat to pool their funds and buy the unloved debt.
The first target was a 5.3% January 2022 bond issued by a unit of Yango Group, trading at around half its face value and yielding in excess of 400%. 
Punters were invited, via WeChat, to pool a minimum of $50,000 each for a chance to double their money, with a downside likely limited at 50%, according to a source who was invited to participate.
Yango, whose Chinese name means Sunshine City, had been hit by a series of credit rating downgrades over its weakened access to funding and would go on to reach agreements with investors to extend other debt payments to avoid a default.
""We have $100,000 secured, if we collect $200,000 it's READY GO"" the organiser told a WeChat group in messages seen by Reuters. Less than an hour later on Oct. 22, the group had collected more than $300,000 as the organizer urged calm - before pitching another group buy of a Greenland Holdings bond.
Yet, since the October WeChat group buy, the price of the Yango unit's January 2022 bond has fallen more than 50% and the company has extended its repayment date by a year.
Even as worries over the payment abilities of Chinese developers continue to fester, driving the spread - or risk premium - on their riskiest dollar debt to record highs, some investors in China and overseas see similar opportunities in discounted Chinese debt. 
The search for bargains has heated up after the selling extended to investment-grade (IG) names, pushing their spreads to a near-seven-month peak, and on hopes that regulators may ease property curbs to avoid a sector-wide collapse. 
A series of narrow escapes from defaults by China Evergrande Group, whose cash crunch sparked the sell-off, has helped to soothe nerves, though developers have continued to miss or make late payments on their debt.
""The widening of IG spreads provides select opportunities for investors to gain exposure to high quality issuers,"" said Shaw Yann Ho, head of Asia fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, adding that included some better capitalised state-owned firms in a position to snap up distressed assets in the sector. 
Recent rating downgrades, such as S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s move to relegate Shimao Group Holdings to speculative grade, have also helped to clarify risks and could serve to stabilise investment-grade spreads, investors say.
Ho said supportive policies, including faster mortgage approvals and local government efforts to continue infrastructure construction would further benefit investment-grade firms. 
Hopes for more support have risen as China's economy falters under new measures to control COVID-19 outbreaks and power shortages that have hit factories.
But policy sources say the country's central bank is expected to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy, while authorities look increasingly likely to stand firm on policies to curb excess borrowing by property developers.
That could continue to spell trouble for Chinese developers with bonds worth more than $90 billion maturing in the next year, according to Refinitiv data.
Edward Chan, director, corporate ratings at S&P Global, noted that all of the nearly 30 recent S&P rating actions on Chinese issuers had been negative. S&P has forecast continued market volatility in Chinese debt into 2022, with large debt maturities pushing more offshore defaults.

But Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, said that default rates of around 20% would be required for investors to lose money, noting that he had seen money ""flooding into the sector"" from global high-yield investors. 
Forecasting a bumpy ride, James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd, said that while he thinks the market is ""really, really close"" to the bottom, limited market liquidity will exaggerate moves both up and down.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Richemont in talks to sell stake in online business to Farfetch,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Richemont is in advanced talks with online retailer Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) about selling it a minority stake in loss-making Yoox Net-a-Porter (MI:YNAP) in a move likely to appease investors critical of the luxury goods firm.
Richemont, which owns brands such as Cartier and Piaget, said on Friday it would also invite other firms besides Farfetch to participate in turning YNAP into a neutral, industry-wide retail platform with no overall controlling shareholder. 
Shares in the company controlled by South African billionaire Johann Rupert surged as much as 10% to a record high after the YNAP news and better than expected first-half results, outperforming the European retail goods sector.
""An early Christmas present for Richemont shareholders,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox. 
Richemont has invested heavily in YNAP, trying to make it less capital intensive by moving away from owning all of its inventory to a hybrid model where some goods are owned by third parties - inspired by Farfetch's asset-light model.
But YNAP's persistent losses have fueled speculation about a possible sale and there were reports this week that activist hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) had built a stake in Richemont and was pressing it to improve its performance.
Long-time Richemont shareholder Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) told Reuters it agreed with activist investors that the company was significantly undervalued, saying the key reason for this was YNAP's performance. 
Chief Financial Officer Burkhart Grund declined to comment on whether Third Point had built a stake but made clear the company's goal was to cede control of YNAP.
""Neutral platform means no controlling shareholder,"" Grund told reporters on a call. 
Richemont Chairman Rupert again ruled out the idea of a merger with French luxury goods rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP), saying its previous rejection of a deal was a ""binding statement"".
""We made a clear statement that Richemont is not for sale and we are not interested in merging, so we believe in our own businesses,"" Rupert, who controls the majority of voting rights in Richemont, said.
Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said separating YNAP from Richemont would create material shareholder value and he also applauded the company's strong performance in jeweler and its improvement in watches this year.
Richemont reported a jump in net profit to 1.25 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the six months to Sept. 30, beating forecasts for 1.15 billion euros in a Refinitiv poll, but the company remained cautious.
""For the second half of the year, volatility is likely to persist, including in terms of inflation and geopolitical tensions,"" said the company, also known for its IWC watches.
Richemont said constant currency sales jumped 65%, helped by a weak comparison base last year, when business was hit by the pandemic.

French luxury goods company LVMH said last month its like-for-like sales rose 20% in the third quarter, while Kering reported a 12.2% increase. Both flagged a slowdown in Asia due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>",Apple supplier Foxconn cautious on 2022 revenue outlook,"By Yimou Lee and Sarah Wu
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn forecast on Friday that a global chip shortage would run into the second half of 2022 and its fourth-quarter revenue for electronics, including smartphones, would fall more than 15%.
Chairman Liu Young-way said during a conference call that Foxconn was cautious about its 2022 revenue outlook, citing uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, inflation, geopolitical tensions and supply chains.
Earlier Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, reported a 20% jump in third-quarter profit.
""If not for supply shortages prospects for the fourth quarter could have been better,"" he said, adding that supply of power management chips remained tight and a global chip crunch could last longer than his previous forecast of second quarter. 
""Regarding next year's prospects, we will be relatively cautious in our outlook,"" Liu added.
A year-long shortage of chips, initially due to sky-rocketing demand for smartphones and personal gadgets during the pandemic, spilled into the auto industry and disrupted production at companies ranging from Apple to GM. 
Foxconn previously said it felt only a small impact from the crisis but had cautioned that rising COVID-19 cases in Asia could hurt its supply chain.
As well as forecasting the slide in revenue in its consumer electronics business, which includes smartphones, Foxconn said it expected overall fourth-quarter revenue to fall between 3% and 15% in the period. Analysts predicted an 11% drop, according to a Refinitiv consensus estimate.
Still, Foxconn said it expected supply shortages in Southeast Asia to ease this month and the next.
The outlook came after a strong third quarter, in which revenue rose 9% on the year, helped by strong smartphone demand that remained stable despite the supply problems.
Net profit jumped to T$36.98 billion ($1.33 billion), beating a Refinitiv consensus estimate of T$31.73 billion.
Analysts had said they expected robust iPhone sales boosted Foxconn's business in the third quarter, and the company secured more than 75% of assembly orders, including those for the latest iPhone 13. But they cautioned that supply chain problems could mute any further near-term increase in orders at Foxconn.
Apple said last month that supply chain woes cost it $6 billion in sales in the July-September quarter, and that this would worsen during the year-end holiday period.
Foxconn said it expects its electronic vehicle (EV) business to make a contribution to revenue in the third quarter of 2022, when it could start production in America in a partnership with Lordstown Motors Corp at the soonest. 
Liu said he was looking to build more EV partnerships with companies in places including the Middle East, India and Europe to ""serve the local markets"", but did not elaborate. 
Foxconn has in recent months deepened its efforts to become a major player in EVs, including announcing deals to build cars with U.S. startup Fisker Inc.

Shares in Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, closed 1.4% higher ahead of the earnings release, versus a 0.4% gain in the broader market.

""In the present circumstances, it may be a temptation too hard to resist for companies to try to play governments out against one another, scanning the landscape to see who will pay more - the risk, of course, is letting taxpayers, whether European or American, pick up the bill and getting maybe very little from that investment,"" she continued.

SMFG, Japan's second-largest bank by assets, said net profit jumped 69% to 456 billion yen ($4 billion) in the April-September period. Mizuho, the No. 3 lender, said earnings rose 79% to 385.7 billion yen. Both banks lifted full-year profit forecasts.
As the COVID-19 crisis hammered the economy, lenders have been proactive in setting aside bad loan reserves, but intervention from the government has capped those losses, said S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings senior director Ryoji Yoshizawa.
""Most of the banks have not recorded a large amount of credit costs thanks to the huge government support provided to corporate sectors,"" he said. 
Going forward, overseas lending margins may be squeezed as the Federal Reserve starts to taper its financial easing, while sluggish recoveries in Southeast Asia could add to credit costs in those markets, he added.
SMFG estimates credit-related costs will total 300 billion yen for the full financial year. For the first six months, it booked 26.7 billion yen in such costs. Mizuho is expecting 100 billion yen in credit costs for the year, and recorded 49.6 billion yen in the first half.
Japanese banks have been struggling with years of ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking population. SMFG is looking overseas for growth opportunities. 
In July, the company announced plans to buy a controlling stake in Fullerton India for $2 billion and to purchase nearly 5% of Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc shares for $386 million.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Japan Senior Credit Analyst Tetsuya Yamamoto said SMFG's profitability is likely to improve due to ""lower credit costs, higher profits from its aircraft leasing business and overseas operations in Asia, and additional cost reductions.""
SMFG also announced it would spend up to 100 billion yen to buy back and retire outstanding shares.
Mizuho has been plagued this year by a series of system glitches in its ATM network. Chief Executive Officer Tatsufumi Sakai started his earnings presentation by apologising for the trouble.
Amidst a number of earnings on Friday, a takeover drama over smaller lender Shinsei Bank Ltd escalated.
SBI Holdings Inc. said it would consider taking a majority stake in Shinsei if it succeeds in its $1.1 billion tender offer to raise its stake in the lender to 48% from about 20%.
However, SBI will retract its offer if Shinsei pursues a poison pill defence, it said.

Adding to the fray, a regulatory filing showed that City Index Eleventh, a fund backed by activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami, held 5.29% of Shinsei.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Friday, searching for direction following the sharp rise in U.S. inflation yet generally positive corporate earnings.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, climbing to a new record high, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%.
The main European indices look set to post a positive week, helped by the overall strength of the quarterly earnings season in Europe and despite a surprisingly strong reading on U.S. inflation, which raised the possibility of the Federal Reserve bringing forward plans to lift interest rates.  
The U.S. consumer price index rose 6.2% year-on-year in October, official data showed on Wednesday, the strongest advance since November 1990.
Helping the tone were gains in Asia overnight, aided by signs of consumer confidence as Chinese e-commerce giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com set new sales records across their platforms on Singles Day, the world's largest shopping event.
Back in Europe, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) stock rose 1.6% after reporting core profit above market estimates, raising its full-year outlook for the third time, boosted by its U.S. unit T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), along with growth in European business.
 Richemont  (SIX:CFR) stock soared 8.4% after the Swiss luxury goods group reported a healthy jump in its net profit in the first half of its fiscal year, and outlined plans to revamp its loss-making Yoox-Net-a-Porter business.
Hapag Lloyd (DE:HLAG) stock rose 4.7% after the German container shipping line reported a more than 10-fold surge in nine-month net profit. 
On the flip side, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock fell 2.4% despite the drugmaker expecting its Covid-19 vaccine to move to ""modest profitability"" on new orders after posting $1.05 billion in vaccine sales for the third quarter. The company has said will not make a profit from the drug during the pandemic.
The European economic calendar centers around Eurozone industrial production data for September, while the U.K. and the European Union are due to enter new negotiations over trade arrangements in Northern Ireland, in an attempt to avoid a potential trade war.
Crude prices weakened Friday, weighed by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar which makes the commodity more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.
The release of the Baker Hughes rig count and CFTC positioning data round off a volatile week in the oil market, while eyes will also be on Glasgow as the U.N. climate summit enters its final day. 
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $80.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.8% to $82.19. Both contracts are on course to record losses of around 0.7% this week.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,855.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely unchanged at 1.1451.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Explainer-China's embattled developer Kaisa Group and the chairman behind it,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - After cash-strapped developer China Evergrande https://www.reuters.com/business/several-bondholders-china-evergrande-receive-overdue-bond-coupon-payments-media-2021-11-11 Group once again averted a destabilising default this week, investor focus is shifting to other Chinese developers with offshore payments coming due, especially Kaisa Group.
Kaisa has more than $59 million in interest payments due on Thursday and Friday, with 30-day grace periods for both. It was not immediately known if Kaisa, which has already missed https://www.reuters.com/business/chinese-developer-kaisa-plunges-poor-oct-sales-add-liquidity-worries-2021-11-04 payments on some wealth management products at home, has made the dollar-bond coupon payments.
Here are key facts about the developer and its founder:
WHAT IS KAISA GROUP?
The company was founded by Kwok Ying Shing, now 57, in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in 1999. 
In 2015, Kaisa became China's first real estate company to default on an overseas bond. It bounced by 2017 and is now China's No. 25 developer by sales, with projects in 51 cities across the country, focusing on the Greater Bay Area of Hong Kong, Macau and China's Guangdong province. 
Kaisa has the most offshore bonds - $10.9 billion at the end of June - of any Chinese developer after Evergrande.
Dubbed the ""King of Urban Renewal"" by Chinese media, Kaisa has some 200 urban renewal projects across China, generating over one-third of the group's revenue, with 120 in home-base Shenzhen, where land is scarce and home prices among the highest in the country. 
In the first six months of the year, Kaisa's contracted sales climbed 77% from the same period last year to 63.9 billion yuan ($9.99 billion). Borrowings grew 2% from the end of last year to 123.8 billion yuan and assets rose 3% to 319 billion yuan.
Kaisa shares, which have plunged more than 70% this year as the debt crisis among China's developers has grown, were halted on Nov. 5. It has a market value of HK$7.09 billion ($1 billion).
WHO IS CHAIRMAN KWOK?
He was born in Chaozhou, some 300 km (180 miles) northeast of Hong Kong in Guangdong. Little is known about Kwok's education or work history, but he amassed enough money to found Kaisa at the age of 35. 
He and his two younger brothers worked in trading and industrial businesses before entering real estate, according to Chinese media. The younger of the brothers, Kwok Chun Wai, is chairman of Hong Kong brokerage Fulbright Financial Group.
The Kaisa chairman and founder is strict with his staff but is reasonable, and he maintains high standards for himself, one former and two current employees told Reuters.
Kwok is an excellent swimmer, a former employee said. Kaisa has operated sports stadiums and bought the Shenzhen Football Club in 2016, hiring stars Clarence Seedorf from Netherlands and Sweden's Sven-Goran Eriksson as head coach for a short period. 
SHENZHEN AND HONG KONG
Kwok is believed to have good connections in Shenzhen thanks to his involvement in many urban renewal projects that other developers tend to avoid, despite high profit margins.
These projects require redevelopment expertise and entail long four- to 12-year conversion times and layers of government approvals that can mean political risks.
After former senior Shenzhen official Jiang Zunyu was arrested for corruption in 2014, authorities blocked sales of most of Kaisa's Shenzhen projects with little explanation, drying up its cashflow.
Courts froze the company's assets nationwide at the request of its lenders, leading to default the next year.
In recent years Kwok has lived mostly in Hong Kong, where Kaisa is listed, said two people with knowledge of his whereabouts. He became more active in investing in the former British colony last year. 
Kaisa paid more than $1 billion for four residential sites in the city. It bought a controlling 28% stake in newspaper Sing Tao News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) for $48 million via Kwok's daughter Kwok Hiu Ting, the vice chairwoman of property management unit Kaisa Prosperity.
WHAT ELSE DOES KAISA DO?
With units listed in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and New York, Kaisa operates businesses from medical services and tech to tourism and marine transport, together contributing around 5% to the group's revenues. 
Kaisa Health Group focuses on dental prosthetics, healthcare and sports rehabilitation and has sales and service networks in more than 20 countries, including the United States and Germany, according to its website.

As of 0703 GMT, the Hong Kong-listed company was up 12.25% at HK$2.84, compared with a 0.2% rise in the broader market. The stock has lost 80% so far this year.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are dollar bonds.
The latest payments were made at the end of a 30-day grace period that ended on Wednesday, and were the third time in the past month the company has paid up perilously close to a deadline. The bonds had a total of more than $148 million due. 

Evergrande has yet to pay the coupons of offshore bonds issued by unit Scenery Journey due on Nov. 6 worth a combined $82.49 million, which also have a 30-day grace period. It also has coupon payments totalling more than $255 million due on Dec. 28. 
Bankers and analysts told Reuters that Beijing would stand firm on policies to curb excess borrowing by property developers even as it makes financing tweaks amid an industry liquidity crunch.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Stuck behind the curve,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus.
The U.N. climate summit in Glasgow is coming to an end and so far, it hasn't proven to be a game changer. 
Under countries' current pledges, global warming will most likely rise well above 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and unleash catastrophic sea level rises, floods and droughts.
While world leaders seem stuck behind the curve on climate change, many investors are also wondering whether the global economy isn't sleepwalking into an era of high inflation. 
With U.S. inflation at its highest in three decades, the U.S. Federal Reserve is still miles away from a interest rate hike. And yes it will soon start phasing out monetary stimulus, but the Fed is still buying billions of securities monthly. 
In the meantime, U.S. 10-year real rates -- the nominal rate minus headline inflation -- is nearing -5%, a level only seasoned traders came across in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Some investors see cracks in the Fed's ""transitory"" inflation narrative -- one they are no longer inclined to buy into. 
In Europe, a Reuters poll of economists showed euro zone inflation expectations are at risk of continuing to overshoot the European Central Bank's 2% target next year.
While the initial shock of Wednesday's U.S. inflation data seems to be fading, the dollar currently stands at 16-month high and 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield are about 15 basis points higher than the 1.41% it priced two days ago.
Still, MSCI's all-country world index remains within striking distance of its all-time high hit earlier this week. European and Wall Street futures are broadly flat and currently pointing to a subdued session ahead. 
One interesting development for stock markets is Japan's Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) outlining plans to spin off two core businesses -- a decision that follows a similar move by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s to split into three public companies. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday: 
- Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) core profit beats estimates; full-year outlook raised 
-AstraZeneca makes over $1 bln in Q3 vaccine sales, small profit 

-Euro zone industrial output due 
-U.S. Uni of Michigan sentiment, conditions and inflation expectations/JOLTS job openings

The world's fifth biggest operator said net profit climbed to 5.6 billion euros ($6.41 billion) in the January-September period, from 538 million euros a year earlier.
It expects earnings momentum to remain at a high level for the rest of the year while operators and customers across the globe will face more severe infrastructure bottlenecks due to the coronavirus crisis which has disrupted supply chains.
Global supply chains are under enormous pressure from delays due to logjams at ports.
Chief Executive Officer Rolf Habben Jansen told Reuters he expected some relaxation of the situation around the Chinese New Year festivities around Feb. 1 and up to the end of the second quarter.
""But with the pandemic not behind us, 2022 will not be a normal year,"" he said.
Hapag-Lloyd held on to its recently revised full-year guidance for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) between 10.1 billion and 10.9 billion euros and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between 8.7 billion and 9.5 billion euros.
Revenues in the first nine months increased by 60% to 15 billion euros, mainly due to a 66% jump in average freight rates to $1,818 per 20-foot equivalent standard container units (TEU).
Transport costs over the January to September period rose 16% to 7.4 billion euros, with shipping fuel up 12.4% at $452 a tonne.
EBITDA was 6.8 billion euros, up from 1.8 billion euros in the same period in 2020, while EBIT rose to 5.8 billion euros from 858 million euros.

The company said in August it expected to pay a healthy dividend for 2021. It will hold a capital markets day for investors on Nov. 17 and report its final 2021 earnings on March 16.

Chiang, a former research director at Taiwan's TSMC, joined SMIC in late December. The company said he had resigned from his vice-chairman position as well as from the board with effect from Thursday in order to spend more time with his family. 
His departure comes just two months after SMIC's chairman, Zhou Zixue, also resigned, citing health reasons. 
Besides Chiang, three other members resigned from the board, including co-chief executive officer Liang Mong Song, who had threatened to quit https://www.reuters.com/article/china-smic-idCNL1N2IW04F in December last year. He would remain in his executive role, SMIC said. 
The resignations were not due to any disagreements with the board and the company did not expect the moves to have a material impact on its operations, it said. 
SMIC, China's largest contract chipmaker which is partly backed by a state-affiliated chip fund, is at the forefront of China's charge to catch up with Japan, South Korea and the United States in chip technology.
The company is on a U.S. blacklist that denies it advanced manufacturing equipment from U.S. suppliers due to its alleged ties to China's military, claims SMIC rejects.
The measures disrupted the company's plans to move into high-end chip making, but its financial performance has been strong as a global chip shortage has boosted demand.

Its third-quarter profit rose 22.6%.
On Friday, it said it had registered a joint venture company for a $8.87 billion deal it has to build a chip plant in Shanghai. It first announced the capacity expansion plan in early September.

Express delivery accounted for 24% of the total number of orders.
In the first nine months of this year, GMV reached 36.2 billion roubles, which is three times higher than in the same period a year ago.

Last month, AliExpress Russia, an e-commerce venture between Chinese online shopping giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Russian partners, reported GMV of 133.3 billion roubles for the first half of the 2021-22 financial year, up 36% year-on-year.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 01:00AM ET</span>",Ping An seeks to sell $2.1 billion stake in Autohome -sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Financial conglomerate Ping An Insurance Group of China is seeking to offload its 44% stake in auto services portal Autohome, three people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
Ping An, which is currently the biggest shareholder of Beijing-based Autohome via an offshore entity, has held talks with several strategic and private equity investors for the stake in recent months, said the people. 
The stake would be worth around $2.15 billion based on Authome's current valuation.
Autohome faces growing difficulties in China where automakers, in particular electric vehicle (EV) makers, increasingly rely on their own distribution networks instead of dealerships for sales, said two of the people. 
That has affected the business of many dealers in the world's biggest auto market and then forced them to cut budgets for online portals like Autohome, said the people. 
Founded in 2005, Autohome mainly serves as an information portal for automobile buyers and an online car-trading marketplace in China. 
Advertisements and fees from automakers and dealers generally account for more than 80% of its revenue as they use its platform for services including brand and sales promotions.
Ping An, China's largest insurer by market value, declined to comment on ""market rumours"". Autohome, which is listed in both New York and Hong Kong, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Autohome's U.S.-listed stock was down more than 70% Thursday from this year's peak of $147.7 in January. It went public in Hong Kong in March with lukewarm interest and its share price has fallen more than 60% from a peak of HK$199.60 in March. 
Australian telecom giant Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) sold its 47.4% stake in Autohome to Ping An in 2016 for $1.6 billion, saying Autohome would benefit from the Ping An's expertise in car insurance and financing as it moved away from being purely online and began offline sales in China. 
Ping An's insurance business and investment returns have been hit by weakness in China's economy, which posted its slowest growth in a year in the third quarter as power shortages and property sector worries took a toll. 
The insurer reported a 31.2% fall in third-quarter net profit due to lower premium income and losses on investment assets. 
Ping An had reached out to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) for the stake sale, said two of the sources. The internet and gaming giant owns Bitauto, an online platform similar to Autohome. 
However, Tencent did not deem the deal viable due to antitrust concerns, said one of them. 
Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Autohome reported $300 million of net revenue and $116 million of net income for the second quarter this year, down 16% and 9% respectively year-on-year. 
It has 64 million monthly active users on its mobile phone app and 45 million daily active users on its web portal, according to its website.

However, SBI will retract its offer if Shinsei Bank pursues a poison pill defence, the online financial conglomerate said in a statement in response to questions from Shinsei shareholder Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan.
Shinsei opposed SBI's approach last month, saying that the offer could hurt interests of minority shareholders and that the price was too low.
Its possible poison pill defence - in which a company dilutes the value of its shares or takes other action to make itself an unattractive target - has won the support of proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co.
SBI on Friday said such support ""lacks sufficient logic"".

It also said that if it retracts its tender offer, it would consider other options, including selling all of its stake in Shinsei Bank.
SBI shares were up 1.7% in afternoon trade, whereas those of Shinsei Bank were flat. The broader Nikkei index was up 1%.

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd said on Friday that sales during its annual Singles' Day shopping frenzy grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever, underscoring strong regulatory and supply chain headwinds for China's tech firms.
The Chinese e-commerce juggernaut said sales, or ""gross merchandise value"" (GMV), over its 11-day Singles' Day event that ended on Thursday rose to 540.3 billion yuan ($84.5 billion), compared with 26% growth last year.
Sales had grown by double digits every year since Alibaba founded the festival in 2009 and built it into the world's biggest online sales fest, dwarfing Cyber Monday in the United States. It changed the gala to a multi-day event last year.
The results come as overall consumption in China slows ad cap a relatively muted version of a sales festival that Alibaba once aggressively promoted.
Before the sales period began, analysts had said they expected Alibaba to report only a minor increase in GMV this year, citing slowing retail sales, supply shortages, power disruptions and COVID-19 lockdowns. 
The festival, which Alibaba last year stretched to a 11-day event with the best deals concentrated in two discount periods, Nov. 1-3 and Nov. 11, has become a closely watched gauge of consumer sentiment in the world's second-largest economy. 
This year, Alibaba played down its sales figures and touted its social welfare initiatives in the final hours of its Singles' Day festival on Thursday, marking a shift in tone for the highly-publicized event.
Eschewing a rolling tally tracking transactions that had taken centre stage in previous years, Alibaba urged viewers of a three-hour livestream to click ""like"" and help raise 1 million yuan ($156,359.90) for a 200-acre (81-hectare) elephant reserve in China's rural southwest.
The e-commerce giant has toned down the marketing hype amid ongoing regulatory tightening from Chinese authorities, saying its focus was on sustainable growth this year. 
In previous years, Alibaba would tout Chinese consumers' demand for washing machines, smartphones, and makeup with a night-long presentation of statistics. But this year it used its gala to highlight initiatives such as a program that assists disabled individuals in buying apparel and efforts to use more environmentally-friendly packaging.
Still, the event remains a top draw for millions of merchants and shoppers, with flashy deals and live-streamers hawking products from skincare products to sports shoes on Alibaba's platforms, including its Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.
Alibaba said that nearly 400 brands, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and L'Oreal SA, have raked in more than $15 million in sales each by mid-day on Thursday. 
The shopping event comes after a year of ongoing regulatory tightening from Chinese authorities in several industries, during which Alibaba was a frequent target. 
The e-commerce giant was fined a record $2.8 billion for monopolistic behaviour in April and its founder, Jack Ma, China's highest-profile entrepreneur, has retreated from public view after criticising Chinese regulators a year ago.

On Wednesday, its rival Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) posted its slowest revenue growth since it went public in 2004, hurt by a regulatory crackdown.

The aim is to use the available renewable energy to power electrolysers to split water and produce so-called green hydrogen which would then be converted to ammonia for export, part of a push by Australia, a major coal and gas exporter, to help cut carbon emissions.
Woodside is working with Japan's Marubeni Corp and IHI Corp to export 200,000 tonnes a year of green ammonia to Japan from Tasmania's Bell Bay area, starting with 300 megawatts of electrolyser capacity.
They aim to make a final investment decision in 2023 and complete construction in 2025 on the project called H2TAS. Woodside has not disclosed a cost for the project yet.
""H2TAS is already garnering interest from existing and prospective Woodside customers in Asia and Europe,"" Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said in a statement.
Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) and Origin Energy have proposed similar projects at Bell Bay.
Tasmania's Energy Minister Guy Barnett said the state was working closely with the projects to create a single export hub, which could qualify for funding from the Australian government's A$464 million ($338 million) clean hydrogen hubs program. First round bids close on Nov. 22.
""Woodside strongly supports a collaborative approach among proponents and with governments to strengthen Bell Bay as a hub,"" Woodside spokesperson Christine Forster said in emailed comments, adding that sharing infrastructure would help keep costs down.

Government support would be needed for its H2TAS project, the company said.

(Reuters) -A new version of a lawsuit accusing Subway of deceiving the public about its tuna products said lab testing shows they contain animal proteins such as chicken, pork and cattle, and not the advertised ""100% tuna.""
Karen Dhanowa and Nilima Amin filed a third version of their proposed class action this week in the federal court in San Francisco, near their homes in Alameda County.
Subway said in a statement it will seek to dismiss the ""reckless and improper"" lawsuit.
The chain said the plaintiffs have ""filed three meritless complaints, changing their story each time,"" and that its ""high-quality, wild-caught, 100% tuna"" was regulated strictly in the United States and around the world.
Since the case began in January, Subway has run TV ads and launched a website https://www.subway.com/en-us/tunafacts defending its tuna. It also revamped its menu but not its tuna, saying an upgrade wasn't needed https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/subway-time-end-outrageous-lawsuit-over-its-tuna-2021-07-26.
The original complaint claimed that Subway tuna salads, sandwiches and wraps were ""bereft"" of tuna, while an amended complaint said they were not 100% sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar dismissed the second version last month, saying the plaintiffs did not show they bought Subway tuna based on alleged misrepresentations.
He did not rule on the merits, and gave the plaintiffs another chance to make their case.
The Nov. 8 lawsuit relies on testing by a marine biologist of 20 tuna samples taken from 20 Subway restaurants in southern California.
It said 19 samples had ""no detectable tuna DNA sequences,"" while all 20 contained detectable chicken DNA, 11 contained pork DNA and 7 contained cattle DNA.
Many people cannot eat various meats because of diet or religious issues.
The complaint said the testing showed that Subway mislabeled its tuna products, and ""duped"" consumers into paying premium prices.
Amin said she ordered Subway tuna products more than 100 times from 2013 to 2019, and always checked the menu to ensure she would be eating ""only tuna.""

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and violations of California consumer protection laws.

""We have 92% of pilots and 86% of cabin crew now back with us,"" he told analysts and media. ""At the level we are operating now, which is 37% of pre-COVID capacity, going up to 43% in December, we are quite comfortable with this return rate.""
The airline said on Thursday market conditions were improving after it reported a narrower second-quarter loss due to cost-cutting efforts, record cargo revenue and an improvement in passenger numbers from a low base.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday signed legislation to prevent companies like Huawei Technologies Co or ZTE Corp (HK:0763) that are deemed security threats from receiving new equipment licenses from U.S. regulators.
The Secure Equipment Act, the latest effort by the U.S. government to crack down on Chinese telecom and tech companies, was approved unanimously by the U.S. Senate on Oct. 28 and earlier in the month by the U.S. House on a 420-4 vote.
The signing comes days before Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to hold a virtual summit. Reuters reported the meeting is expected Monday, amid tensions over trade, human rights and military activities.
The new law requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to no longer review or approve any authorization application for equipment that poses an unacceptable risk to national security.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the commission has approved more than 3,000 applications from Huawei since 2018. The law ""will help to ensure that insecure gear from companies like Huawei and ZTE can no longer be inserted into America’s communications networks,"" Carr said.
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks.
The named companies included previously designated Huawei and ZTE, as well as Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. 
The FCC in June voted unanimously to advance a plan to ban approvals for equipment in U.S. telecommunications networks from those Chinese companies even as lawmakers pursued legislation to mandate it.
The FCC vote in June drew opposition from Beijing.
""The United States, without any evidence, still abuses national security and state power to suppress Chinese companies,"" Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson at China's foreign ministry, said in June.
Under proposed rules that won initial approval in June, the FCC could also revoke prior equipment authorizations issued to Chinese companies.

Huawei in June called the proposed FCC revision ""misguided and unnecessarily punitive.""
Last month, the FCC voted to revoke the authorization for China Telecom (NYSE:CHA)'s U.S. subsidiary to operate in the United States, citing national security concerns.

WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) -An independent court-appointed monitor, named to oversee the United Auto Workers union after a federal corruption probe, said on Thursday the union has ""fallen short"" in its reform efforts and disclosed he has 15 open investigations.
Neil Barofsky, a former federal prosecutor, said in his first report the UAW must ""take more affirmative measures to fully eradicate the strong remnants of the 'toxic' culture that characterized its recent past and still remain present today.""
The union agreed to the oversight as part of a settlement with federal prosecutors in December. In total, 16 people have been convicted in the wide-ranging union corruption probe.
Several UAW officers, including two former UAW presidents, have pleaded guilty to embezzling millions of dollars for their personal benefit, using the funds for liquor, cigars, golf outings, related equipment and expensive hotel stays.
Barofsky said the UAW has not done ""enough to respond to repeated warnings about the pressing need to transform its culture."" He added he ""currently has 15 open investigations.""
The UAW represents about 400,000 U.S. workers, including workers at Detroit’s Big Three automakers and in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of some 1.5 million. 
Barofsky did not provide details on the open investigations. Under the Justice Department consent decree, he has authority to exercise disciplinary powers within the UAW, investigate possible fraud or corruption within the union and seek discipline against UAW officers and members.
The monitor can investigate, audit and review all aspects of the UAW other than collective bargaining agreements.
Barofsky added that his findings ""should not take away from the meaningful changes that have occurred since the government started putting former UAW officials in prison."" 
The UAW did not comment Thursday, but in an email President Ray Curry said to members: ""We continue to be committed to transparency and the substantive and ongoing Ethics Reforms package that has been instituted over the past two years.""
""The UAW continues to work cooperatively and effectively with the monitor on the implementation and development of even more checks and balances for our union"" and ""there are always growing pains and adjustments to new policies,"" he said.
The report's release comes ahead of a visit next week by President Joe Biden of a GM plant that is staffed by UAW members. Biden has worked to establish a strong relationship with the union and backed tax incentives for union-made vehicles
This week, U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged the financial secretary-treasurer of UAW Local 412 with embezzling over $2 million in union funds. 
Barofsky's oversight of the UAW, which began in May, is scheduled to last six years, with a potential early termination or extension depending on the circumstances.
Barofsky also disclosed that he closed an investigation into allegations Curry in 2017 accepted use of football tickets the UAW had obtained in a vendor contract. Barofsky determined not to bring charges and instead referred the matter to the union’s ethics officer.

Curry said in the email he had voluntarily repaid the value of the tickets. ""Despite this ruling, I am personally pained that any question whatsoever was raised as a result of any action on my part,"" he added.
Curry said the union has established a new ethics hotline, hired a new external ethics officer and ethics ombudsman.

The electric-car maker's stock ended the session down 0.4% at $1,063.51 after tumbling earlier in the week.
Musk's share sale was his first since 2016 and comes after his weekend poll of Twitter users about offloading 10% of his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stake, which comprises most of his estimated $281 billion fortune. 
""I don't think investors are reading in to the news negatively,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser at Wealthspire Advisors in New York. ""If you believe in the Tesla story, this should not impact you or change your mind."" 
Tesla's stock is in portfolios utilized by Wealthspire, Pursche said.
Filings showed Musk's trust sold nearly 3.6 million shares of Tesla, worth around $4 billion, while he also sold another 934,000 shares for $1.1 billion to cover tax obligations after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares.
The sale equates to about 3% of Musk's total holdings. The options-related part of the sale was put in place in September, well before his Twitter poll.
Before the sale, Musk owned a 23% stake in Tesla, including stock options. He also owns other companies including SpaceX.
Musk's move to sell his Tesla shares comes as U.S. Senate Democrats propose taxing the stock holdings of billionaires to help finance President Joe Biden's social spending plan.
""Elon Musk doesn't take a salary, he's paid in big chunks of stock. At some point in time you have to take some of that concentration down,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""This is not novel. It just gets more attention because it's such a high market-cap type, attention-grabbing kind of company.""
With nearly 800,000 options, or about 12% of Tesla's open contracts, set to expire at the close of trading on Friday, some analysts have pointed to the potential for additional near-term volatility as investors and options dealers make adjustments to account for expiring positions.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
EV MANIA 
Tesla this week has lost $157 billion in stock market value, more than the combined market capitalizations of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). At the same time, demand for shares of electric vehicle makers has heated up.
Shares of Rivian Automotive Inc jumped 22% a day after a stellar market debut that sent the company's valuation over $100 billion. Lucid Group surged 10%.
Underscoring retail investors' thirst for EV stocks, Rivian, Tesla and Lucid made up three of the four most-traded stocks on Fidelity's brokerage website on Thursday, with buy orders outnumbering sell orders.
Wall Street's biggest institutional investors, including T. Rowe Price and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), are betting on Rivian to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla, amid mounting pressure on automakers in China and Europe to eliminate vehicle emissions.
""Rivian’s valuation makes it a legitimate option for institutional investors who have previously only had Tesla to play the electric vehicle space,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a recent note. 

Four former and current Tesla board members, including Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, have filed to sell nearly $1 billion worth of shares since Tesla's market value surpassed $1 trillion late last month, according to filings and market data.
Tesla's share price has made staggering gains over recent years and has epitomized the ebullient mood in U.S. markets and the optimism of small-time traders who have helped drive it up 51% this year and 1,300% from 2020 lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended only nominally higher on Thursday, with chipmakers helping push the Nasdaq into green territory in a muted Veterans Day session, the day after hotter-than-expected inflation reports dampened investor sentiment and halted a streak of record closing highs.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, falling in the wake of a disappointing earnings report, dragged the Dow into the red.
The bond market was closed in observance of Veterans Day, and in the absence of economic data and with third-quarter earnings season winding down, there were few catalysts to move markets in either direction.
""Days like today are really hard to judge because you essentially have half the market closed,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""Specific company and industry events are driving today’s markets.""
""There will be a lot more trading tomorrow than today, so we’ll have to wait and see what will happen,"" Tuz added.
Investors were favoring growth over value, and economically sensitive smallcaps and chips were outperforming the broader market.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index gained 1.9%, bouncing back from its worst session in more than six weeks, driven by gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp after brokerage Susquehanna raised the chipmaker's price target.
Market participants were digesting recent inflation data, which suggested that the current wave of price spikes due to chronic worldwide supply challenges could have more staying power than many - including the U.S. Federal Reserve - had hoped.
With consumer sentiment data expected tomorrow and a string of retailers due to report quarterly earnings over the next few weeks, focus is shifting to consumer spending as the holiday shopping season approaches.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158.71 points, or 0.44%, to 35,921.23, the S&P 500 gained 2.56 points, or 0.06%, to 4,649.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.58 points, or 0.52%, to 15,704.28.
Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, six closed higher, with materials leading the gainers. Utilities suffered the largest percentage loss.
Shares of Walt Disney Co sank 7.1% and were the heaviest drag on the Dow following its disappointing earnings release, in which the media company reported shortfalls in streaming subscribers and theme park revenues.
Electric automaker Rivian Automotive Inc's shares jumped 22.1% a day after closing 29.1% above its offer price in its debut as a publicly traded company.
Rival Lucid Group Inc's shares surged by 10.4%.
But Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc slipped 0.4% following news that CEO Elon Musk sold about $5 billion of the stock in the company over the last few days, following his infamous Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll on whether he should shed 10% of his shares in the firm he founded.
Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) Inc gained 10.0% after handily beating quarterly earnings and revenue forecasts. Fellow department stores Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN), which have yet to report quarterly results, rose between 2% and 3.6%.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc gained 8.4% after the luxury fashion accessories firm boosted its annual sales forecast and announced a $1 billion share buyback plan.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 114 new highs and 125 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.61 billion shares, compared with the 10.91 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The revised offer was set to expire Thursday midnight and the company said no further negotiations were scheduled.
About 1,400 workers across the four cereal plants have been on strike since Oct.5, and the company has warned of a hit to earnings if it prolongs. 
Kellogg had demanded that workers give up quality health care, retirement benefits, and holiday and vacation pay, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) International Union had said at the start of the strike. 
BCTGM was not immediately available for comment. 
Kellogg said it had sought a temporary restraining order to help ensure the safety of all individuals in the vicinity of the plant, including that of the picketers.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -The death toll in the Astroworld Festival stampede rose to nine with the death of a 22-year-old Texas college student late on Wednesday, according to a lawyer for the family.
A stampede of fans during rap star Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival on Friday killed nine people between the ages of 14 and 27 and injured scores. A 9-year-old boy remains hospitalized in critical condition, police have said.
Bharti Shahani, a Texas A&M University computer science student, died from ""horrific injuries"" sustained at the rap concert, James Lassiter, a lawyer for the family, said on Thursday. She attended the concert with her sister and cousin who survived. 
""We want to make sure that the people who decided to put profits over the safety of the lives of children are held responsible,"" said Lassiter in a news conference attended by Shahani's family. 
Scott on Thursday asked victims to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid,"" according to a statement. The rapper earlier offered to pay for funeral costs and mental health counseling. 
Police are continuing to interview witnesses and are building a timeline https://www.reuters.com/world/us/timelines-major-focus-investigation-travis-scott-concert-deaths-houston-police-2021-11-10 of events leading to the deaths, Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said on Wednesday.
Mohit Bellani, Shahani's cousin who also attended the performance, said barricades hemmed in attendees and prevented them from escaping the crushing stampede.
""If they hadn't packed us in with barriers on all three sides, maybe this wouldn't have happened,"" he said. 
Authorities informed the promoter during Scott's performance that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was under way on one or more attendees and asked for the concert to be halted, Finner said. 

Scott's attorney criticized police statements as inconsistent. Houston officials should stop ""fingerpointing so that together we can identify exactly what transpired and how we can prevent anything like this from happening again,"" said attorney Edwin McPherson. 
At least 50 lawsuits have been filed against producer Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) Inc and Scott because of deaths and injuries related to Friday's concert.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Lordstown Motors Corp on Thursday delayed next year's launch of its Endurance electric pickup truck by a quarter, citing parts and materials shortages and other supply-chain issues, sending shares down 11% in after-hours trading.
The Ohio-based electric vehicle startup, while reporting its third-quarter results, said it would now begin production and deliveries in the third quarter of 2022, rather than in the second quarter that it forecast in August.
""We're focused on the Endurance. We know we have to get that truck out. It's been a challenging quarter with raw material shortages, parts shortages, supply-chain disruptions, particularly from international sourcing, but we're doing everything we can to mitigate it,"" Chief Executive Daniel Ninivaggi said on a conference call. 
He also cited delayed semiconductor shipments that have dogged the entire auto industry.
""We're going to do everything possible to get the truck out on our revised schedule,"" Ninivaggi added.
Lordstown has struggled with the launch of the Endurance and unwanted attention since a short seller in March accused the company of misleading investors.
Its previous CEO, Steve Burns, subsequently resigned. The company still faces investigations by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to vehicle pre-orders and Lordstown's deal to go public through a reverse merger with a blank-check firm.
A day after announcing it had finalized a deal for Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Co Ltd to buy Lordstown's plant in northeast Ohio for $230 million and take over production of the Endurance, Lordstown said on Thursday it also signed a memorandum of understanding with Cox Automotive.
Cox will provide fleet customer service and support for Lordstown's EVs, including maintenance, vehicle pickup and delivery, battery servicing, repairs and roadside assistance, Ninivaggi said.
Under the Foxconn deal, the companies will pursue a joint-venture agreement to develop vehicles for the global commercial fleet using Foxconn's MIH vehicle platform. Ninivaggi said on Thursday that Lordstown is working on design ideas off that platform that include a commercial van.
Ninivaggi also said wheel-mounted ""hub"" motors, which are used in the Endurance, will not be used in every vehicle the company develops.

On Thursday, Lordstown reported a third-quarter net loss of $95.8 million, or 54 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 59 cents a share.
Company executives said they are not providing a financial forecast for 2022 at this time, and Lordstown is expected to end the year with cash balances between $150 million and $180 million, including the expected initial payment of $100 million from Foxconn.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will visit a Michigan General Motors (NYSE:GM) electric vehicle plant next week as the White House pushes Congress to approve big tax incentives for zero-emission vehicles. 
The largest U.S. automaker said its ""Factory Zero"" will mark its grand opening during Biden's visit Wednesday. The plant, spanning parts of Detroit and Hamtramck, actually opened in 1985 but GM said in 2020 it would repurpose it to build electric trucks and SUVs.
Biden will discuss $7.5 billion in funding for EV charging stations in a recently approved infrastructure bill, as well as how EVs will reduce emissions, improve air quality and create ""good-paying, union jobs across the country,"" the White House said.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra will attend Wednesday's event.
In August, Biden signed an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. The 50% target, which is not legally binding and includes plug-in hybrid models with gasoline engines, won backing of U.S. and foreign automakers, which said achieving it would require billions of dollars in government funding.
A proposed $1.75 trillion social spending and climate bill includes an EV tax credit of up to $12,500, including a $4,500 incentive for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Cost of the tax credit is estimated at $9.6 billion over 10 years.
It also includes new EV used car tax credits, $3.5 billion in grants for automakers to convert existing plants to electric vehicles and components and $9 billion for the U.S. government and Postal Service to buy EVs and charging infrastructure.
On Thursday, key Democratic Senator Joe Manchin expressed opposition https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-investing-240-million-west-virginia-build-hybrid-parts-2021-11-11 to the union EV provision.
Biden has repeatedly refused to back any specific date to phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles. The United States did not join https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/six-major-carmakers-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2040-uk-says-2021-11-10 some other countries in Glasgow in backing a phase-out by 2040.
The EV tax credits would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co
and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a leg up.
The Democratic proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would again make GM eligible, along with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing U.S. factory workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.

GM in 2020 said it was renaming its Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant ""Factory Zero"" as it announced a $2.2 billion investment to shift the factory to EVs. The GM plant has built more than 4 million vehicles.
In September, Detroit won a $4 million https://eda.gov/news/press-releases/2021/09/23/detroit-mi.htm U.S. Commerce Department grant to reconstruct deteriorating roads in support of Factory Zero.

Let’s discuss.For the first half of this year, initial public offerings (IPOs) hit record highs, totaling $171 billion and surpassing the IPO boom of 2020.

Frontier markets investment bank Renaissance Capital anticipates the year will end with 400 traditional IPOs and 600 SPACs.
However, investing in IPOs can be risky due to a lack of historical data on some companies listing the stock for the first time.

The central bank’s bond-buying is expected to decline by $15 billion each month. In addition, supply chain worries persist, driving high and persistent inflation concerns. These factors could adversely impact the performance of many recently listed stocks.
Recently listed stocks Amplitude, Inc. (AMPL), Dutch Bros Inc. (BROS), and Tyra Biosciences, Inc. (TYRA) look overvalued at their current price levels. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 04:27PM ET</span>","‘December to Forget’: Automakers, retailers cut TV ads amid supply chain woes","By Joseph White, Sheila Dang and Arriana McLymore
DETROIT (Reuters) - For years, luxury vehicle brands have promoted holiday season sales with slogans like Lexus's ""A December to remember.""
But automakers and dealers are on track to spend less on advertising this holiday season, industry executives and analysts said, leaving behind the generous lease deals and discounts of seasons past. A year of supply chain and production disruptions have left auto dealerships with roughly one-third of the normal inventory levels, giving sellers little reason to shell out for splashy holiday ads.
""We will not be promoting the holiday season as we have been,"" said Rory Harvey, vice president of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cadillac brand. With the supply of vehicles at a third of normal levels, he said, ""why would you?"" 
In 2019, General Motors spent an estimated $106 million on TV commercials for Cadillac and $16.4 million on digital ads for the brand, according to estimates from ad measurement and analytic firms EDO and Pathmatics. 
Automakers are not alone. Global supply chain disruptions are prompting inventory issues across multiple categories including electronics, toys and apparel. Online shoppers saw more than 2 billion out-of-stock messages last month, more than three times the amount in October 2019, according to the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index. 
Carmakers - usually big spenders during the fourth quarter - spent about $23 million or 10% less on digital advertising between late July to the end of October when compared to the same period in 2019, according to Pathmatics, which compiled data for Reuters. The 2019 data excludes Instagram ads.
The industry also spent $57 million or 5% less on broadcast television commercials during that time frame compared with 2019, according to estimates from EDO.
“Winter sales events are such an institutionalized event, that it’s hard not to do them,” said Kevin Krim, chief executive of EDO. “But if they do their jobs really well, they could make people unhappy if the cars aren’t there. It is a December to forget for the automakers.” 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has begun a holiday campaign called ""Get Holiday Ready,"" to promote its F-series pickup and certain SUVs. Lexus is also going ahead with its annual ""December to Remember"" advertising campaign, which popularized the idea of a luxury vehicle as a holiday gift.
""For us to change it dramatically, it's too important to the brand. It's part of our DNA,"" said the brand's U.S. vice president for marketing Vinay Shahani. Lexus' spending will be ""in the ballpark"" of past years, he said.
However, Shahani said, ""certainly you could expect the offers may not be as compelling"" as two years ago. 
At the largest U.S. auto retail chain, AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN), the plan is to spend less on advertising than in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, said Executive Vice President Marc Cannon. Discount offers from automakers ""will be light all around,"" he said. 
Media companies that sell ad time for national television commercials could feel the brunt of the disruptions, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, in a research note last week. 
Nathanson said he expects the total amount spent on national TV ads to decline by 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, as car manufacturers, which continue to struggle with chip shortages, could run fewer holiday commercials, he wrote. 
That would also represent a 7% total decline in ads from 2019, in pre-COVID times, he added.
KEEPING THE ATTENTION
Looking ahead to the holidays, and beyond the car lot, some of shoppers' favorite brands may have temporary marketing blackouts, due to inventory and labor shortages. 
Department stores, including Macy's (NYSE:M) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN)'s, spent 8% less on TV commercials from July 30 to Oct. 30 compared to the same period in 2019, according to EDO estimates. 
Casual dining restaurants have slashed TV commercial spending by 56% compared to pre-COVID levels, as dine-in restaurants have struggled with fewer wait staff.
However, the supply chain disruptions have not caused data analytic firms to lower projections for total ad spending this year because brands want to maintain a customer’s attention for when products are finally available, said advertising experts who spoke with Reuters. 

Data from Pathmatics, which tracks internet display ads and digital ads on platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), shows that the top 25 advertisers in four key sectors - packaged goods, retail, electronics and gaming - doubled their spending over the past three months compared with the same period in 2020. For instance, e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) spent $304 million during the three months this year versus $176 million during the same period in 2020.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) spent $89 million versus $46 million during the same period in 2020.
Some advertisers have simply switched their messages to market products they have in stock while others merely want to keep their brand names in the front of consumers, said Bret Sanford-Chung, managing director of marketing consulting at KPMG.

Investing.com - Phunware reported a surprise third-quarter profit loss as lower costs offset a fall in revenue.
Phunware stock was up more than 11% following the news.
The company reported third quarter EPS of 1 cent on revenue of $2.2 million, compared with analysts estimates for a loss of 4 cents a share on revenue of $2.27 million.
The software maker's results also benefited from a $2.9 million gain from its PPP loan.
""We are extremely excited to post 50% sequential organic growth in net revenues quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating that we are now reaping the benefits of our direct and indirect go-to-market strategies for our MaaS enterprise cloud platform for mobile,” the company said.
Looking ahead 2022, the company said it was excited to ""have a fully funded operating plan that gives us the ability to drive organic and inorganic growth.""
""In addition to executing on our operational objectives, the company successfully raised more than $65 million and now holds approximately 129 bitcoin,"" it added.
In October, the company said it would accept bitcoin as payment for purchases of high-performance computers and peripherals provided by its Lyte Technology business unit.
Phunware has given up some its gains since its more than 1,000% surge a last month, when speculation swirled that company could be involved in building former President Donald Trump's Truth Social media platform. "

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) on Thursday made a major push to have more audiobooks on its platform by buying U.S.-based audio tech company Findaway as it tries to recreate its success with podcasts.
Findaway, which has partnerships with audiobook publishers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Audible, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iBooks, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Storytel, offers a global audio book catalog. It also owns Voices, which helps authors to self publish.
""This is the first big move...what we want to achieve is for Spotify consumers to be able to buy any audio book on Spotify and listen to it,"" Chief Research & Development Officer Gustav Söderström said in an interview. 
Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, were not disclosed. 
Spotify is following a playbook similar to that of its podcast business. It ventured into podcasts in 2018, bulked it up with a string of acquisitions and is expected by analysts to overtake Apple as the largest podcast provider by the end of the year with more than 3 million titles.
The company, which already has a tie-up with Swedish audiobook streaming group Storytel to allow its subscribers to listen to audiobooks, had also launched Open Access Platform for publishers to stream their content.
""We know from a survey that many of our users who listened to true crime podcasts also went on to buy audiobooks about true crime,"" said Söderström. ""That's a big potential for publishers, because we think we have a user base that is a really good target for audiobooks as well.""
Spotify's total monthly active users rose 19% to 381 million in the latest quarter with revenue of about 2.5 billion euros ($2.87 billion).

The global audiobooks market is expected to be worth $9.3 billion by 2026 from $4 billion in 2020, according to research firm Omdia.

So, both  Target  (TGT) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) are well-positioned to see sales growth in the coming months. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read onto find out.Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) are two prominent players in the retail industry. TGT in Minneapolis, Minn., is a general merchandise retailer that offers food assortments, apparel, accessories, home decor products, electronics, seasonal offerings, and beauty and household essentials through its stores and digital channels. As of January 30, 2021, the company operated approximately 1,897 stores. In comparison, BBBY in Union, N.J., operates a chain of retail stores that sells domestic merchandise, home furnishings, consumables, and various juvenile products internationally. It also operates Decorist, an online interior design platform that provides personalized home design services. BBBY operated 1,020 stores as of February 27, 2021.
Despite rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and a slowdown in third-quarter GDP growth, U.S. retail sales rose 0.9% year-over-year in August, 0.7% in September, and 0.9% in October. Furthermore, declining jobless claims each week, rising consumer spending, and the lifting of travel bans should continue to help retailers generate solid sales. The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts holiday retail sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% during November and December. The global retail market is expected to grow at a 7.7% CAGR to $29.45 trillion in 2025. So, both TGT and BBBY should benefit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said on Thursday he opposes a proposal in President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion social spending and climate legislation that would give union-made U.S. electric vehicles a $4,500 tax incentive.
Manchin's comments came at an event where  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it would invest $240 million in its West Virginia engine and transmission plant to build hybrid transaxles. Manchin represents the state.
His opposition was first reported by Automotive News, which quoted him as saying that the union-made vehicle incentive was ""wrong"" and ""not American."" He told the publication: ""We shouldn’t use everyone’s tax dollars to pick winners and losers.""
Toyota has been heavily lobbying against the proposed $4,500 electric vehicle tax credit for union-made vehicles.
The social spending and climate bill being considered in Congress includes up to $12,500 in tax credits for U.S.-made EVs, including the $4,500 union provision. The bill is a key pillar of Biden's domestic agenda.
Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any of the $12,500 credit.
The EV tax credits are backed by Biden, many congressional Democrats and the United Auto Workers union and would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a big leg up, while 25 ambassadors recently wrote lawmakers opposing it.
The Senate is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans and Manchin is a key voice on a number of provisions in the spending legislation.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and foreign automakers like Toyota do not have unions representing U.S. factory workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
Toyota said on Thursday that large parts of the world are not ready for zero-emission vehicles, which is why it did not sign a pledge this week to phase out fossil-fuel cars by 2040.

Six major carmakers, including GM, Ford, Sweden's Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz, signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, as did a number of countries including India.
Toyota and No. 2 global automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), as well as crucial car markets the United States, China and Germany did not.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 03:10PM ET</span>",Under-fire Telecom Italia CEO survives board showdown,"By Elvira Pollina and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) CEO Luigi Gubitosi survived a boardroom showdown on Thursday at a meeting sought by top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) following two profit warnings in three months at Italy's former phone monopoly.
Vivendi has called into question Gubitosi's role and sources close to the matter had said sparks could fly on Thursday.
TIM said its board had discussed the difficult market situation and the challenges facing the group, agreeing steps to prepare a new strategic plan due in February.
Discussions were tense, two people with knowledge of the matter said, adding Vivendi would continue to pressure the CEO to address the debt laden group's issues. 
Vivendi was not immediately available to comment.
Having failed to stem a steady revenue decline in TIM's crowded domestic market, Gubitosi has outlined to the board plans to squeeze cash out of the group's assets, including its prized fixed-line grid that supplies services to millions of Italian households and businesses.
His proposals, aimed at bringing in new investors into TIM's assets under a spin off plan, failed to get Vivendi's backing at a meeting last month, people close to the matter have said.
The French media group wants to have a bigger say over the fate of TIM's network assets, deciding in agreement with the Italian government, according to the people.
TIM also said in Thursday's statement no negotiations were ongoing over its network or other strategic assets.
Vivendi holds 24% of TIM, an investment exposing it to a potential 1.8 billion euro capital loss at current market prices.
TIM's network assets are deemed strategic by the government, and Treasury-owned CDP has built a 9.8% stake in the group to oversee them and help counter Vivendi's influence.
Both the French group and CDP in March backed Gubitosi's reappointment and CDP is for now resisting Vivendi's efforts to question his position, sources have told Reuters.
Innovation Minister Vittorio Colao, a former Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) boss tasked by Prime Minister Mario Draghi with implementing plans to boost Italy's ultra-fast connections, is expected to play a key role in deciding the future of TIM and its CEO.

Colao has poured cold water on a project championed by the Treasury under Italy's previous government to merge TIM's fixed-line access network with that of state-backed rival Open Fiber.

Investing.com —  Cortexyme Inc  (NASDAQ:CRTX) stocks are down Thursday after the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company released additional phase 2/3 data from the trial of its Alzheimer's drug atuzaginstat.
In October, the company revealed that the study didn't meet statistical significance in its co-primary endpoints.
However, it told investors today that it ""saw clinically significant effects."" 
They added that the trial ""achieved several significant advancements for the Alzheimer's field first by clinically confirming that P. gingivalis is a key upstream driver of disease progression. Further, the data demonstrated a compelling risk-benefit profile with a clinically significant treatment response in an easily identifiable population of patients.""
Casey Lynch, Cortexyme's CEO and co-founder, said ""The study was successful in accomplishing many of our objectives, including identification of the appropriate population for treatment and the therapeutic dose.

(Reuters) - A surge in international visitors to the United States may not benefit  Disney  and Universal theme parks in the country until next year, since early arrivals will focus on family reunions and holiday trips will need planning.
While domestic footfall rose in the parks operated by Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), capacity constraints, rising costs and fewer international travelers visits to its U.S. parks weighed on profits.
""Disney World in Orlando has more international travelers in general (compared to Disneyland) - it's a very big destination. And so it's not something people do on a whim, people need to plan that out,"" said Neil Macker, senior analyst at Morningstar.
In recent weeks, the United States opened its borders to fully-vaccinated international travelers and approved vaccines for children aged 5-11, boosting investor hopes and Disney shares.
Disney executives said they expect a recovery in international attendance only by the second half of next year and signaled a ramp-up in costs as well.
Some see domestic travelers keeping parks full.
""There is an expectation that stronger domestic demand will make up (for) the shortfall with signs of pent-up demand from holidaymakers who have been starved of vacations,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
However, the costs of running theme parks during a pandemic remain high and international travelers, who make up 10% to 20% of total U.S. theme park visitors, often buy more souvenirs and other high-profit items.

Executives at Comcast, which owns Universal theme parks, one of Disney's closest competitors, said that pre-pandemic profit levels are dependent on international visits.
""We are encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement in international visitation,"" Comcast CFO Brian Roberts has said.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 03:02PM ET</span>","Analysis-Musk’s Tesla sales cause a stir, but billionaires sell stock all the time","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If trading in the shares of Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other billionaire-owned companies is any indication, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) co-founder Elon Musk unloading part of his stake in the company may not be bad for the electric carmaker’s shares over the long term.
Musk, who sold roughly $5 billion worth Tesla shares over the last few days, will remain by far the largest single shareholder in Tesla, with approximately 15.5% of the company's outstanding shares after the full sale is completed. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, by comparison, owns about 14% of the online retailer, while Mark Zuckerberg owns about 14% of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc and controls a majority of its Class B stock. 
Bezos, Zuckerberg and Microsoft’s Bill Gates have all sold billions of dollars worth of stock this year, with little discernible impact on their companies’ share price, analysts and investors said. 
Tesla, of course, is not easily comparable to those companies, nor Musk to their billionaire founders. Shares of Tesla are up more than 1,400% over the last two years and trade at a whopping 346 times earnings, and the company tends to elicit extreme opinions from institutional and retail investors. 
Musk, for his part, is notoriously active on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) -- where he asked polled users on whether he should sell 10% of his stake -- and is at least as divisive as the company he co-founded. His recent activity raised questions about a potential violation https://www.reuters.com/business/tesla-shares-fall-after-musks-twitter-poll-backs-stake-sale-2021-11-08 of a 2018 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring him to have material tweets vetted by a lawyer.
Still, many on Wall Street believe the impact of Musk's potential stock sale may be overblown. Tesla shares are down nearly 15% from their Nov. 4 peak, falling following the Twitter poll and rebounding later in recent sessions. They were down 0.5% in choppy trading on Thursday. 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
'SMART MOVE'
Musk selling 10% of his stake in the company is sensible given the surge in the company's shares, which are up more than 50% year-to-date, said Ross Gerber, president of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki and a long-standing shareholder in Tesla.
“Every major tech entrepreneur and bitcoin owner is cashing out huge amounts of capital right now for huge profit so for Musk to take some money off the table is a smart move and he just announced it in a very Muskian way,” Gerber said. 
Meanwhile, “Bezos sells $2 billion and nobody blinks,"" he added, referring to Bezos's sale of approximately $2 billion worth of Amazon stock in early November. 
Bezos has sold approximately $8.8 billion worth of Amazon stock this year, and sold roughly $10 billion worth of Amazon stock last year, the proceeds of which he has used in part to fund his space tourism company known as Blue Origin. 
Those sales have likely had a ""negligible"" impact on the stock price of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at Loop Capital. Amazon’s shares are up 7.8% this year, underperforming the S&P 500’s 23.8% gain as investors have moved into cyclical stocks and rotated out of last year's strong performers. 
""No one really … thinks Bezos has less confidence in the company’s prospects. Amazon is so big and so liquid it doesn’t really move the needle,"" he said. 
Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has sold shares nearly every day this year through a periodic sale agreement. Those sales have had no ""discernable"" impact on the company's share price, said Joe Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research. Shares of the company are up 20.7% this year.
The closest comparison to Musk's decision to sell part of his stake may be Bill Gates, who divested his ownership in Microsoft by selling more than 20 million shares each quarter for more than a dozen years, analysts said. 
Microsoft's shares continued to rise despite that consistent selling in part because investors saw the sales as part of Gates' plan to give to charity and not an indication of his faith in the company, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has an outperform rating on Tesla shares.
Musk's selling aside, investors who have a bone to pick with Tesla have found plenty of targets.

George Schultze, head of Schultze Asset Management, said the share sales, together with Tesla's high valuation at a time when automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) are expanding into the electric vehicle market, suggest Tesla's rally may cool.
""If you put it all together it’s a sign of potential market top in Tesla stock,"" he said.

The sports utility vehicle (SUV) launch comes amid accelerating demand for EVs as nations around the world tighten environmental regulation to cut carbon emissions. Toyota last month announced its version of a battery electric vehicle (BEV), the bZ4X. 
The technological shift away from internal combustion engines poses a challenge for smaller carmakers, such as Subaru, that are less able to fund expensive development of EVs. At the same time, it is an opportunity for top-tier automakers, such as Toyota, to draw smaller rivals closer.
""The EV market is not mature yet, so we will respond to it by deepening our cooperation with Toyota,"" Subaru CEO Tomomi Nakamura said during a launch event. 
For now, he said, the Solterra would be built by Toyota in Japan and Subaru may move production to its main market, the United States, when it had sufficient sales volume. 
Toyota, a pioneer of hybrid electric cars but a latecomer to the full EV market, plans to have a line-up of 15 BEV models by 2025. It is also spending $13.5 billion over the next decade to expand auto battery production capacity.
Vehicle sales at Subaru are less than a tenth of those at Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by production volume. 

The front-wheel drive Solterra has a cruising range of 530 km (329 miles), while the all-wheel drive version can drive 460 km on a single charge, Subaru said in a press release. 
Toyota owns a fifth of Subaru and has a 5% stake in Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp, which plans to launch 13 electrified vehicles by 2025, including hybrids and BEVs that will incorporate Toyota technology.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>",Factbox-What happened with Musk's Tesla stock sales,"By Subrat Patnaik and Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk disclosed on Wednesday that he sold about $5 billion in shares, just days after the billionaire polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about offloading 10% of his stake in the electric carmaker.
It was the first time that Musk cashed out on a stake of that size since the electric carmaker was founded in 2003. 
HOW DID MUSK SELL?
Musk said on Saturday he would sell 10% of his stake if Twitter users agreed. The billionaire owned a combination of about 244 million shares through his trust and stock options, bringing his stake in the electric car maker to about 23% as of the end of June. The stake included 170 million shares held by his trust. 
Musk's tweet was vague. He did not outline if he was intending to offload 10% of his shares he indirectly owned through the trust or if his stock options were also part of this deal.
Then a flurry of transactions this week, his first share sale since 2016, reduced Musk's direct and indirect stake in Tesla to 168 million shares, from 170 million shares. 
Musk sold 934,000 shares for $1.1 billion on Monday to cover tax obligations associated with exercising options to buy nearly 2.2 million shares. 
The remaining 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4 billion, were sold through his trust on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The sale of a combined 4.5 million shares equates to about 3% of Musk's shares in Tesla. 
Musk had an option to buy 22.86 million shares at $6.24 each, which expire on Aug. 13, according to a Tesla filing.
After his exercise on 2.15 million stocks on Monday, he has options for 20 million more shares he needs to exercise by next August.

WHY DID MUSK CONSULT TWITTER USERS ABOUT THE STOCK SALES?
Musk has not responded to questions about why he launched a Twitter poll about the stock sales before embarking on them. It is also not clear whether the way he went about it breached any securities rules.
The stock sales that Musk launched were massive by capital market standards, bigger than the initial public offerings of most companies. By getting Twitter users to greenlight the move, he skirted speculation that he was cashing out because Tesla's valuation had become frothy after its shares reached record highs.
WHAT WILL MUSK DO WITH THE CASH?
Musk has not said how he will spend or invest roughly $4 billion he will pocket from the stock sales so far, which are taxable at capital gains rates. Musk, the world's richest man, had traditionally been content with having his wealth, pegged by Forbes at close to $280 billion, tied up in his Tesla stake. 

He has borrowed against his Tesla shares to raise cash.
Musk, also CEO of Space X, said on Wednesday that making life multi-planetary is the ""main reason for accumulating capital.""

Sales at the end of Nov. 11 surpassed the 498.2 billion yuan official tally for 2020. The strong performance could ease concerns among investors grappling with a 30% slump in Alibaba’s shares this year, which has seen the company hit with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine and report its first revenue miss in two years.  Alibaba’s U.S.-traded shares rose 3.3%.
Read more on how the crackdown has changed Singles’ Day
Since its debut in 2009, Singles’ Day has come to dwarf the U.S. Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in both intensity and size. Alibaba has turned the event into one part showcase of commercialism and one part publicity blitz, featuring enormous discounts to encourage consumption as well as headline-grabbing appearances by celebrities such as Taylor Swift in previous years. 
The 2020 edition roughly doubled sales from the prior year, as Alibaba added several days and additional services to the count. But the festivities this time around have been more low key, with Alibaba seeking to turn the focus from sales growth to its efforts in sustainability and philanthropy -- key pillars of President Xi Jinping’s drive to achieve “common prosperity.” 
Beijing has over the past 12 months introduced new regulations to rein in the country’s largest private corporations in areas from e-commerce to fintech, data security and online content. In the run up to Singles’ Day this year, authorities called on domestic e-commerce platforms to curb marketing spam via text messages and refrain from unfair pricing. 
While its gala this year featured appearances by Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch and Chinese popstar Jackson Yi, Alibaba broke with past years by not releasing gross merchandise value figures for the pre-sales period or the first minutes of Nov. 11 itself before the end of the event. Instead, Chief Marketing Officer Chris Tung told reporters the company is shifting its focus from pure GMV growth to “sustainable growth.”
“I believe the value that 11.11 offers is more than just the GMV figures,” Tung said at a press conference last month. 
Alibaba has pledged to donate 1 yuan each time Singles’ Day shoppers buy certain items and post their purchases on social media. In a nod to another of Xi’s signature goals -- to slash China’s carbon emissions  -- Alibaba’s platforms are also showcasing energy-efficient products during the shopping festival and its logistics network will help to recycle packaging. 
Analysts have long relied on the sales figure to gauge the health of China’s economy as well as the country’s No. 1 e-commerce platform operator. In recent years, Alibaba has confronted fierce competition from rivals such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. as well as live-streaming platforms run by the likes of ByteDance Ltd. after they also rolled out Singles’ Day promotions. China is also grappling with a new coronavirus outbreak that’s the broadest since the deadly pathogen first emerged in 2019, with government officials enacting increasingly aggressive measures that could derail economic activity.   
Alibaba’s revenue lagged consensus expectations during the June quarter, its first miss since 2019. The company will release its September quarter results on Nov. 18, with analysts on average forecasting a 33% increase in sales.

But there are stark differences: When Tesla went public in 2010, the Elon Musk-led firm disclosed $93 million in revenue and losses far below the $1 billion Rivian reported for the first half. What’s more, Tesla’s initial market capitalization was about $2 billion and didn’t reach $90 billion until 2020.
Eleven years later, Rivian is the world’s fifth-largest automaker by market cap having delivered only a few electric vehicles to customers. After gaining 29% in their first day of trading, Rivian shares soared as much as 24% Thursday, vaulting its valuation past General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
“Along with the IPO of Lucid (LCID) the race to be the ‘next Tesla’ is well underway and increasingly happening in public markets,” Ben Laidler, eToro global market strategist, wrote in a note. 
“Rivian’s valuation makes it a legitimate option for institutional investors who have previously only had Tesla to play the electric-vehicle space,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note. Colas said some investors cycle through new companies as they go public, selling the “‘old’ name and replacing it with the ‘new.’”
For the Rivian believers, the backing of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. makes the company a compelling buy. “Investors reacted with excitement to its backing from Amazon and its R1T pick-up truck which has earned rave reviews since its recent launch,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. 
Traditional automakers are trying to attract investors’ attention with their own EV development.
“General Motors is so undervalued as we start this wonderful period we’re in because we invested over three, four years ago in electric vehicles,” Mary Barra said in the The New York Times DealBook conference.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>","Cuban protest leader to march alone, white rose in hand, ahead of rallies","By Dave Sherwood 
(Reuters) - A Cuban playwright leading the call for protests on Nov. 15 on the communist-run island said on Thursday he will walk alone, in silence and holding a white rose, the day before the planned march to show the non-violent nature of the movement.
After Cuban dissidents, organized under a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group called Archipielago, asked in September for permission to rally, the authorities declared the marches illegal and accused the protesters of working with the United States to overthrow the government. 
Yunior Garcia, one of Archipielago's leaders, has rejected those arguments but said the possibility of violence had nonetheless led him to change his plans.
""We are not willing to have a single drop of blood spilled, on either side of this conflict,"" Garcia said in a Facebook post.
""On Sunday, Nov. 14, I will carry out a solitary march, on behalf of all citizens who have been deprived of their right by the regime to demonstrate on 15N [Nov. 15]."" 
He did not specifically say whether he will also march on Nov. 15.
Garcia's announcement came hours after Cuba's foreign minister Bruno Rodriguez convened diplomats in Havana on Wednesday and told them Cuba would not allow the protest. The government has alleged Garcia is seeking confrontation between demonstrators and the security forces.
""We will not allow it,"" Rodriguez told the diplomats in comments broadcast on state television. ""We will use our laws, our constitution and the strictest adherence to the principles of our socialist state of law and social justice.""
The planned rallies appear to have touched a nerve with the authorities in part because they were scheduled for the same day Cuba, hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S. embargo, reopens its borders to international tourists. The country has vaccinated nearly its entire population with a home-made inoculation and says cases of COVID-19, as well as deaths, have fallen sharply.
Several other groups organized under Archipielago's banner had already begun scaling back or modifying plans for a unified march on Nov. 15. Some have called for supporters to filter onto the street, dressed in white, but to refrain from marching together. 
The movement has also called for a ""cacerolazo,"" or pot banging, a traditional protest method in many parts of Latin America, on Sunday and Monday evenings in a show of solidarity. Others have called on supporters to hang white sheets from balconies or windows. 

Garcia called on the Cuban diaspora in cities worldwide to push forward with plans for rallies and said his decision should not impact fellow dissidents on the island.
""May everyone find ingenious and peaceful ways to express themselves without giving rise to violence against them, against anyone,"" he said in his Facebook post.

Read on.The consumer price index surged 6.2% year-over-year last month, its highest gain since 1990, driving investors’ inflation concerns. While other, positive, economic data should power the stock market, concerns over rising inflation could foster significant volatility in the near term.
However, according to Suze Orman, a popular personal finance expert, “Over the long-term, stocks have produced the best gains after factoring in inflation. Bonds and cash struggle to keep pace with inflation; only stocks have a track record of earning more than inflation.” Furthermore, Fed officials have reiterated that the rally in commodity prices is temporary, owing to production and delivery bottlenecks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the gridlock-driven inflation is expected to abate in the near term, we think investing in low-priced stocks gradually could churn out greater returns.

Despite oil prices starting to move higher in the latter part of 2020, activity in the shale regions didn’t pick up as shale projects are only economically viable with oil prices above $70.
Now, the situation is rapidly improving, as oil prices are above $80. There is also a material increase in rig counts in the shale patches with more if oil keeps trending higher. The passing of the infrastructure bill is another potential boom for TH’s government unit. Already, TH’s revenues are on the mend as sales in the last quarter were only 8% below 2019 levels.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler Truck will be spun off from Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) on Dec. 10, the commercial vehicle maker said on Thursday as it outlined the cost-cutting measures which it hopes will boost profit margins to a double-digit percentage by 2025.
The truckmaker, which aims to sell 60% electric models by 2030, is certain margins will remain the same or grow as it transitions to electric vehicles, CFO Jochen Goetz said at a presentation during its capital markets day. 
Driving an electric vehicle would cost customers the same or less than a diesel alternative in the long run due to lower fuelling costs, CEO Martin Daum reasoned, despite electric models still carrying a far heavier price tag upfront.
Daimler Truck's first battery-electric truck, the eActros, costs roughly three times its diesel equivalent.
""Cents per mile is the key question,"" Daum said. ""The biggest intangible is the price and cost for energy and CO2.""
HIGHER PRICES, LOWER COSTS
The commercial vehicle maker, the world's largest but currently reporting lower margins than rivals, is targeting 9% profit margins in Europe, 10% in Asia and 12% in North America by 2025, according to a statement released ahead of the presentation.
Cutting costs, raising prices and focusing on heavy-duty vehicles will bring it closer to that goal, board members said on Thursday.
A planned fixed cost reduction across the business of 15% from 2019 levels by 2025 is progressing faster than planned and will likely be achieved by 2023, the heavy vehicle maker said.
Alongside an already announced 300 million euro ($344 million) cut in personnel costs by 2025, which included reducing management positions by around 20%, Daimler Truck is reducing non-personnel costs by 200 million euros.
Improving market share and performance in Europe has long been a priority for the commercial vehicle maker. Its adjusted return on sales so far this year is 10.8% in North America, 7.2% in Asia and 4.5% in Europe, according to the presentation.
The bus division has reported a 2.6% loss so far this year, but will remain integrated into the business, CEO Martin Daum said when asked about the disparity in performance.
Chip shortages would continue to have a severe impact on revenues into 2022, Geotz said on Thursday, though the hope was that the worst was behind them.

""We have a clear goal ... we are determined to reach higher profitability and win the race to zero-emissions,"" Daum said.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index jumped as much as 5.2%, the biggest intraday climb since Oct. 7, after  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s Singles’ Day shopping festival posted record sales. A report that ride-hailing company Didi Global is getting ready to launch its apps in China by the end of the year also gave stocks mired in Beijing’s regulatory clampdown earlier this year a boost.

Alibaba gained as much as 3.5%, while other tech stocks like JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. soared 8.3% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. rallied 7.7%. Didi’s shares fluctuated between gains and losses Thursday.
“The solid Singles’ Day performance alleviates some recent concerns around weakness in consumption trends in China,” said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jiong Shao in an email. “The group has been under a lot of pressure since earlier this year with many stock prices having been cut in half or more. Hopefully this is the beginning of a sustainable rebound for the group.”
The broad rally in American depository receipts of Chinese companies comes after the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8% to close at the highest level in more than two weeks, with Meituan Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. being the largest contributors. 
A spate of positive news in the property sector is also adding to investor exuberance that Beijing may be relaxing restrictions on how developers raise funds. Dow Jones said China’s central bank is considering easing rules to help developers sell assets to avoid defaults, after a similar report by local media Cailian. On Wednesday, the state-run Securities Times reported that rules for developers to issue domestic bonds may be loosened. 
It’s, however, still too early to say if this could be the turning point in China’s crackdown. 
“There are still investor reservations,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading Institutional Services. “In combination with the reports the government is easing property restrictions investors are gravitating the largest most established names first in hopes of a more receptive business environment.”

Moreover, analysts expect the stock market to remain upbeat in the coming months on favorable economic data. Citi’s Anthony Pettinari said in a note that “We view this generational investment as a significant catalyst for growth for a number of our stocks.”
The Labor Department reported yesterday that weekly jobless claims decreased to 267,000. After slow growth in the third quarter, the U.S. economy is expected to achieve strong growth in the fourth quarter. In addition, more economic growth is expected next year, fueled by the continued expansion in consumer and government spending, which have raised investors’ confidence.

Investing.com –  Marqeta  stock (NASDAQ:MQ) jumped 5% Thursday as the company’s third-quarter sales and earnings came in well ahead of estimates, driven by a surge in volumes processed.
The company reported total processing volume of $27.6 billion in the September quarter, up 60% as both digital banking and buy-now-pay-later businesses grew. TPV represents the total dollar amount of payments processed through the platform, net of returns and chargebacks.
Net revenue rose 56%, to $132 million, slightly offset by higher revenue share as the company handed out more incentives to customers to increase processing volumes on its platform.
Marqeta’s modern card issuing platform allows its customers to create customized payment cards and is behind BNPL brands like Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) and Klarna. The company added more partners during the quarter, namely Bill.com and Figure.
The BNPL option has been the mainstay of credit card companies for decades. However, most fintech BNPLs don't charge interest. Instead, they make their money on the difference between what they pay the merchant and what they subsequently recoup from the buyer.
The net loss more than tripled to $45.7 owing to stock-based compensation to staff and investments in hiring and technology.
Net revenue for the ongoing quarter is expected to be $137 million to $139 million, up 55% year-over-year. That should help the company close the year with revenue of around $498.5 million.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A second supercomputer and artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades form part of Sberbank's enhanced offerings of digital services such as cloud computing and virtual assistant software, Chief Technology Officer David Rafalovsky told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Russia's largest lender is investing more in non-banking services as it shifts towards offering more technology systems, even last year dropping ""bank"" from its logo. On Thursday it unveiled the Christofari Neo, a second supercomputer, to meet internal and external AI demand that has exceeded expectations. 
The supercomputer was named after the bank's first ever customer 180 years ago, Nikolai Christofari. 
The lender, alongside other Russian firms including  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) and Tinkoff, is developing a so-called ecosystem of services beyond its core business, something Sberbank says is needed to combat traditional banks' shrinking margins. 
The central bank has proposed that banks may need to create additional buffers if ecosystem investments exceed 30% of their total capital, but the final decision is yet to be made.
But Rafalovsky said Sberbank, whose ecosystem includes e-commerce, cyber security and cloud services, had room to continue investing hundreds of millions of dollars in technology. 
""We are not constrained in terms of ability to invest, in terms of capital,"" Rafalovsky said in an interview. ""We are investing more now (than a year ago). Our investments in core IT infrastructure and products overall went up.""
He said Sberbank's primary technological constraint was attracting the best information technology (IT) talent.
Sberbank needs that talent to further expand its technological arsenal. The most ""commercially significant"" update, Rafalovsky said, was ML Space Private, an AI development toolkit that third parties can use without fully connecting to SberCloud.
This, he said, was significant for many Russian firms that may be unable to run sensitive data through Sberbank's commercial cloud platform. 
Sberbank, majority owned by Russia's government, has assets of 36.8 trillion roubles ($521.5 billion) and a market value of about $113 billion.
Chief Executive Officer German Gref on Tuesday said Sberbank was eyeing expanding its digital offering in other European countries while Rafalovsky hinted that spin offs of digital assets were possible in time. 
""We are set up to be able to do it when the time is right,"" he said. ""The timing of doing this is as important as having something to spin off.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Large parts of the world are not ready for zero-emission vehicles, which is why  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp did not sign a pledge this week to phase out fossil-fuel cars by 2040, the world's largest automaker said on Thursday.
Six major carmakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford, Sweden's Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz, signed the Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, as did a number of countries including India.
But Toyota and No. 2 global automaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), as well as crucial car markets the United States, China and Germany did not.
A spokesperson for Toyota told Reuters that where the energy and charging infrastructure, economics and customer readiness exist, ""we are ready to accelerate and help support with appropriate zero-emission vehicles."" 
""However, in many areas of the world such as Asia, Africa, Middle East ... an environment suitable for promoting full zero emission transport has not yet been established,"" the spokesperson said. ""We think it will take more time to make progress...; thus, it is difficult for us to commit to the joint statement at this stage."" 
According to a study published by the Munich Mobility Show in April, there are huge global disparities in electric vehicle ownership.
Sales are soaring in the European Union, China and the United States. 
But cumulative electric car registrations through 2020 in South America, with a population of more than 420 million, were below 18,000.
And registrations in Africa, home to 1.2 billion people, were exclusively in South Africa and totaled just 1,509 cars through 2020. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) also said the tempo of electric vehicle adoption would ""vary from region to region"" and Chief Executive Herbert Diess dismissed the zero-emission pledge at a conference on Wednesday.

""It could still make sense to use synthetic fuel cars in Latin America in 2035,"" Diess said.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Didi prepares to relaunch apps in China, anticipates data probe will end soon -sources","By Julie Zhu and Yilei Sun
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Didi Global is preparing to relaunch its ride-hailing and other apps in China by the end of the year in anticipation that Beijing's cybersecurity investigation into the company will be wrapped up by then, three people directly involved in the relaunch said. 
The people, who declined to be identified as the information was private, said they expected China's cyberspace regulator to finalise any penalties on the company in December.
The company has set aside 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) for a potential fine, said one of the sources.
In July, the powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered app stores to remove 25 mobile apps operated by Didi - just days after the ride-hailing giant listed in New York. It also told the company to stop registering new users, citing national security and the public interest.
Asked about its preparations to relaunch the apps and the amount set aside for a potential fine, Didi said the information obtained by Reuters was ""pure hearsay with no grounds in fact"" and that it was cooperating actively and fully with the cybersecurity review. It did not elaborate further.
The CAC did not respond to a request for comment.
Didi shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose as much as more 6.7% in early trading on Thursday following the Reuters report before slipping back.
Didi, which has about 377 million annual active users in China, provides 25 million rides a day to users in the country who sign into its app with a phone number and password. Its apps also offer other products such as delivery and financial services.
It ran afoul of the CAC when it pressed ahead with its New York listing on June 30, even though the regulator had urged the company to put it on hold while a cybersecurity review of its data practices was conducted, sources have told Reuters.
Soon after, the CAC launched an investigation into Didi over its collection and use of personal data. It said data had been collected illegally and the apps concerned including for its camera device, as well as delivery and financial services. 
NEW DATA LAW
Didi responded at the time by saying it had stopped registering new users and would make changes to comply with rules on national security and personal data protection, and would protect users' rights. 
Didi has since been making changes to the apps to ensure they comply with China's Personal Information Protection Law which took effect on Nov. 1, the three people with knowledge of the matter said, adding that all staff had to complete training about the new law.
The changes include an updated and lengthy user agreement for customers to sign that clearly defines what data will be collected and how it will be used, said one of the sources.
The company is also working on new strategies to recruit drivers for the relaunch as many moved to rival services due to uncertainty surrounding the business because of the investigation, this source added.
Its shares have halved since its New York debut to leave its valuation at $43 billion. The investigation came amid a slew of regulatory moves by Beijing that have upended norms for a range of sectors from tech to property to private tutoring.
In particular, China has instructed its technology giants to provide more secure storage of user data amid public complaints about mismanagement and misuse that have resulted in privacy violations.

The new Personal Information Protection Law states that the handling of information must have a clear and reasonable purpose, lays out conditions under which companies can collect personal data and offers guidelines for ensuring data is protected when it is transferred outside the country.

Investing.com — Lordstown Motors Corp (NASDAQ:RIDE) said late Wednesday that Taiwan-based electronics company Foxconn is going ahead with plans to acquire its vehicle manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio.
The companies will go ahead with the previously announced deal that will see Foxconn pay $230 million for the facility — providing a much-needed boost for the cash-strapped electric vehicle company.
Foxconn has agreed to make a down payment of $100 million by November 18, subsequent payments of $50 million on February 1, and no later than April 15. The balance of the purchase price will be paid at closing. Once the transaction is closed, Foxconn will receive 1.7 million warrants to acquire Lordstown common stock, exercisable for three years, at $10.50 per share.
Lordstown shares have rallied over 15%, to $6.43 so far Thursday.
After signing the agreement in September, they told investors that Foxconn purchased $50 million of common stock from Lordstown Motors at about $6.89 per share.
The companies will work on Lordstown's electric vehicle programs in the Ohio production and assembly plant.
They have also agreed to continue a manufacturing agreement for the Endurance pickup truck, while they will pursue a joint venture to co-design and develop vehicle programs for the global commercial fleet market. "

Investing.com – The  Honest Company  stock (NASDAQ:HNST) surged 12% Thursday as the company sold more diapers and skin and personal care products to go past analysts’ estimate for its third-quarter revenue.
It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue and volume growth for the company, which focuses on sustainable processes and products.
Year-on-year revenue growth of 6% to around $83 million was led by diapers and wipes and skin and personal care. The categories collectively grew 20% compared to the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by a decline in household and wellness products.
The company also reaped the benefit of expanded distribution, closing September with 40,000 retail locations.
Diapers and wipes contributed 65% of the company’s third-quarter revenue.
With more people vaccinated now and able to move out freely, retail channel revenue rose and pulled ahead of digital revenue after trailing for several quarters.
Household and wellness products sales were dampened as consumer demand for sanitization and disinfecting products weakened after growing strongly during the pandemic.
The net loss more than doubled to $5.1 million and fell short of expectations."

The Troy, Michigan-based company said it now expects to build between 300 and 500 of its Class 1 small electric delivery van, instead of the 1,000 it said in August it was targeting. ELMS said it would deliver the rest of those orders in the first quarter of 2022.
ELMS Chief Executive James Taylor said suppliers had been hit by constraints, including the tighter availability of shipping containers, port congestion and delays in the freight system.
""We had really good line of sight on 300 to 500 based on where the parts were coming through the system ... but the 1,000 number was unreasonably out of reach,"" he said in an interview.
ELMS has not revealed its 2022 full-year production targets yet.
Taylor also said ELMS, which went public in June through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is on track to launch the certified production version of the Urban Delivery van in December.

The startup, which has an assembly plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, also said its 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.
Following the small van launch, ELMS has said it plans to build a larger Class 3 truck in the second half of 2022, but Taylor said customers are pushing the company to accelerate that timeline.

Investing.com —  Paysafe  Ltd (NYSE:PSFE) shares fell 40% on Thursday after the company cut 2021 revenue guidance.
The company, which is backed by Blackstone and CVC Capital, cut full-year 2021 revenue guidance to between $1.47 billion and $1.48 billion, compared to the previous range of $1.53 billion and $1.55 billion. Consensus estimates expected $1.54 billion. Paysafe also cut gross profit and adjusted earnings guidance for 2021. 
The reduction was attributed to ""gambling regulations and softness in key European markets"" and performance challenges that influence its digital wallet segment alongside the scope and timing of new ecommerce customer agreements.
Paysafe's third quarter revenue fell 1%, to $353.6 million and missed the consensus of $370.59 million. Adjusted earnings also fell 1%, to $106.4 million.
Total payment volume increased 19%, to $31.1 billion.
Philip McHugh, CEO of Paysafe, stated: ""In the third quarter we reported Adjusted EBITDA in line with our expectations, despite softer than expected revenue, reflecting both market and performance challenges within the digital wallet business. 
 ""While the recent trend will drive an adjusted financial outlook, we continue to see strong momentum across the business. Our position to win in high growth and disruptive markets including online sports betting and crypto continues to accelerate, coupled with strong delivery against our cost and technology platform targets.""
Paysafe shares are currently priced at $4.34."

By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Sleep apnea tied to severe COVID-19
The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 is higher in people with obstructive sleep apnea and other breathing problems that cause oxygen levels to drop during sleep, researchers say. They tracked 5,402 adults with these problems and found that roughly a third of them eventually tested posted for the coronavirus. While periodic episodes of not-breathing while asleep - leading to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia - did not increase people's chances of being infected, sleep-related hypoxia did increase infected patients' odds of needing to be hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, Drs. Cinthya Pena Orbea and Reena Mehra of the Cleveland Clinic and colleagues reported on Wednesday in JAMA Network Open. It is not clear if treatments that improve sleep apnea, such as CPAP machines that push air into patients' airways during sleep, would also reduce the risk of severe COVID-19, said Pena Orbea and Mehra.
Body's coronavirus memory may abort new infections
Healthcare workers who did not test positive for COVID-19, despite heavy exposure to infected patients, had T cells that attacked a part of the virus that lets it make copies of itself, according to a report published Wednesday in Nature. Researchers who studied the 58 healthcare workers found their T cells responded more strongly to a part of the virus, called the RTC, that is very similar on all human and animal coronaviruses, including all variants of SARS-CoV-2. They suspect the T cells recognized the RTC because they had ""seen"" it on other viruses during other infections. That makes the RTC a potentially good target for vaccines if more research confirms these findings, study leaders Mala Maini and Leo Swadling, both of University College London, said in a joint email to Reuters. These data were collected during the first wave of the pandemic, they added. ""We don't know if this sort of control happens for more infectious variants currently circulating.""
Vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies in breast milk

Infants might benefit from COVID-19 antibodies in breast milk regardless of whether mothers acquired the antibodies from being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or from vaccines, according to new findings reported on Wednesday in JAMA Pediatrics. Researchers studied antibodies in breast milk samples from 47 mothers who had been infected with the virus and 30 healthy mothers who had received the vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech. Antibodies from both groups were able to neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus, and while antibodies from infection were evident in milk for longer periods, antibody levels from vaccination ""were much more uniform,"" said study leader Bridget Young of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in New York. Thus, there is likely benefit to getting vaccinated even after a COVID-19 infection because breast milk would then contain a diverse variety of antibodies, she said. The researchers did not study the effect of the antibodies on the babies who consumed the milk.

(Reuters) -Tapestry Inc expects to have plenty of its luxury  Coach  handbags on store shelves during the holiday season despite supply chain snags, allowing it to boost its annual sales and profit forecasts.
Shares of the New York-based fashion house rose 10% on Thursday as the company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program. 
The luxury goods industry has bounced back sharply this year from pandemic-driven weakness in 2020, as the revival of social events, parties and office work spur consumers to splurge on their wardrobes. 
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR)'s U.S. peers Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) and Michael Kors Owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) Ltd have also lifted their annual sales forecasts.
While sales have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, analysts had concerns that factory closures in Vietnam, where Tapestry sources about 40% of its products from, would lead to shortages of handbags during the holiday season.
About 10% of Coach and Kate Spade's annual handbag production, worth $1.1 billion in sales, has been lost due to months-long factory closures that started in July, according to an estimate from BTIG.
But with factories now reopening, Tapestry said it had pulled forward shipping timelines and will spend about $70 million on airfreight in the second quarter to get products in stores in time for Christmas shopping.
""We're taking deliberate steps to accelerate inventory growth, and we feel comfortable in our inventory positioning to meet demand,"" Tapestry Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said.

Tapestry raised its fiscal 2022 revenue forecast to nearly $6.6 billion from a previous forecast of $6.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.45 to $3.50 from $3.30 to $3.35.
Net sales rose 26% to $1.48 billion in the first quarter ended Oct. 2, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Trading was depressed by the Veterans Day holiday, and the lack of economic data or major corporate news overnight has left the market exposed to drift according to sentiment in the near term.
Stocks standing out in early trading included Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), which fell 9.0% after reporting a sharp slowdown in new subscribers for its Disney+ streaming service in the quarter, as well as a disappointing performance from its theme parks, where the summer wave of Covid-19 prevented a more vigorous rebound. Disney's numbers - where its other streaming services ESPN+ and Hulu also fell short of expectations - contrasted sharply with those of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which had surprised to the upside with subscriber numbers over the summer period.
 Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock also slumped 15% after the dating site reported a drop in active users in the past three months, confirming a pattern also evident in Match Group's (NASDAQ:MTCH) disappointing numbers last week.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock was another decliner. The maker of plant-based meat products issued guidance well below Wall Street forecasts for the fourth quarter after reporting that sales to restaurants had fallen in the third quarter, suggesting that the market had been too quick to discount its products going mainstream.  The stock fell 17% to its lowest in 19 months. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock eked out a modest gain after filings showed that CEO Elon Musk had sold nearly $5 billion of stock in the last three days. That's enough to cover his looming tax bill triggered by the exercise of options that were previously granted him as compensation, but less than one-third of what he suggested he might sell after his social media poll at the weekend. 
Tesla's newest rival in the electric vehicle space, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), surged meanwhile by another 11%, adding to the 29% gains it posted on its debut on Wednesday. The electric van maker is now more valuable than either its 5% owner Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), despite never yet having sold a vehicle.
Fintech stocks enjoyed mixed fortunes, reflecting their respective quarterly updates: SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock rose 13% after beating estimates for loan growth and revenue, while  Paysafe  (NYSE:PSFE) stock fell 40% after downbeat guidance on margins and revenue growth."

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) tumbled more than 18% in premarket trading Thursday as the maker of plant-based meat signaled more pain ahead after a weak third quarter.
Beyond Meat is now forecasting current-quarter revenue at $110 million at the top end, well below Reuters estimates of around $132 million. On the lower side, it sees $85 million in revenue. Fourth-quarter revenue last year was $102 million.
The third quarter threw more than a little surprise at the fake meat maker as fewer people stocked plant-based burgers and sausages at home after they resumed eating out.
Sales of its products at restaurants also suffered as labor shortage forced owners to cut their hours and trim menus. Severe weather, leading to operational challenges, also played the spoilsport, according to the company.
Partnerships, like one with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), were slow to take off.
The retail segment in the U.S., the company’s biggest source of revenue, suffered the most. U.S. net revenue fell about 14%.
Total net revenue rose nearly 13% to over $106 million. The net loss was $54.8 million, or 87 cents a share. As a percentage of net revenue, it was over 51%, almost quadrupling from second quarter’s 13%."

(Reuters) - Shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) slumped 19% on Thursday after the faux meat maker signaled slowing demand at restaurants and grocers with a weak sales forecast, raising questions on whether its business is nearing saturation.
Sales of its plant-based meat fell at several fast-food chains in the third quarter, when the country was in the grip of Delta COVID-19 variant and restaurants were cutting hours and trimming menus to battle a labor shortage.
At least seven brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with several analysts expecting the company to continue facing a slowdown. Beyond Meat on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue of $85 million to $110 million, well below estimates of $131.6 million.
""We view the results as further evidence that Beyond's business is reaching market saturation faster than expected and that the company has deeper problems that won't be easy to fix,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Moskow said.
""Consumer interest in Beyond is simply reaching a peak."" 
Three years back Beyond Meat's sales growth and stock were on a tear, as popular fast-food chains, including Tim Hortons and Yum Brands Inc's KFC, and several retailers tied up with company to sell its products.
That blistering pace of growth, however, has hit a speed bump, with the pandemic and the entry of newer players such as Impossible Foods into the market. Its stock is also down 24% for the year.
""With increased competition over the past two years, we're seeing, as expected, some impact on our market share,"" CEO Ethan Brown said on an earnings call.
He also said customers seemed less likely to try out newer products during the pandemic.

""Given the drop in revenues in Q3, a still-pressured Q4, revenue growth uncertainty in the near-term and into 2022 increases,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Rob Dickerson said.
""This was the quarter that likely broke the camel's back.""

Investing.com – SoFi Technologies stock (NASDAQ:SOFI) climbed more than 16% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company raised its annual guidance after recording its second-best quarter for member growth.
The fintech platform now expects its annual adjusted revenue to top $1 billion, up from its previous guidance of $980 million. By the close of the third quarter, the company had exceeded $1 billion in annualized runrate revenue.
Total members on the platform grew 96% year-over-year to 2.9 million, with new additions at approximately 377,000. It had added around 279,000 new members in the second quarter.
SoFi also raised its outlook for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $2.5 million to $29.5 million.
Total net revenue jumped 35% in the third quarter to $272 million and comfortably beat estimates. Lending volumes rose across all loan types year-over-year in the third quarter, with personal and student loans the largest drivers of the overall 15% increase.
SoFi's net loss narrowed by more than expected to $30 million from nearly $43 million in the same quarter of 2020.
SoFi said it continues to look for opportunities beyond lending. EV-maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) set aside 0.4% of its IPO shares for users of SoFi's trading platform, letting them invest at the offer price of $78 before public trading started. The shares rose 29% on their debut on Wednesday.

799,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 07:54AM ET</span>",Netflix’s  Is Closing In on Disney Again In Terms of Market Value ,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). is close to overtaking Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. in market value for the first time since last year, after the amusement park owner’s earnings stoked concerns about slowing subscriber growth in its streaming business.
A 25% advance since the end of July has boosted Netflix’s market value to $287 billion. Disney is poised to see its market value shrink to about $300 billion when markets open on Thursday, falling 4.9% in premarket trading.
While Netflix’s subscriber growth has been boosted by hit shows such as Squid Game, additions to the Disney+ streaming app missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday evening. The Disney World theme-park owner has made the family streaming product its major focus for growth in coming years.
For  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Benjamin Swinburne, streaming is key to Disney’s investment case. His overweight rating “is based on the view that Disney is one of a shortlist of global streaming platforms that can achieve significant scale and profitability.” But he doesn’t see that priced into the shares yet.
Wall Street is generally more bullish on Disney than Netflix. About 78% of analysts have buy ratings on the former and none recommend selling, while 73% recommend buying Netflix and five have sell ratings. Average price targets imply 15% upside for Disney and 5.3% for Netflix.
Widening Premium
Netflix shares trade at a widening premium to Disney’s based on Wall Street’s preferred valuation measure, enterprise value to projected earnings excluding costs like interest and taxes. Netflix is priced at about twice Disney’s enterprise value to projected Ebitda, according to Bloomberg data.
The premium is due to a chasm in the amount of revenue the companies generate per streaming subscriber, according to Geetha Ranganathan, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Netflix customers contribute almost three times the average revenue per month than Disney+ subscribers.
“Disney’s singular aim was to garner that Netflix-type multiple, and they’ve succeeded mostly,” said Ranganathan. “The big question is whether Disney can continue to exceed expectations for streaming subscriber growth without sacrificing profitability.”
Rivian’s Starry Debut  
Another valuation debate right now surrounds  Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). The electric vehicle maker surged 29% in its first day of trading after attracting a flurry of retail investor buying. That pushed its market capitalization to $86 billion, above that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., despite having no meaningful revenue.
Rivian continued its rally on Thursday, rising 9% in premarket trading. It was the most-traded stock on Fidelity’s brokerage platform on Wednesday, with buy orders totaling nearly three times second-ranked Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Rivian’s surge outpaced the average performance of this year’s technology debuts, which have jumped by an average of 23%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Among tech IPOs that raised at least $1 billion, Rivian had the best debut session since Kanzhun Ltd. surged 96% in June.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Burberry's rebound stalls after disruption in China,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Burberry's sales flatlined in the second quarter due to bad weather and COVID-19 travel restrictions in China, taking the shine off the fashion brand's better than expected profit.
Shares in the company fell as much as 10% in early Thursday trading, giving up the gains they have made since mid-October after it reported flat like-for-like second-quarter store sales compared to two years ago, before the pandemic struck.
They later pared some of their losses to trade down 5% at 1,862.5 pence.
Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said footfall in China dropped in August but it recovered in September and October was in line with expectations.
China is Burberry's biggest market, and growth in the country, along with South Korea and the United States drove its revenue to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of its financial year. 
Worries about the strength of China's economy and an initiative to redistribute wealth, named ""common prosperity"" by President Xi Jinping, have hit the luxury sector.
Brown, however, said Burberry had seen no sign of a drop in demand, aside from the disruption seen in August. 
""Our market tends to be the upper middle class and we are actually finding that momentum has continued,"" she said.
Trading in Burberry's home market and elsewhere in Europe ""remained difficult"" due to low tourism, Brown said, with first-half sales down 31% from two years ago.
Sales of personal luxury goods may not return to pre-COVID levels in Europe until 2024, consultancy Bain said on Thursday, although it expects global luxury goods sales to outpace pre-COVID levels this year, fuelled by domestic spending in the United States and China.
Burberry, which recently poached Versace boss Jonathan Akeroyd to be its new chief executive, reported revenue of 1.21 billion pounds ($1.64 billion) for the six months to Sept. 25, up 45% at constant exchange rates.
Adjusted operating profit came in at 196 million pounds, nearly four times the level achieved a year ago and beating expectations.
Chairman Gerry Murphy said Burberry remained confident of achieving its medium-term goals of high single-digit top line growth and margin improvement. 
The company, known for its camel, black and red check and new ""TB"" monogram, said full-price sales almost doubled in the Americas, while South Korea grew almost 80%, and mainland China was up over 40%. 

Akeroyd will join Burberry next April, succeeding Marco Gobbetti, who announced his departure in June, midway into a multi-year turnaround to take the brand further up-market.

While the recent CPI figure is worse than expected, that doesn't mean there will be a return to the 1970s. While inflation may run hotter and more broadly through the end of the year, I still believe things will cool down next year as the economy completely recovers from the pandemic. I will talk about the effect I think this will have on the S&P 500 (SPY) and more in this week's commentary. Read on below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published November 10, 2021 from the POWR Value newsletter).
Unless you haven't checked the news today, you must know the big topic is inflation. Inflation in the U.S hit a three-decade high last month, rising at a 6.2% annual rate. The consumer price index rose at its fastest annual pace since 1990 and topped 5% for the fifth consecutive month. Sequentially, the CPI jumped 0.9% in October from September.
This was a much higher jump from September's 0.4% increase. Inflation was driven by supply shortages and strength in consumer demand, which has pushed prices higher. Even core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 4.6% from the prior year.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Wix (NASDAQ:WIX).com, which helps companies build and operate websites, said on Thursday it was converting more customers from free to premium services as it raised its revenue outlook for the year.
Wix said its business was returning to normal following a dip during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There still is uncertainty. But as time passes people are going more and more back to normal,"" chief financial officer Lior Shemesh told Reuters after issuing third-quarter results that beat estimates.
""We hope that will continue, but it's really encouraging.""
After trimming 2021 estimates in August, Wix raised them again and now projects 2021 revenue of $1.265-$1.274 billion, up from a previous outlook of $1.255-$1.270 billion. Analysts on average forecast revenue of $1.266 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Shemesh said Wix was adding features that were converting more customers from free to premium services, raising its average revenue per user (ARPU). ""More than anything it's a good sign for next year,"" he said.
The Israeli company reported a less-than-expected quarterly net loss excluding one-time items of 21 cents per share, compared with a loss 14 cents a year earlier. Revenue grew 26% to $321 million.
Analysts had forecast Wix would lose 42 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $315 million.

The company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $324-$333 million, in line with analysts' expectations of $329 million.
Shemesh said that Wix, whose Nasdaq listed shares are down some 20% so far in 2021, has been partly impacted by the strong shekel, which stands at a 25-year high versus the dollar and so the firm lowered its 2021 free cash flow estimate to $22-$27 million from $35-$40 million to reflect that.

Investing.com – ADRs of ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) traded 4.4% higher in premarket Thursday as the steelmaker posted its highest quarterly profit since 2008 while expanding its share repurchase plan.
Booming economies and stretched supplies resulted in higher steel prices and the world’s largest steelmaker outside of China rode that to deliver $4.6 billion in net profit in the third quarter. That compared to a loss in the same period in 2020. EBITDA per ton of steel sold by ArcelorMittal, at $414, was nearly eight times what it was a year earlier.
Sales were up more than 52% at $20.22 billion.
Steel shipments fell 9% on order cancellations from clients in the automobile sector, which has cut production sharply due to a lack of semiconductors. Demand from China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, was also weak, owing to troubles in the country’s real estate sector.
Arcelor said it expects global steel demand to grow by between 12% and 13% this year excluding China. It now expects a slight contraction in Chinese steel demand in 2021, due to weaker demand from the real estate sector. It had previously expected Chinese demand to grow by 3%-5%.
Chief Executive Officer Aditya Mittal expects to put production constraints and shipment delays behind in the fourth quarter. He said “underlying demand is expected to continue to improve, and, although marginally off the recent record highs, steel prices remain at elevated levels, something which will be reflected in the annual contracts for 2022.”
The company also topped its ongoing share buyback program by $1 billion. Of the $5-billion buyback announced by the company since September 2020, $1.8 billion was still outstanding before the announcement.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cash-strapped developer China Evergrande Group once again averted a destabilising default with a last minute bond payment but the reprieve did little to alleviate strains in the country's wider property sector.
Customers of international clearing firm Clearstream received overdue interest payments on three dollar bonds issued by Evergrande, a Clearstream spokesperson said on Thursday.
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are dollar bonds.
The latest payments were made at the end of a 30-day grace period that ended Wednesday, and were the third time in the past month the company has paid up perilously close to a deadline. The bonds had a total of more than $148 million due.
A failure to pay would have resulted in a formal default by the company and triggered cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar bonds, exacerbating a debt crisis looming over the world's second-largest economy.
Although the developer managed to sidestep imminent disaster, woes in the country's $5 trillion property sector showed no signs of abating with a wall of debt coming due.
""The near-term fix seems to be happening but there's a long way to go before this issue gets sorted out. These are early days,"" said a source with knowledge of the matter, referring to Evergrande and declining to be named without authorisation to talk to the media.
Evergrande did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
Bankers and analysts told Reuters that Beijing would stand firm on policies to curb excess borrowing by property developers even as it makes financing tweaks amid an industry liquidity crunch. 
Evergrande has coupon payments totalling more than $255 million due on Dec. 28. It has come under pressure from its other creditors at home and a stifling funding squeeze has cast a shadow over hundreds of its residential projects.
Investor focus is now also shifting to other cash-strapped developers which have a string of offshore payments coming due in the short term, including Kaisa Group.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after Evergrande and pleaded for help from creditors this week. It has coupon payments totalling over $59 million due on Thursday and Friday, with 30-day grace periods for both.
It was not immediately known if Kaisa, which became China's first property company to default on an overseas bond in 2015, has made payment for the tranche due on Thursday. It has already missed payments on some wealth management products at home. 
The developer did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. 
HARD LANDING 
While the U.S. Federal Reserve this week warned China's troubled property sector could pose global risks, there were no clear indications Beijing would step in with a broader, national plan to tackle the issue. 
Chinese regulators have in recent weeks, however, sought to reassure investors and homebuyers, saying risks were controllable and excessive credit tightening by banks was being corrected.
Regulators and government think tanks have also held meetings with developers in the past few weeks, and the market is expecting some easing in credit and housing policies to prevent a hard landing of the sector.
Those hopes and Evergrande's payment sparked a relief rally across Chinese property shares, with an index of real estate A-shares surging 9%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index closing up 5.6%.
Shares of Evergrande closed up 6.8% to a two-week high.
Chinese developers' bond prices, which have been hit hard in recent weeks, soared even higher. 
Duration Finance data showed the price on China Aoyuan Group's 5.88% March 2027 bond jumping more 30% on the day, although it continued to trade at deeply distressed levels of around 36 cents in the dollar. 
Evergrande's April 2022 notes jumped 4% from midnight to 28.886 cents on the dollar in the afternoon, yielding 620%, though still off from the 30.289 earlier this week, according to Duration Finance data.
The developer's bond due March 2024 traded at 24.839, up from 23.692 on Wednesday, the data showed. 
Bonds issued by Times China Holdings Xinyuan Real Estate, Yuzhou Group Holdings and Sunac China Holdings also rose more than 10%.
An index of dollar-denominated Asian high-yield bonds rose more than 1%, while Chinese high-yield corporate dollar spreads narrowed from record highs.

Developers including Evergrande and Kaisa have also been looking to sell some of their business assets in China and elsewhere to raise cash amid rapidly growing repayment obligations.
British electric motor maker Saietta said on Thursday that it is acquiring electric powertrain company e-Traction from Evergrande's automotive unit in a deal worth up to 2 million euros ($2.31 million).

805,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-China property financing tweaks fall short of investor expectations,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will stand firm on policies to curb excess borrowing by property developers even as it makes financing tweaks to help home buyers and meet ""reasonable"" demand amid an industry liquidity crunch, say bankers and analysts. 
Investors are worried about wider contagion from the property sector which has seen a string of missed offshore debt payments and sell-offs in shares and bonds as China Evergrande Holdings, the world's most indebted developer, repeatedly lurches to the brink of default.
On Thursday, stocks rose as investors snapped up battered property shares, heartened by Evergrande's last-minute coupon payment and bets on a potential relaxation of curbs on finance in the sector after data showed a surge in October mortgages. 
State media also reported that developers and a bond market industry group discussed potential debt issuance by developers in the inter-bank market, in what would be an easing of restrictions.
But there is little evidence that rules to contain a debt build-up in a sector - including related businesses - that accounts for a quarter of the world's second largest economy, will be pared back. 
""There are absolutely no fundamental changes or relaxations on the property lending caps,"" said a banker at a state lender in Beijing who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media. ""But there's always leeway for lenders to adjust for themselves to reflect the latest guidance of 'meeting the normal financing needs' of both home buyers and developers.""
Many developers including Evergrande, have grown desperately short of cash since authorities last year unveiled the ""three red lines"" - a key policy of President Xi Jinping that imposes limits on liabilities-to-assets, net debt-to-equity, and cash-to-short term borrowing ratios.
Authorities have also slapped lending restrictions on mortgages to deter speculative home buying that has driven up prices and exacerbated an affordability crisis for city dwellers struggling to get on the property ladder. 
CLEARING BACKLOG
While some banks have accelerated disbursement of approved home loans in some cities, no fresh wave of new approvals has been granted, bankers recently told Reuters.
In a departure from its practice of releasing mortgage data on a quarterly basis, the central bank on Wednesday issued a one-line statement to announce that new mortgage loans had jumped 40% in October from the previous month to 348.1 billion yuan ($54.5 billion). However, the amount was just 7% higher than the monthly average in the first nine months of the year. 
""We're making flexible adjustments in line with the market situation, but the general direction will not change,"" said Zong Liang, chief researcher at Bank of China, one of the country's biggest state lenders. 
""Our goal is very clear - we want to maintain steady development of the property market, and our policy adjustments are based on the economic situation,"" he told Reuters. 
Some lenders had held back issuance of home loans earlier in the year, wary of being accused of fuelling debt bubbles as regulators were cracking down on new borrowing by developers, the bankers said.
""There is no increase in (loan) quotas, but the pace of loan disbursement has been picking up,"" said a banker at a state lender in Shanghai.
In early September, China's banking watchdog said banks should offer financial support for home buyers with ""rigid"" demand, referring to those recently married or seeking low-cost housing. 
Banks should implement differentiated mortgage polices and down-payment requirements, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission also said at the time, avoiding inflexible rules that penalise non-speculative, legitimate home buyers.
""We hope to maintain steady and sustainable development of the property sector, and do not want excessive tightening or one-size-fits-all tightening to affect normal business activities and normal property developers,"" Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, told Reuters on Thursday.

""Now, we are trying to correct over-tightening. We should ensure normal start and completion of projects, otherwise there could be impact on home buyers and suppliers.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, rebounding after the inflation-induced losses of Wednesday despite a disappointing update from entertainment giant  Disney .
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 60 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 107 points, or 0.7%.
The three major indices closed lower Wednesday, after U.S. consumer prices rose the most in 31 years, stoking fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced into raising interest rates sooner than previously expected. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240 points, or 0.7%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite suffered the most, falling 1.7%.
The driving force behind Wednesday’s losses was the U.S. consumer price index rising 6.2% in the 12 months through October, the highest annual rate of inflation since November 1990. The rise in prices was both broad-based and higher than expected on a monthly basis.
Activity could be muted Thursday with the bond market shut for Veterans Day.
Investor focus will mostly likely fall on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), after the entertainment and media conglomerate reported the smallest rise in Disney+ subscriptions since it launched the streaming video service to take on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Its theme park division fell well short of projections, despite reopening after the pandemic. 
 Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) is also likely to be stay in the spotlight, the day after the aspiring electric vehicle maker recorded gains of more than 29% on its debut, after raising $12 billion in its IPO. It was the biggest IPO in the U.S. since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in 2014, and the biggest by a U.S. company since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in 2012.
Additionally, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will remain in the spotlight after SEC filings showed CEO Elon Musk has sold around 4.5 million shares over the course of three days, around one-third of the stake sale he indicated was likely on Sunday.
Crude prices weakened Thursday, continuing the previous session’s losses on concerns the sharp rise in U.S. inflation, boosted by high energy costs, will prompt the Biden administration to release more strategic stockpiles.
President Joe Biden said he asked the National Economic Council to work to reduce energy costs, which may result in further SPR releases.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",Sika to buy former BASF chemicals company from Lone Star for $6 billion,"By John Revill and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss chemicals company Sika has agreed to buy MBCC Group for 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($6 billion) to boost its position in sustainable building, making its biggest ever acquisition in the fragmented $70 billion construction chemicals sector.
Sika said on Thursday it was buying MBCC, the former BASF Construction Chemicals, from an affiliate of private equity firm Lone Star Funds. MBCC's products include long-lasting flooring systems and admixtures to extend the life of concrete.
""Going forward, we need products for ... a sustainable, CO2-reduced footprint in the construction industry. For this, we cannot just modify what we have been doing in the past,"" Chief Executive Thomas Hasler told a press conference in Zurich.
Sika has identified sustainability as a major driver in the construction market, as building users seek to extend the life-span of their offices and factories and use materials with lower carbon footprints.
Its shares were up 9.8% by 1143 GMT as analysts welcomed the projected boost to sales and core earnings (EBITDA) from the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022.
The deal ""will add about 30% to Sika's topline and 25% to its EBITDA, thereby making it the undisputed global market leader in construction chemicals,"" Vontobel analysts said.
MBCC, based in Mannheim, Germany, expects 2021 sales of 2.9 billion Swiss francs.
The move for MBCC represents a step change for Sika, which has already bought seven small companies in China, Mexico, the United States, Japan, Brazil and Russia this year.
Sika, whose products are used in areas such as waterproofing, is stepping up acquisitions, aiming to increase its share of the construction chemicals market from around 10% now to 12% by 2025.
It expects that market to increase to around 80 billion francs per year by 2025 from 70 billion francs currently, with government stimulus programmes and trends towards more sustainable building fuelling a global infrastructure boom.
Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer was surprised Sika was buying the former BASF business for a 64% uplift to the price Lone Star paid in 2019, after Sika had at the time flagged several weak points of the business.
""To turn around the weak spots of MBCC will be one of the most challenging tasks for Sika,"" Mayer said. ""In contrast, the integration track record of Sika is very strong and therefore if anyone can turn around the business it might be Sika.""
The deal represents a multiple of 11.5 times MBCC's expected 2022 EBITDA, Sika said. Sika expects to achieve synergies of 160–180 million francs, bringing the multiple down to 8.5.
It will finance the deal, which it expects to be ""strongly accretive"" to earnings per share from the first full year after closing, with a bridge loan.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) advised Sika on the deal.

News Briefs
‘A New Dimension’
Before the year is over, Elon Musk wants to start production at Tesla’s new electric-vehicle factory outside Berlin. While he’s cautioned that ramping up Model Y output at the facility in the small town of Gruenheide will be challenging, the development is the talk of the German auto industry nonetheless.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess last week urged his German workforce to brace for more radical changes as the company tries to keep pace with Tesla, which aims to eventually churn out 500,000 EVs a year at Gruenheide. The new factory will probably take 10 hours to assemble an EV, compared with the more than 30 hours it takes VW.
“Tesla will enter a new dimension in Europe with this new location,” said Diess, who has a mildly awkward “frenemy” relationship with Musk.
The VW empire is gearing up to strike back. VW may build a new EV factory at its sprawling Wolfsburg headquarters to make some 250,000 cars a year. It’s also planning to design a new battery-powered model, code-named “Trinity,” that’s supposed to close the technology gap to Tesla, including with regard to automated-driving functions.
“We’re in the midst of a major transformation in which we have to drastically change course,” Diess said Wednesday during an auto conference in Germany. “Wolfsburg is getting ready to meet the new competition.”
Diess’s image as the bold innovator pushing to overhaul the German industrial juggernaut has suffered somewhat in recent weeks. The CEO has clashed with labor leaders over the extent of the overhaul, which contributed to VW pushing back its annual investment review by a month to December. Diess should better focus on some of the legacy issues plaguing the carmaker — like the 40 billion euros of unfunded pension liabilities — and consider ditching his Tesla fixation, according to Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois.
“Diess’s constant Tesla references have become counterproductive, highlighting vulnerabilities rather than imaginative solutions,” Houchois wrote in a report Monday, in which he downgraded VW shares to the equivalent of a sell rating.
BMW is discussing Tesla’s prospects very differently. The luxury-car maker’s CEO, Oliver Zipse, painstakingly avoided even uttering the carmaker’s name when asked about the U.S. rival.
Speaking at the same conference as Diess, Zipse fired a broadside at Tesla, saying BMW differs from the U.S. rival on “standard on quality and reliability,” and adding that the German company has “different aspirations on customer satisfaction.” He’s thrown shade at Tesla before, saying in February that the company’s years-long dominance of EV sales may soon end as traditional automakers introduce a slew of their own new battery-powered cars. 
So far, that prediction looks off-base. The Model 3 was Europe’s top-selling car in September, beating out even mass-market combustion-engine models.
Given that Tesla took that sales crown largely with cars imported from its Shanghai factory, the prospect of a working plant near Berlin will surely keep the company squarely in the discussions Diess, Zipse and their fellow European auto executives have about the state of the industry and their companies for the foreseeable future.
Before You Go
Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) on Thursday took the wraps off the Solterra, its first all-electric SUV, which the company jointly developed with Toyota. The automaker will market the model in the U.S., Canada, Europe, China and Japan by the middle of next year. CEO Tomomi Nakamura said early last year that Subaru didn’t see much evidence Americans want EVs or plug-in hybrids. The company nonetheless is aiming for 40% of its global sales to be electrified by 2030. By 2035, it wants all sales to be hybrids or EVs.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>","Aegon, other insurers hit by U.S. COVID-19 deaths in third quarter","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch insurer Aegon (NYSE:AEG) NV reported a 16% fall in third- quarter operating profit on Thursday due to higher COVID-19 related mortality claims in the Americas, the latest European insurer to suffer from new waves of the pandemic.
Aegon, which does two-thirds of its business in the United States, said ""unfavourable mortality claims"" in the Americas in the third quarter were $111 million, up from $31 million a year earlier.
""Performance improvements across most of our businesses ... were offset by elevated mortality in the United States,"" Aegon Chief Executive Lard Friese in a statement. 
Among other European insurers, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said its life and health division incurred ""significantly higher COVID-19 related claims of $1.2 billion"" in the first nine months of 2021 ""primarily originating in the U.S."". CEO John Dacey cited U.S. spikes in February and August.
Munich Re also saw a higher than expected COVID impact in its results earlier this week. 
U.S. firm MetLife (NYSE:MET) was hit at its domestic life operations in generally strong third-quarter earnings. 
It said that in the third quarter, 40% of U.S. COVID-19 deaths were of people under 65 years old, ""the highest percentage in any quarter since the pandemic began"". 
In a note, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said that the world's biggest reinsurance companies bear the lion's share of COVID-19 losses as they have ""triple exposure"" through Property & Casualty and Life reinsurance businesses, as well as through primary P&C businesses. 
Aegon's 443 million euros ($512 million) operating profit for July-September compared a forecast of 490 million euros in a poll of analysts compiled by Aegon.
Friese added Aegon's fee and investment income were up and the company was meeting other performance targets.
Aegon shares, which were up 34% this year at their 4.31 euro close on Wednesday, were down nearly 2% at 4.228 euros at 1135 GMT on Thursday.

Investing.com – Rivian stock (NASDAQ:RIVN) is looking at another day of gains Thursday after it rose more than 29% on its debut in another emphatic endorsement of the transition to electric mobility by investors.
The stock climbed as much as 9% in premarket trading as market players continue to pile into companies promising a cleaner future even though they are yet to make a profit or, in Rivian's case, revenue. It subsequently pared those gains to around 6.0%.
The maker of electric delivery vans and pickup trucks raised $12 billion via the IPO to expand production and speed development of new models.
The issue price was set at $78 and the company was valued at almost $86 billion at the end of its first day as a listed company, just a few million dollars less than General Motors (NYSE:GM) and more than its shareholder Ford's (NYSE:F) $77-billion tag. It still has some way to go to catch up Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which, at over $1 trillion, is worth more than all the other top automakers of the world combined.
The global auto industry has sharply pivoted to electric vehicles in recent years as limate change becomes more adverse and world opinion turns against use of fossil fuels.  "
811,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>","Delivery Hero upbeat on revenues, decided against Wolt offer","By Linda Pasquini and Milla Nissi
(Reuters) -Delivery Hero on Thursday nudged its 2021 revenue outlook up towards the upper end of its previous forecast, as the online takeaway food company benefits from its ongoing investments in food delivery and so-called quick commerce.
The German group has grown rapidly during the coronavirus crisis and has invested heavily in highly competitive quick commerce, which aims to deliver goods in as little as 10 to 15 minutes.
The boom in home delivery demand during the pandemic has attracted more companies into the business, which is already starting to spur a consolidation wave. 
U.S. rival DoorDash this week said it would buy Finland-based Wolt in a acquisition valued at about 7 billion euros.
Delivery Hero CEO Niklas Oestberg said the group had also been involved in the process leading up to the deal, but had decided against making an offer.
Oestberg said the deal would not have a material impact on Delivery Hero, as the company's European operations are ""relatively small"", under 7% of its business.
Delivery Hero now expects to report 2021 revenue and gross merchandise volume at the upper end of its earlier forecast ranges, as it stepped up the number of Dmarts - centrally located dedicated warehouses that cater only to online clients - to 861 from 704 at the end of June. , 
""The growth in the number of Dmarts is impressive and a statement of intent around the sector's hottest theme,"" a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst said.
Delivery Hero shares were up 2.6% at 0934 GMT, topping the German blue-chip index.
DOORDASH-WOLT DEAL
Oestberg noted the DoorDash deal with Wolt could affect some other European players, pointing to the price tag as a sign that other U.S.-based groups may expand into the market.
""We looked into the numbers but we decided not to participate in an offer, as we understood that the price expectation was way beyond what we could actually pay,"" Oestberg said.
""We've been trying to focus on being number one in our markets,"" he said, adding that Wolt would not materially change the story.

Delivery Hero decided earlier this year to relaunch operations in Germany, stepping up competition in the home market it quit three years ago to focus on Asia, which makes up about 50% of revenues.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Global luxury sales set to outpace pre-COVID levels this year, Bain says","PARIS (Reuters) - The luxury goods sector is set to move past the coronavirus crisis this year, fuelled by domestic spending in the United States and China, particularly on high end shoes, leather goods and jewellery, consultancy Bain said on Thursday.
Bain estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will reach 283 billion euros ($327 billion) this year, bouncing back from the crisis with a 4% increase, at constant exchange rates, compared to 2019, before the pandemic hit.
Business in the United States, which this year overtook Europe as the largest market, was boosted by early vaccination campaigns and a quick rebound in local consumption. Demand in China, the growth engine of the luxury industry, remained strong through October despite lockdowns in some areas, as the Chinese -- unable to travel abroad -- made purchases in their home market.
In Europe, business has yet to return to pre-COVID levels, and may take until 2024 to do so, despite a pick up in tourist activity over the summer, added Bain, whose forecasts are closely watched by the luxury industry.
The largest players in the industry, like LVMH, Hermes and Kering have already recovered strongly from the health crisis, pushing well above 2019 levels of business as lockdowns ease and socialising resumes. 
Due to the pandemic, overall sales for the sector fell by 23% in 2020, their largest-ever drop and first decline since 2009. 
Although sales linked to international travel have not returned, brands brought on new business by focusing on catering to consumers domestically, not only in top luxury hubs but also in second and third-tier cities. A quarter of global sales this year were made with new consumers, according to Bain estimates.
""Brands are attracting a new customer base with strong marketing and online campaigns, while existing customers are buying more"" said Bain partner Federica Levato, who co-authored the study. 
Shoppers under 40 are expected to account for more than 60% of luxury purchases this year and more than 70% by

2025.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) was Thursday looking to add to its previous day’s gains as the dust over Elon Musk’s $5-billion sale of shares settles.
The stock was up 4% premarket after closing 4.3% higher Wednesday.
The block sale by Tesla's CEO had dragged the electric vehicle maker’s market value below $1 trillion, a milestone it only recently achieved, as the market absorbed the sudden increase in supply.  The rout also shaved a substantial sum off Musk's paper wealth, given that most of it is accounted for by his remaining holdings of Tesla stock. Tesla regained its trillion-dollar valuation Wednesday.  
After selling less than 1% of his holding Monday, Musk sold about 2% over the next two days, according to regulatory notices. He sold around 4.5 million shares in all, more than what he bought through exercising the options. 
The sale comes days after Musk took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on November 7 to seek his followers’ vote on whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. He framed the question as a response to recent proposals from Democratic lawmakers to tax unrealized stock gains, as a way to fund their deadlocked spending bill. Musk would have had to pay a large tax bill on his newly acquired stock irrespective of the Twitter poll.  However, that appears to have been covered - and then some - by the stock sale.
Musk has more than 20 million further stock options that are due to expire in August of next year, according to Reuters.

By Simon Jessop, William James and Shadia Nasralla
GLASGOW (Reuters) - Swedish automaker Volvo Cars said on Wednesday it had set a price on carbon emissions from its operations of 1,000 Swedish crowns ($116.30) a tonne, part of attempts to ensure all future projects are sustainable.
Announcing the move at global climate talks in Scotland as it joined an imitative to phase out fossil fuel cars and vans, the company said it had deliberately set a relatively high price to ""future proof"" itself.
Negotiators at the COP26 talks are trying to finish rules to create an international carbon market. Put simply, it would allow some countries to pay others to cut emissions - with the aim of pushing much-needed cash into green projects around the world.
Volvo Cars said it was the first automaker to set such a price across its whole operations, as part of its aim to be a climate neutral company by 2040. The price is double the current cost of carbon in the European Union's carbon trading scheme.
Going forward, every new car project would go through a ""sustainability sense-check"", with a carbon price assigned throughout the life of the vehicle, to ensure it would be profitable even under a much higher government-set price.
""A global and fair price on CO2 is critical for the world to meet its climate ambitions, and we all need to do more,"" Björn Annwall, chief financial officer, said in a statement.
""We strongly believe progressive companies should take the lead by setting an internal carbon price. By evaluating future cars on their CO2-adjusted profitability, we expect to accelerate actions that will help us identify and reduce carbon emissions already today.""

Also on Wednesday, Volvo Cars signed up to the Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, along with peers including Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM), aiming to end production of internal combustion engines by 2040.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Siemens expects supply chain problems that have hindered the industrial revival in the wake of the pandemic to ease next year, the engineering and technology company said on Thursday, as its fourth quarter sales and orders beat forecasts.
The maker of factory software and high-speed trains sees further profitable growth as problems thrown up by shortages of components and log-jammed logistics networks improve.
Siemens was leaning on its size and its own technology to get enough components to make its machinery and systems which are used by carmakers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) to automate production lines, Chief Executive Roland Busch said .
""Knock on wood, we have come through the situation very well. As a result, we've been able to keep deliveries at a high level,"" Busch told reporters.
""We pool demand for raw materials and components, which ensures our ranking as a relevant partner for more than 1,500 strategic suppliers,"" he added. ""We have very good relations with our suppliers.""
Like Swiss rival ABB, Siemens has been managing a shortage of semi conductor chips and higher raw materials prices as recovering global demand has outstripped suppliers' ability to keep up.
Siemens was also raising prices to offset higher raw material, labour and component costs, something it was confident of being able to pass on to customers.
Still, the Munich company said it expects delivery times for its products to be extended, at least in the next six months, due to its big order backlog and shortages.
During the three months to the end of September, Siemens's sales rose 18% to 17.44 billion euros ($20.17 billion), surpassing analysts' forecast of 16.82 billion.
Orders rose 26% to 19.07 billion euros, ahead of expectations for 17.56 billion, it added.
But profit was held back by one-off gains reported a year earlier. Adjusted operating profit from its industrial business fell 14% to 2.27 billion euros, missing a forecast of 2.45 billion. Net income declined 29% to 1.33 billion euros.
For its 2022 business year, Siemens said it expected mid-single-digit comparable revenue growth, net of currency translation and changes to its portfolio of companies.
Analysts described the quarterly figures as strong, highlighting the company's order growth and outlook. Siemens's stock was trading 2% higher in mid-morning activity.
Busch, who took control from longstanding predecessor Joe Kaeser in October 2020, was ""very optimistic"" about benefiting from the recently agreed $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure stimulus package.
The announced split of U.S. rival  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) into three separate companies however did not put Siemens under any pressure to act, he added. Siemens has already separated its health equipment and energy businesses.

""I see no reason at all to change anything in our strategy,"" Busch said. ""We have taken the steps - from a position of strength - that GE is now following.
""We are not a conglomerate, we are a focused technology group.""

(Reuters) -British fashion chain Ted Baker said on Thursday sales were rebounding as office and party wear become popular again after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, but signalled that the pace of recovery was still uncertain.
Ted Baker and other apparel retailers are navigating a bumpy road back to normal as demand for office and party wear grows again, but anaemic levels of tourism in places such as London had hurt store footfall.
""We are optimistic but we're also being reasonably cautious on outlook in the next quarter and the next year,"" Chief Executive Rachel Osborne said in an interview. ""For us, a full return to international tourism would really help the bounce back.""
Ted Baker, which has 377 stores and concessions with three-quarters of those located in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America, said demand for formal wear, suiting and occasion wear pushed group revenue up 18% year-over-year in the 28 weeks to Aug. 14. Loss before tax narrowed to 25.3 million pounds ($34.2 million) from 86.4 million a year earlier.
The rising number of COVID-19 vaccinations in Europe and North America has encouraged many workers back to return to their offices, with Ted Baker's revenue from North America jumping by a third. Customers looking ahead to parties and the Christmas season were also helping, Osborne said.
Shares in the upmarket retailer were up 5.3% at 143.9 pence by 0905 GMT.
Group revenues were, however, still down 36% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, suggesting a longer road to recovery.
""Within our store portfolio there have been clear changes in footfall patterns and there is uncertainty over the timing and degree of the return to previous patterns,"" Osborne said in a statement.
The upmarket retailer is now half-way through a three-year turnaround that was launched by Osborne and is focused on cost cuts and boosting its online presence and product range.
It has also been working to repair its image after former boss Ray Kelvin left in 2019 following misconduct allegations. Kelvin, who started the company in 1988 in Glasgow in Scotland, has denied the allegations.
Ted Baker did not provide annual financial forecasts but said it was ""comfortable"" with current analyst expectations for the financial year.

Third-quarter group revenue - for the 12 weeks to Nov. 6 - also jumped by 18%, the company said.

Investing.com – Disney stock (NYSE:DIS) traded 5% lower in Thursday’s premarket as user growth at its streaming service Disney+ cooled off more than anticipated, causing the company to miss both sales and earnings estimates in its fiscal fourth quarter.
Last year was a record for streaming services as people stayed home and binge watched in the pandemic. A bit of cooling was expected as economies reopened but the slowdown in streaming growth still came as an unpleasant surprise.
Disney+ gained 2.1 million customers during the quarter ended October 2 to close at around 118 million globally, missing expectations of over 124 million. Average monthly revenue per subscriber fell 9% to $4.12. Net subscriber additions at its other streaming services, ESPN+ and Hulu, also fell short of expectations. 
Walt  Disney  management indicated it expects the slowdown to be temporary and reiterated its goal of 260 million customers by 2024. 
Losses in the direct-to-consumer business, which also includes ESPN+ and Hulu, widened to $630 million as the world’s largest entertainment company spent heavily on content and promotions. Higher costs of sports programming and marketing at ESPN+ also contributed to the losses, as did the delayed restart of the Indian Premier League cricket tournament, although the service managed to grow its average revenue per user. Hulu also grew its ARPUs.
Disney reported fourth-quarter earnings of 37 cents a share on revenue of around $19 billion.
Theme parks, which were especially hard hit by the pandemic last year, swung sharply back to a profit of $640 million. 
The movie studio business posted a loss of $65 million in the period, however, as higher marketing costs and other expenses for major releases like Scarlett Johansson-starrer ‘Black Widow’ and ‘Shang Chi’ took a toll.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) -RWE, Germany's largest power producer, posted a 6% rise in nine-month core profit, thanks in part to the non-core coal business that has come under investor pressure as part of global efforts to cut carbon emissions.
In the first nine months of the year RWE's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation reached 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion), up from 2.3 billion euros in the same period last year.
Shares in the group were flat at 0937 GMT after rising as much as 2.9%.
Core profit at its nuclear and coal division, which RWE says is not part of its core renewables and trading business, nearly doubled in the period, boosted by higher wholesale margins for lignite generation.
RWE has grown into one of Europe's top renewables players since a reorganisation of Germany's energy sector and it continues to operate coal and nuclear-fired power stations, which are being phased out as part of the country's energy shift.
Activist energy investor ENKRAFT has called on the company to separate its polluting lignite operations in a bid to cut emissions and remove a discount that has weighed on the stock as investors get more serious about dropping CO2-intense groups.
""RWE needs to sever ties with its lignite operations in order not to further hinder the future development of its core businesses,"" said ENKRAFT, which holds more than 500,000 shares in the company.
""RWE's Q3 results are yet another example of how its legacy operations mask the performance and development of its core businesses.""
RWE said it is on track to reach its goal of expanding green energy capacity to more than 13 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, with 3.8 GW currently under construction.
Lower average wind power volumes and the impact from a cold snap in Texas this year weighed on profits at RWE's renewables businesses. At the group's solar and wind operations, nine-month adjusted EBITDA was down 38%.

RWE, which is scheduled to hold a capital markets day on Nov. 15, confirmed its outlook, saying it still expects adjusted EBITDA of 3 billion to 3.4 billion euros and a dividend of 0.90 euros per share.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) -NASA and private rocket company SpaceX launched four astronauts into orbit late on Wednesday, sending a veteran spacewalker, two younger crewmates chosen for future lunar missions and a German materials scientist on their way to the International Space Station.
The SpaceX-built launch vehicle, consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule and a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, blasted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at about 9 p.m. (0200 GMT Thursday), with a reddish fireball lighting up the night sky as its nine Merlin engines roared to life.
The liftoff of the Dragon spacecraft, named Endurance by the crew, was aired live from Cape Canaveral on NASA TV, punctuated by the sound of cheers and applause from mission controllers. Intermittent rain and clouds over the Cape earlier in the day had cast doubt on launch prospects, but the weather cleared by flight time, NASA said.
The mission had been confounded by a string of weather delays since its original launch window on Oct. 31. One postponement earlier this month was attributed to an astronaut's unspecified medical issue, although NASA said the problem was later resolved.
Live video footage webcast by NASA showed the four crew members strapped into the pressurized cabin of their capsule and seated calmly in their helmeted white-and-black flight suits moments after a launch that appeared to go flawlessly.
Within 10 minutes of liftoff, the rocket's upper stage had delivered the crew capsule into orbit, according to launch commentators. Meanwhile, the rocket's reusable lower stage, having detached from the rest of the spacecraft, flew itself back to Earth and successfully touched down on a landing platform floating on a drone vessel in the Atlantic.
'HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE RIDE'
As the Dragon separated from the upper rocket stage moments later, a launch engineer on the ground radioed to the crew: ""Welcome to orbit. Hope you enjoyed the ride. Dragon will take you from here. Safe travels.""
The three American astronauts and their European Space Agency crewmate were due to arrive at the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth, on Thursday evening following a flight of about 22 hours.
The flight marks the third ""operational"" space station crew sent to orbit aboard a Dragon capsule since NASA and SpaceX teamed up to resume space launches from American soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011.
""Crew 3"" includes two members of NASA's latest graduating class of astronauts - Raja Chari, 44, a U.S. Air Force combat jet and test pilot serving as mission commander, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34, a U.S. Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer.
The team's designated pilot and second-in-command is veteran astronaut Tom Marshburn, 61, a medical doctor and former NASA flight surgeon who has logged two previous spaceflights to the space station and four spacewalks. Rounding out the crew is European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, of Germany, a materials science engineer. 
BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE
Chari, Maurer and Barron were all making their debut spaceflights with Wednesday's launch, becoming the 599th, 600th and 601st humans in space. 
Both Chari and Barron also are among the first group of 18 astronauts selected for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions, aimed at returning humans to the moon later this decade, over a half century after the Apollo lunar program ended.
NASA has extolled space station missions in low-Earth orbit as critical training grounds and incubators for technologies that will help achieve the goals of a sustainable lunar presence and eventual human flights to Mars. 
With the Crew Dragon flying autonomously through space at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,360 kmph), the four astronauts were expected to have a meal and get some sleep before arriving at the space station to begin a six-month science mission aboard the orbiting laboratory.
The launch stands as SpaceX's fifth crewed flight overall in 17 months, and the fourth under NASA's public-private partnership with the rocket company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc 
The first was a two-astronaut trial run to the space station in May 2020, followed by the maiden NASA-SpaceX operational ""Crew 1"" in November of that year.
""Crew 2"" flew to the space station in April of this year, and just returned safely to Earth on Monday night with a splash-down capping a record 199 days in orbit.

The latest mission also follows a flurry of recent high-profile astro-tourism flights, including the SpaceX launch in September of ""Inspiration 4,"" the first all-civilian crew sent to orbit without a professional astronaut on board.
The ""Crew 3"" team, on arriving at the space station, will be welcomed aboard by its three current occupants - two cosmonauts from Russia and Belarus and a U.S. astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to orbit earlier this year.

GLASGOW (Reuters) - A group of countries, companies and cities committed on Wednesday to phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles by 2040, as part of efforts to cut carbon emissions and curb global warming.
But the world's top two carmakers,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), as well as major car markets China, the United States and Germany, did not sign up, highlighting the challenges in shifting to zero emissions.
The Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, unveiled at climate talks https://www.reuters.com/business/cop in the Scottish city, sees the groups pledge to ""rapidly"" accelerate the transition to low-carbon emission vehicles, aiming to green leading markets by 2035.
Headline signatories included Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM), the world's second-most populous country India and major corporate purchasers of vehicles including Leaseplan, which rents 1.7 million cars in 30 countries.
Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, said the absence of the major economies and producers was ""gravely concerning"".
""To stop new fossil fuels, we need to cut off our dependency,"" he said. That means moving on from combustion engines towards electric vehicles and creating clean public transport networks without delay.""
A German environment ministry spokesman said the country's government would not sign on Wednesday as it had not reached internal consensus on a ""marginal aspect"" of the pledge concerning whether fuels made from renewable energy but burned in a combustion engine could form part of the solution.
Cars, trucks, ships, buses and planes account for about a quarter of all global carbon emissions, data from the International Energy Agency showed, mostly from road vehicles.  
Others who did sign up included Sweden's Volvo Cars,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz, China's BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd and Jaguar Land Rover, a unit of India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd.
Other countries signing up included New Zealand and Poland, joining a number of nations already committed to ensuring all new cars and vans are zero emission by 2040 or earlier, including Britain, host of the COP26 summit.
Among other leading companies and cities on board are ride-hailing company Uber (NYSE:UBER) and food retailer Sainsbury's, the South Korean capital Seoul and Brazil's Sao Paolo. 
As countries look to agree a way to price carbon globally, Volvo Cars, which has already committed to going fully electric by 2030, said separately it would assume a carbon price of 1,000 Swedish crowns on all future projects.
CHINA
The commitment comes on a day dedicated to transport at the conference, where policymakers are looking to accelerate efforts to cap global warming by mid-century. 
But the apparent unwillingness of China, the world's largest car market, and the United States - the world's largest economy and second-largest car market - to join the pledge raises questions about its effectiveness.
While the United States is not on board, key car-buying states like California and New York are.
An industry source said some carmakers are wary of the pledge because it commits them to a costly shift in technology, but lacks a similar commitment from governments to ensure that the necessary charging and grid infrastructure would be built.
The European Commission has proposed an effective ban on fossil-fuel vehicles by 2035, accompanied by a commitment to a charging infrastructure demanded by carmakers.

The world's No. 4 carmaker, Stellantis, was also missing from Wednesday's pledge, as were Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd; Germany's BMW and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",Toshiba's lurch from crisis to crisis since 2015,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp plans to unveil a new business strategy on Friday. The once-storied conglomerate has been battered by accounting scandals, massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business, the sale of its prized chip unit and it was also found to have colluded to prevent overseas investors from gaining influence.
Here is a timeline of Toshiba' woes since 2015.
2015 - Toshiba discloses accounting malpractices across multiple divisions, which involved top management. In total, it overstated its pretax profit by 230 billion yen ($2 billion) over seven years.
Dec. 2016 - Toshiba flags it will take a charge of several billion dollars in relation to a nuclear power plant construction company that its U.S. unit, Westinghouse Electric, had bought a year earlier.
March 2017 - Westinghouse files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to billions of dollars in cost overruns and years-long delays at U.S. power projects. Faced with over $6 billion in liabilities linked to Westinghouse, Toshiba decides to put its prized chip unit, Toshiba Memory, up for sale.
Sept. 2017 - Toshiba agrees to sell the chip unit to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion, a deal under which Toshiba retains a large stake. Worried it could be delisted for having liabilities exceed assets for a second straight year, Toshiba is desperate to close the deal by the end of the financial year in March. But it is caught up in a prolonged legal dispute with chip joint venture partner  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) over the sale and antitrust reviews are expected to take months.
Dec. 2017 - Toshiba secures a $5.4 billion cash injection from 30-plus overseas investors that helps it avoid a delisting but brings in prominent activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) and Farallon. It settles the dispute with Western Digital.
April 2018 - Toshiba seeks to turn a new page by bringing in an outsider - Nobuaki Kurumatani, a former executive at Toshiba's main creditor Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group - as chief executive.
June 2018 - Toshiba completes the sale of Toshiba Memory, renamed Kioxia, to the Bain consortium.
June 2019 - Bowing to pressure from activist investors, Toshiba invites four non-Japanese directors to its board.
Jan. 2020 - Toshiba finds fresh accounting irregularities at a wholly owned subsidiary.
July 2020 - Five director candidates nominated by activist shareholders seeking to improve governance and change strategy are voted down at Toshiba's annual general meeting.
Sept. 2020 - Toshiba discloses more than 1,000 postal voting forms for its AGM went uncounted. The bank that counted the votes, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, later reveals widespread failure to count all valid votes at AGMs of its client firms over the past two decades.
March 2021 - Shareholders approve an independent investigation into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of the previous year's AGM.
April 2021 - CVC Capital Partners makes an unsolicited $21 billion offer to take Toshiba private. A week later, CEO Kurumatani resigns amid controversy over the CVC bid, which was perceived by some within company management as designed to shield him from activist shareholders. Toshiba's subsequent dismissal of the CVC offer, however, angers some activist shareholders.
June 10, 2021 - The shareholder-commissioned investigation concludes Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees Toshiba as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at the 2020 shareholders meeting.
June 25, 2021 - Shareholders oust board chairman Osamu Nagayama after critics accuse the board of failing to address the allegations about pressuring overseas investors. Toshiba pledges to undertake a full review of assets and engage with potential investors.

Nov. 12, 2021 - Toshiba to announce a new business strategy. It is considering splitting into three companies focused separately on infrastructure, devices and memory chips, which could address the firm's persistent conglomerate discount.

LONDON (Reuters) - British discount retailer B&M has good stock availability heading into the Christmas trading season, having deliberately taken delivery of imported general merchandise earlier than normal, it said on Thursday.
The country's retailers have been grappling with delays in international supply chains, compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks.
But B&M, which sells everything from food to homewares, gardening and DIY products, said supply chains across the group remain robust.
""We have responded decisively to supply chain challenges by leveraging our strong supplier relationships and we have improved in-store execution,"" said CEO Simon Arora.
""As a consequence, we are fully stocked heading into the golden quarter,"" he added, referring to the peak trading period.
Prior to Thursday's update, shares in B&M had risen more than 29% this year. 
However, the shares were down 6.6% at 0836 GMT on Thursday after the company reported like-for-like sales at the core B&M UK business down 8.9% year on year in the first six weeks of its third quarter, reflecting ""highly elevated"" sales in the same period last year owing to unusually early Christmas trading.
The group, the full name of which is B&M European Value Retail, said revenue for the six months to Sept. 25 rose 1.2% to 2.27 billion pounds ($3.1 billion), with B&M UK's like-for-like sales down 5%.
First-half group adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 282.2 million pounds in the six months to Sept. 25, down 4.6%.
B&M is paying an interim dividend of 5 pence per share, up 16.3%.

""Like the retail sector as a whole, the group faces a number of potential cost headwinds and inflationary pressures heading into 2022 but considers itself well positioned to navigate these challenges,"" the company said.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, boosted by generally strong corporate earnings but amid caution following the sharp rise in U.S. inflation.
At 4:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%.
The European quarterly earnings season continued in full flow Thursday, with most corporates releasing generally positive results.
Generali (MI:GASI) stock rose 1.5% after Italy's top insurer beat market expectations with its nine-month results and said it has about 1 billion euros left to deploy for M&A opportunities.
 Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) stock rose 1% after reporting better-than-expected sales and orders during its fourth quarter, with the German engineering giant overcoming ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) stock rose 0.9% after the British insurer said it was on track to return at least 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) to shareholders, while Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) stock rose 1.5% after the German online takeaway food company lifted its 2021 revenue outlook to the upper end of a previous forecast.
On the flip side,  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) stock slumped 7.9% after the British luxury brand said that sales in Europe remained under pressure from reduced tourist levels, even after announcing strong growth in mainland China, South Korea and the United States. 
On Wednesday, U.S. consumer price index surged 6.2% on an annual basis last month, climbing at the fastest pace since 1990, boosting the case for faster Federal Reserve policy tightening.
The tone is more circumspect in Europe as the region’s central bank is seen as being way behind the Fed in terms of reining in its accommodative monetary policy stance. Only last week President Christine Lagarde stated that the European Central Bank is very unlikely to raise interest rates next year as inflation remains too low.
Elsewhere, U.K. gross domestic product grew by 1.3%, the weakest three-month growth since Britain was under lockdown in early 2021. The country’s economy remained 2.1% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, a bigger shortfall than in fellow Group of Seven countries Germany, Italy and France.
Crude prices edged higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s losses on concerns the sharp rise in U.S. inflation, boosted by high energy costs, will prompt the Biden administration to release more strategic stockpiles.
Inventories of gasoline and distillates continued to fall, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, while crude stockpiles rose just over 1 million barrels, after the government released 3.1 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
President Joe Biden said he asked the National Economic Council to work to reduce energy costs, which may result in further SPR releases.   
By 4:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $81.56 a barrel, having dropped 3.3% on Wednesday, while the Brent contract gained 0.6% to $83.12, after fallen 2.5% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,864.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1465.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk sold about $5 billion in shares, the billionaire reported in filings on Wednesday, just days after he polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about selling 10% of his stake.
In his first share sale since 2016, Musk's trust sold nearly 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4 billion, while he also sold another 934,000 shares for $1.1 billion after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares.
The 4.5 million shares equate to about 3% of his total holdings in the electric vehicle manufacturer, which makes up the vast part of his estimated $281.6 billion fortune, according to Forbes.
Musk on Saturday polled Twitter users about selling 10% of his stake, helping to push down Tesla's share price after a majority on Twitter said they agreed with the sale.
The stock sank 12% on Tuesday in a multi-day selloff that endangered the company's position in the $1 trillion club, but recovered 4.3% on Wednesday.
The options-related sales were set up in September through a trading plan that allows corporate insiders to establish preplanned transactions on a schedule, the filing said. The sales of the option-related shares paid for associated taxes. It was not clear how or whether the trading plan related to Musk's Twitter poll. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The additional share sales were separate and provide Musk with sizeable reserves of cash, given his wealth is largely tied to his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.
Musk has more than 20 million further stock options that are due to expire in August of next year. 
If Musk carried out the 10% stock sale plan, it would be a slight negative near term, said Mark Arnold, chief investment officer at Hyperion Asset Management in Brisbane where Tesla is the top holding in its global fund.
""But the stock is pretty liquid and its not a huge percentage of total issued shares, so it shouldn't have that much of an impact ... we're quite comfortable with the outlook for the business,"" he said.
While Tesla has lost close to $150 billion in market value this week, retail investors have been net buyers of the stock. Some 58% of Tesla trade orders on Fidelity's brokerage website on Wednesday were for purchases, rather than sales. 
Retail investors made net purchases of $157 million on Monday and Tuesday, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research.
Tesla is now up more than 51% in 2021, thanks largely to an October rally that was fueled by an agreement to sell 100,000 vehicles to rental car company Hertz.
""The company itself is on fire, with strong results,"" said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio strategist at New York-based investment management firm Ingalls and Snyder. 

Bullish sentiment returned to Tesla's options on Wednesday, with about 1.1 calls traded for every put. Calls are typically used for bullish trades, while buying puts shows a bearish bias.
The company's options accounted for about $109 billion in premium changing hands over the last two weeks, or about one in every three dollars traded in the U.S.-listed options market, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.

Coronavirus immigration curbs in Japan have led to a drop of about 95% in the number of passengers on international flights, but daily infections have dropped to fewer than 200 this month, from an August peak of more than 20,000.
""When we are able to make money we should be allowed to,"" Shinya Katanozaka, chief executive of the carrier that has had seven consecutive quarters of losses, told Reuters in an interview.
""It will give us the strength to weather things in the future."" 
Last December, as COVID-19 infections began to rise, Japan halted a programme of subsidies for hotels and travel tickets that had helped ANA and rival Japan Airlines Co. boost passenger numbers on domestic flights. 
The government could resume travel subsidies as soon as next month and ease entry limits for overseas visitors to 3,500 a day, Katanozaka said.

Last month, ANA increased its operating loss forecast for the year to March 31 more than four times, to 125 billion yen ($1.11 billion), and said it would cut worker headcount by a fifth over five years.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Zurich Insurance plans to raise its dividend and said it is confident of hitting its 2022 targets after property and casualty (P&C) premiums rose 11% on a like-for-like basis in the first nine months of 2021.
""It is certainly our intention to grow the dividend but I can't comment on precisely what will happen for this year,"" Chief Financial Officer George Quinn told reporters on a call.
Europe's fifth-largest insurer already returns 75% of what it makes to investors, he noted, playing down prospects of using its strong balance sheet to launch share buybacks as well.
""It is our preference to try and use that additional capital to actually support growth in new business which will eventually support growth in earnings which again will support growth in dividends. That's the priority for us,"" Quinn said.
Zurich's shares fell 2% in early trading, with analysts saying its solid delivery was nothing to move the stock higher.
P&C premiums swelled to $31.15 billion in the first nine months, a gain in dollar terms of 14%. 
These premiums continue to benefit from the improvement in the pricing environment and recent claims events were likely to extend the ""hard"" market, Quinn said in the results release that gave no profit figures. 
Major flooding in Germany, a series of other weather events in Europe in July, and Hurricane Ida in the United States hit home in the third quarter. Quinn said Ida alone would deliver a $450 million hit, and the flood claims would amount to $150-200 million, as previously forecast.
Zurich was making money despite catastrophe losses which are 3 to 4 percentage points higher than the long-term average.
In the first nine months, its life insurance new business annual premium equivalent (APE) rose 5% on a like-for-like basis that adjusts for currency movements, acquisitions and disposals.

""We continue to see areas of COVID-related excess mortality within Life, but the overall strength of the business allows this to be absorbed without having a material impact on the segment's financial results,"" it said.
Its Swiss Solvency Test (SST) capital ratio was estimated at 203%, well above its target of at least 160%, as of Sept. 30.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Eneos Holdings and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Thursday moved ahead with a tender offer for the 43% the refiner doesn't already own in roadbuilder Nippo Corp, shrugging off opposition from activist Oasis Management to a deal that values all of Nippo at more than $4 billion.
Nippo said in a statement that its board had agreed to the bid, and Eneos and Goldman will start a tender for shares on Friday that will run to Dec. 24.
Hong Kong-based Oasis, which has a 4.5% stake in Nippo, says the price, valuing Nippo at about at 476.4 billion yen ($4.2 billion), is too low and earlier this week said it had received assurances from Eneos, Japan's biggest refiner, and Nippo that they were open to alternative bids. 
Eneos President Katsuyuki Ota addressed that assertion on Thursday, speaking at an earnings conference shortly before Nippo issued its statement. Eneos and Goldman first announced in September they planned to take Nippo private. 
""Some shareholders have suggested that the ... price should be higher and we are communicating with them, but in the end, it is up to the independent committee of Nippo and the board committee to decide,"" Ota said. 
Oasis says the offer price of 4,000 yen ($35.37) apiece for Nippo shares undervalues a company with a pile of cash, securities and real estate worth more than $2 billion alone. 
Fair value is more like 5,600 yen per share, 28% higher than the Eneos-Goldman offer, it said earlier. The offer from Eneos and Goldman was at a 29% premium to Nippo's average price over the month before their announcement in September. 
Nippo shares fell 1.1% to 4,075 yen on Thursday, while Eneos slumped 2.5% against a wider market gain of 0.6%.
Nippo's ""share price is now about 4,000 yen, but before we started discussing this deal, it was around 3,000 yen and at the beginning of the year it was around 2,500 yen,"" Ota said. 
""So, we did proper due diligence and referred to other examples of (takeover) premiums,"" he said, adding ""I'm sure there will be many opinions, so we will communicate with them, but we think it is a reasonable proposal.""
If the tender is successful, the complicated series of transactions would see Eneos owning 50.1% of Nippo and Goldman the rest, with Goldman's stake potentially later rising to 75% through preference shares and options. 
""The buyers are entitled to launch their tender offer,"" Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer of Oasis told Reuters by email. ""The onus is on Nippo's Special Committee to speak to all interested bidders, as they have assured us they will."" 
Oasis previously aired complaints about majority shareholders in Japan steamrolling minority interests, echoing comments from minority investors in Japan over the years.
On Thursday, Ota also said that the bidders had received approval from overseas anti-trust regulators. 
Eneos said on Thursday its first-half earnings rose nearly six times to 211 billion yen ($1.9 billion) as rising prices for oil allowed it to book hefty valuation gains and demand for fuel slowly returned from the slumps of the pandemic.

Nippo, a 114-year old, Tokyo-based company that has turned making roads out of tar and gravel into a high-tech business, said its profit nearly halved to 7.6 billion yen.

LONDON (Reuters) -British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) is on track to return at least 4 billion pounds ($5.41 billion) to shareholders and meet cost saving targets, it said on Thursday, as activist investor Cevian pushes for higher returns.
Cevian took a 5% stake in Aviva this year and wants the insurer to return 5 billion pounds in capital to shareholders by the end of 2022 after a recent spate of international disposals.
Aviva said in August that it would return 4 billion pounds to shareholders, which Cevian said was insufficient.
""There are some different views out there from certain shareholders,"" Aviva finance chief Jason Windsor told Reuters, adding that the stakeholders remain ""very constructive"" in their interactions.
Aviva on Thursday said it had completed 450 million pounds of a 750 million pound share buyback. The remainder of the capital return - at least 3.25 billion pounds - is likely to take place in the second quarter of next year, Windsor said.
Aviva is also looking to build up its wealth advisory business, either through M&A (mergers and acquisitions) or organic growth, Windsor said, though a purchase would be for less than a billion pounds.
""It's the much smaller end of the spectrum - it's about a capability add-on to an already sucessful wealth business,"" he said. 
Aviva also said it was on course to achieve a savings target of 300 million pounds in 2022, relative to a 2018 baseline.
Cevian has said it believes there to be scope for further cost-cutting by the insurer, totalling at least 500 million pounds by 2023.
Net flows into Aviva's savings and retirement business rose 21% to record levels in the first nine months of the year while general insurance premiums rose 5%, it said in a statement.
Panmure Gordon analysts described the results as ""solid"" but said Aviva could return an additional 1 billion pounds to shareholders.

Aviva's shares, which have climbed 25% this year, were up 0.9% at 409.4 pence at 0842 GMT.

The world's largest producer of rough diamonds, which competes with  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) unit De Beers, is gradually restoring output after last year's 22% reduction to 30 million carats when global diamond sales were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Demand for diamond jewellery grew in double-digit percentages in the third quarter, said finance chief Alexey Philippovskiy, adding that global diamond output would remain 20–25% below the pre-pandemic levels in the coming years. 
Alrosa's third-quarter sales rose by 83% year on year to 9.2 million carats of diamonds.

The company is set to update the market on how it plans to use its available capital on Dec. 15 when it will unveil a new three-year strategic plan, finance chief Cristiano Borean said in a post-results media call. 
Chief Executive Philippe Donnet, whose term expires next April, has come under fire from two main shareholders - Italian businessmen Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio - who have criticised his M&A strategy as too timid and want Generali to grow further.
Generali earmarked up to 4 billion euros ($4.63 billion) for M&A under a three-year strategic plan ending this year. 
After a number of acquisitions in Portugal, Greece, eastern Europe and Malaysia, the insurer sealed last month a 1.17 billion euro takeover of smaller rival Cattolica in a move aimed at cementing its domestic market leadership.
""We are still evaluating any M&A opportunities consistent with our discipline. But M&A is not a must,"" Borean said, when asked if this capital could be also used for a share buyback.
Generali's nine-month net profit rose 74% to 2.25 billion euros ($2.60 billion), above the average forecast of 2.13 billion euros in an analyst consensus provided by the company.
Its shares have gained 35% this year and were up 1.6% in early trade on Thursday.
While its life and asset management businesses performed well, non-life business proved resilient despite the higher impact of natural catastrophe claims, the company said in a statement. 
Its operating profit, a figure most closely watched by the market, also came above analyst consensus as it rose 10% to 4.4 billion euros. Generali's solvency ratio, which measures the financial strength of the company, stood at 233% as of Nov. 8, up slightly from 231% at the end of July and 224% at the end of 2020. 

The insurer confirmed its target of annual compound growth in 2018-2021 of earnings per share of between 6% and 8%. Return on Equity (ROE) is expected to be higher than 11.5%.

But the London-based, South African owned company did not reinstate its dividend payout, which had been suspended for a year, saying it wanted to maintain its liquidity position.
Mediclinic, with hospitals in Southern Africa, Europe and Middle East, reported a headline earnings per share - the main measure of corporate profit in South Africa - of 8.8 pence, against 2.4 pence reported for the same period a year ago.
Hospital chains across the world saw their revenues hit in the last year and a half as successive waves of COVID-19 prompted people to postpone non-essential healthcare procedures, such as surgeries or general treatments and tests, as they wanted to avoid hospital visits. 
However, with an increased pace of vaccinations, notably in Europe and the Middle East, demand for hospital procedures has started to return to normal. Europe and the Middle East account for over three quarters of Mediclinic's revenues.
""A key priority for us is to return to pre-pandemic profitability at all three divisions and we remain focused on adapting and delivering efficiencies,"" said Ronnie van der Merwe, Group CEO of Mediclinic, in the statement.

The company reported a 12% jump in revenue to 1.58 billion pounds ($2.14 billion) for the first half when compared with the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue was more than 4% higher than in the first half that ended Sept. 30, 2019, before the pandemic, the hospital operator said.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Rate hikes back on markets' radar,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
Ouch. For all the central bank assurances about the inflation spike being transitory, investors are struggling to look past the biggest annual rise in U.S. inflation in 31 years. 
A stampede for inflation-protected Treasuries (TIPS) sent 10-year yields on such securities to new record lows below -1.2%. 
That's roughly 70 basis points below this year's peak. 
Wednesday's 1% dollar surge and an 11 bps rise in nominal Treasury yields has been followed up today by Japanese data showing wholesale inflation at 40-year high. Wall Street took a beating unsurprisingly; the Nasdaq, laden with tech stocks sensitive to higher longer-term yields, lost 1.7%.
World stocks have stabilised though, after the previous day's 0.7% tumble, supported by news that stricken Chinese developer Evergrande had come good on bond coupons, dodging default for the third time in a month. The bonds in question have risen around half a cent in price.
While money markets are betting central banks will get more aggressive next year -- the first Fed and ECB rate rises are now seen in July and September respectively -- shares have for now at least support from the deeply negative ""real"" interest rates. 
On an inflation-adjusted basis, 10-year U.S. yields plunged to a new record low below -1.2%, keeping alive the there-is-no-alternative (TINA) narrative. 
Cue, Bitcoin hitting new record highs and Amazon-backed EV firm Rivian valued at $100 billion after this year's biggest IPO.
And how worrying really is the inflation picture? 
Forward inflation indicators may offer reassurance. Ten-year breakevens, the level of expected inflation, is 2.7% and 5-year breakevens are 3%. Well above the Fed target, yet nowhere near the current 6.2%.
European shares are opening weaker but companies from a range of sectors -- Burberry, Siemens, Arcelor Mittal, Delivery Hero and Generali (MI:GASI) -- continue to deliver upbeat Q3 earnings. 
Finally, not much cheer for Britain where the economy grew 0.6% in September. It remains smaller than where it was in February 2020. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:

The group said it is targeting operating profit of 1.8 billion euros ($2.08 billion) this year, 100 million more than initially forecast thanks to cost control, and net income of 1.3 billion euros, compared with 1.2 billion euros.
Poste Italiane, which confirmed an interim dividend of 0.185 euros per share, also expects 2021 revenue to increase by 100 million euros from the original target of 11.2 billion euros.
The company, which has insurance, financial and digital payment divisions besides the traditional mail and parcels business, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 18% to 566 million euros in the quarter, slightly below an analyst consensus forecast of 538 million euros.
The core profit rose thanks on the back of the contributions of its parcels and mail division and the payments and mobile business. The insurance division reported a decline, which the company said was expected and in line with its targets.
Poste Italiane revenue rose 7% to 2.76 billion euros in the querter.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 02:36AM ET</span>","Risky business: Climate change turns up the heat on insurers, policyholders","By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - Tony and Jhan Dunn never thought they would leave California, where they grew up, built a life together and planned to retire. 
But after a wildfire swept through their Northern California town of Paradise three years ago, burning their home to the ground, they could not get insurance to buy another.
""We basically got priced out of California,"" Dunn, a retired planning specialist, told Reuters from the couple's new home in North Carolina.
There are thousands of homeowners and businesses from California to Australia in a similar position because the insurance industry, known for its readiness to cover anything from Bruce Springsteen's vocal chords to alien abductions, has trouble factoring in climate change.
The tried and tested approach, where decades' worth of historical data serve to estimate future claims, falls short when weather patterns change and hurricanes, floods, heat waves or snowstorms become more extreme and unpredictable, industry experts say. And the British hosts of the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow acknowledged on Wednesday that current pledges to cut greenhouse gases were not enough to avert climate catastrophe.
Insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) said in a report last week that ""highly anomalous"" floods in Germany and China this year caused record insured losses in those regions.
""Insurers are pulling out because nobody wants to be in the business of losing money,"" says Attila Toth, chief executive at specialist risk analytics firm Zesty.ai. ""And if they don't trust their traditional models, then they are concerned that they will be losing money."" 
Zesty.ai, whose customers include Farmers Insurance, reinsurer Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and Aon, uses artificial intelligence trained on more than 1,400 wildfire events to produce climate change risk scores for any individual property.
In the same vein, reinsurance broker Willis Re is using data from AI firm Cloud to Street to help clients price flood reinsurance.
Insurance statistics show an urgent need for such innovation. 
For example, the average number of large U.S. wildfires has risen by 30% over the past 15 years and by nearly a fifth in just the last five, according to Lloyd's of London insurer Chaucer. 
In all, insured losses for so-called ""secondary"" perils such as floods and wildfires - rather than more closely modelled perils such as hurricanes - nearly doubled over the past decade, data compiled by Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) shows. 
The reinsurer expects no let-up, forecasting a 30-63% rise in insured losses for all types of natural catastrophes in advanced markets by 2040. China, Britain, France and Germany, could even see those soaring between 90% and 120%. 
Given the momentum, it is no surprise that traditional models cannot keep up, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of insurance market Lloyd's of London told Reuters.
""If you’ve reached an exponential part of the curve where suddenly, something’s accelerating, it’s almost certain that we are underpricing the risk that we’re taking."" 
FEELING THE HEAT
Policyholders are already feeling the heat, with coverage getting costlier or harder to come by. 
Broker Marsh estimates U.S. property insurance rates have risen by 10% in the third quarter.
In California, non-renewals of homeowners' insurance policies rose 31% from a year earlier in 2019 to more than 235,000, the state's Insurance Department's most recent data showed. The data for 2020 could be similar, according to Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog LA.
Across the northern border, the Insurance Bureau of Canada warned on its website homeowners might not be able to buy a new insurance policy if they have suffered a fire.
Among those pulling back from home insurance in California are some household names such as Liberty Mutual, Nationwide and State Farm. Liberty Mutual said it was a ""difficult but necessary step to reduce overall exposure to wildfires,"" a sentiment echoed by other insurers.
Some insurers aim to reduce their exposure by helping clients become more resilient. Commercial insurer AXA, for example, offers a consulting service for clients such as manufacturers, identifying their vulnerabilities and suggesting remedies, such as erecting flood barriers, its chief risk officer Renaud Guidee told Reuters.
""This is really an alignment of interest."" 
U.S. insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB) is also working with clients to help them make their infrastructure sturdier, said Paul J Krump, Vice Chairman, Chubb Group, Global Underwriting and Claims.
Reinsurers, with their global scope and long history of underwriting catastrophe risks, also have a role to play in helping the industry adapt to climate change, analysts say.
Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geo scientist at Munich Re, said the group had the expertise and willingness to take on climate risk.
The 141-year-old company set up a team to work on natural catastrophes and climate change in the 1970s after noticing loss patterns starting to change for weather related events, Rauch said.
""We observed a continuation of years with losses significantly higher compared to the last 35 years or so. And that's reflected in our models,"" he said. 
Yet there was a gap between what the reinsurer considered a fair premium and what insurers were prepared to pay.
""We can only transfer this risk on our balance sheet if we get the premium which we need to cover these risks, based on our own assessment,"" Rauch said.
Ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) warned even reinsurers could be underestimating their exposure to climate risk by as much as 50%, describing their efforts to account for climate change as ""nascent"" in a recent report.
Industry experts also say disasters such as hurricanes in Florida with a long history of causing severe damage, are more closely modelled than floods or wildfires, which have only in recent years begun to cause major losses.
That calls for reinsurers and independent risk modelling firms such as RMS and KCC to try new ways of approaching natural catastrophes.
One such approach is scenario modelling, where insurers are provided with a number of possible climate impacts on their portfolios over years, to take account of ""the whole range of uncertainty,"" said Laurent Marescot, senior director, EMEA and CIS, at RMS, which sells its risk models to insurers.
Another involves machine learning, which can be used to take existing models of floods in a particular region, for example, and map them to other parts of the world, Marescot said.

But any developments in making insurance more available and affordable will come too late for the Dunns. 
""It was sad because we both spent our whole lives in California, we both grew up in San Diego,"" Tony Dunn said. ""I never had any intentions ever of leaving California.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court has given a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) shareholder access to confidential documents to check whether the country's No.1 bank complied with its own climate change policy in lending to oil and gas projects.
The Federal court on Thursday published an order granting the Guy & Kim Abrahams Family Trust authorisation to inspect some of the bank's internal documentation on seven oil and gas projects.
It is the first time an Australian court has granted access to internal documentation to scrutinise a company's compliance with its net-zero climate change policy, said the Abrahams' lawyer David Barnden.
It comes amid growing concerns about ""greenwashing"", where companies give a flattering picture of their climate policies and business practices to boost their appeal to ethical investors.
""The orders enable our clients to inspect internal bank documents so they can come to a view on whether the bank was involved in greenwashing or have sufficient internal systems to ensure their policies are complied with,"" Barnden said.
The Abrahams' concerns stem from the bank's financing of the seven projects despite committing in 2019 to only providing funds for new oil and gas or metallurgical coal projects if they were in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
The investor will get CBA records on projects including the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline in the United States, Euronav (NYSE:EURN) NV crude carriers and Santos's acquisition of the Barossa Gas Field.
The Abrahams will get access to ""all documents created by (CBA) in order to carry out an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts of the projects... (and) documents created ... in order to carry out an assessment of whether the projects are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" the document says.
The orders also grant access to board and executive leadership records documenting CBA's change in its oil and gas policies this year, which drop its previously all-encompassing restrictions on lending to the sector unless the projects align with the Paris Agreement.

A Commonwealth Bank spokesperson declined to comment.
CBA Chief Executive Matt Comyn has previously said the bank updated its policies to be more specific about what would and would not finance.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. National Institutes of Health scientists played ""a major role"" in developing  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine and the agency intends to defend its claim as co-owner of patents on the shot, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins told Reuters on Wednesday.
In a story first reported by the New York Times on Tuesday, Moderna excluded three NIH scientists as co-inventors of a central patent for the company's multibillion-dollar COVID-19 vaccine in its application filed in July.
""I think Moderna has made a serious mistake here in not providing the kind of co-inventorship credit to people who played a major role in the development of the vaccine that they're now making a fair amount of money off of,"" Collins said in an interview ahead of the Reuters Total Health conference, which will run virtually from Nov. 15-18. [https://reutersevents.com/events/healthcare/ https://reutersevents.com/events/healthcare/]]
Moderna expects 2021 sales of $15 billion to $18 billion from the COVID-19 vaccine - its first and only commercial product - and up to $22 billion next year.
In a statement emailed to Reuters, Moderna acknowledged that scientists at NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) played a ""substantial role"" in developing Moderna's messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, but the company said it disagrees with the agency's patent claims.
Collins said the NIH has been trying to resolve the patent conflict with Moderna amicably for some time and has failed. 
""But we are not done. Clearly this is something that legal authorities are going to have to figure out,"" he said.
NIH has asserted that three of its scientists - Dr. John Mascola, Dr. Barney Graham (NYSE:GHM) and Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett - helped design the genetic sequence used in Moderna's vaccine and should be named on the patent application. Graham has since retired and Corbett is now working at Harvard.
""It's not a good idea to file a patent when you leave out important inventors, and so this is going to get sorted as people look harder at this,"" Collins told Reuters. 
""I did not expect that to be the outcome from what had been a very friendly, collaborative effort between scientists at NIH and Moderna over many years.""
In its statement, Moderna said, ""We do not agree that NIAID scientists co-invented claims to the mRNA-1273 sequence itself. Only Moderna’s scientists came up with the sequence for the mRNA used in our vaccine.""

Moderna said the company has acknowledged NIH scientists in other patent applications, such as those related to dosing. But for the core patent, Moderna is only required to list Moderna scientists as inventors of the sequence under the strict rules of U.S. patent law, it said.
""We are grateful for our collaboration with NIH scientists, value their contributions, and remain focused on working together to help patients,"" the company added.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open mixed Thursday, as investors digest the sharp rise in U.S. inflation and U.K. growth data on a busy day for European corporate earnings.
At 2:15 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.3% while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
U.S. consumer price index surged 6.2% on an annual basis last month, according to data released on Wednesday, climbing at the fastest pace since 1990, boosting the case for faster Federal Reserve policy tightening.
The major indices on Wall Street closed lower Wednesday as the thought of the U.S. central bank potentially tightening monetary policy weighed, particularly on the high-profile tech sector. 
However, the tone is more circumspect in Europe as the region’s central bank is seen as being way behind the Fed in terms of reining in its accommodative monetary policy stance. Only last week President Christine Lagarde stated that the European Central Bank is very unlikely to raise interest rates next year as inflation remains too low.
Additionally, economic growth suffered a setback in the third quarter in Europe, with U.K. GDP climbing just 1.3% on the quarter, a sharp slowdown from the 5.5% rate in the previous quarter. The annual growth rate slowed to 6.6% from the 23.6% level seen in the second quarter. 
The onslaught of European corporate earnings continued Thursday, with  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) reporting better-than-expected sales and orders during its fourth quarter, the German engineering giant overcoming ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.
RWE (DE:RWEG), Germany's largest power producer, posted a 6% rise in nine-month core profit, and Zurich Insurance (SIX:ZURN) expressed confidence in hitting its 2022 targets while reporting property and casualty premiums rose 11% on a like-for-like basis in the first nine months. U.K. insurance group  Aviva  (LON:AV) also reported solid growth across all its businesses.
Crude prices edged higher Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s losses on concerns the sharp rise in U.S. inflation, boosted by high energy costs, will prompt the Biden administration to release more strategic stockpiles.
Inventories of gasoline and distillates continued to fall, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, while crude stockpiles rose just over 1 million barrels, after the government released 3.1 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
President Joe Biden said he asked the National Economic Council to work to reduce energy costs, which may result in further SPR releases.   
By 2:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 9.1% higher at $81.39 a barrel, having dropped 3.3% on Wednesday, while the Brent contract traded flat at $82.62, after fallen 2.5% in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,855.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1479.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Oil Search shareholders are set to vote on Dec. 7 on a merger with Santos Ltd after gaining approval from a Papua New Guinea court and a mixed endorsement from an independent expert.
If it goes ahead, the A$8.8 billion ($6.5 billion) takeover of Oil Search (OTC:OISHY) would create a global top 20 oil and gas company and make Santos the largest shareholder in Papua New Guinea's biggest resource project, the PNG LNG project, run by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
Oil Search's appointed independent expert firm, Grant Samuel, said the merger was in the best interest of Oil Search shareholders as it would boost funding for its $3 billion Pikka oil project in Alaska and improve gas development prospects in Papua New Guinea.
It said Santos' offer, which will give Oil Search shareholders a 38.5% stake in the merged group, did not fully reflect Oil Search's underlying value, which it said was worth 43%-44% of the total estimated value of the merged group.
""There is clearly a risk that the funding and other strategic benefits do not fully compensate shareholders for this dilution,"" Grant Samuel said in a report attached to the merger document going to shareholders.
It concluded nevertheless that Oil Search shareholders were likely to be better off if the deal went ahead, given growing funding constraints facing the industry in the drive away from fossil fuels.
Oil Search acting chief executive Peter Fredericson defended the merger ratio, saying it took into account relative contributions from earnings, reserves and production along with the strategic benefits, such as much better access to capital markets for the enlarged group.
""At the end of the day there are going to be one or two out there who are going to say it's not enough in the deal that we've got, but the majority of shareholders we've spoken to see the strategic benefit of putting these two businesses together,"" Fredericson told Reuters.

Based on Santos' closing share price of A$6.78 on Thursday, its offer valued Oil Search at A$4.25 a share, slightly above Oil Search's close, indicating investors expect the deal to go ahead.

The two owners said they had sought to realise some of those gains and diversify their holdings while still remaining committed to Aker BP.
""Consistent with our long-standing track-record of active portfolio management, these divestment proceeds will be expected to further strengthen (BP's) balance sheet and support our ongoing buyback commitment,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said in a statement.
As part of the transaction, Aker and BP agreed to not sell any further shares in the venture for the next six months.
""Aker BP is, and will remain, a core holding in Aker's portfolio,"" Aker Chief Executive Oeyvind Eriksen said.
""The aim of the offering is however to balance Aker's portfolio by freeing up liquidity, diversifying and continue growing the portfolio,"" he said.
Aker sold 10.29 million shares, leaving it with a 37.14% stake, while BP sold 7.72 million shares and now owns 27.85% of Aker BP.

Managers of the share sale were J.P. Morgan, Pareto Securities, DNB Markets, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

The Xi'an-headquartered Longji Green Technology Co has two offshore plants in Malaysia and Vietnam, accounting for about 1% of its total wafer capacity and 20% of its cell and module products capacity.
""Recently we are actively studying to build manufacturing plants in other regions with advantageous production factors, such as India, Saudi Arabia and the U.S.,"" Li Zhenguo, President of Longi Green Tech, told an online media roundtable on Thursday.
Longi has 85 GW of monocrystaline silicon wafer production capacity and 50 GW of solar module production capacity. 
The firm will strive to maintain its global market share in monocrystalline silicon wafer at 45% and to bring the share in solar module to more than 30%, Li said, without disclosing a timeframe. Longi supplied about 19% of solar modules worldwide in 2020.
The U.S. market was about 15% of Longi's total solar products sales in the first half of 2021, compared with 11% in 2020, despite the persistent trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.
""Chinese solar products are imposed by about 150% import tariffs by the U.S. It's almost impossible for China-made products to be sold there,"" said Li, adding that Longi's Malaysia and Vietnam factories are mainly targeting the U.S. market.
The U.S. government in June also banned imports from five Chinese solar firms accused of using forced labour in Xinjiang.
Li said moving solar manufacturing capacity overseas is a ""right thing"" in light of China's climate change pledges.

""Carbon neutrality is not only a Chinese business, but a global issue... It is unfair to leave all energy consumption pressures on China while shipping Chinese solar products worldwide,"" Li said.
China, who has vowed to bring its carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060, accounts for nearly 80% of solar wafer and module capacity in the world.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) expects Beijing to allow 'metaverse' virtual environment services, now the talk of Silicon Valley, to operate in China - provided they fall in line with Chinese rules. 
In some of its first public comments on the metaverse, Tencent, China's biggest company by market value, welcomed the potential for gaming business opportunities in a post-earnings call on Wednesday, but acknowledged China's version of the metaverse would need to be different to the rest of the world's.
""There's a lot of technologies that's related to the development of games as well as for the metaverse,"" Tencent president Martin Lau told analysts on a call peppered with questions about the metaverse.
Investors have pored over the prospects for the burgeoning virtual reality world ever since Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which recently changed its name to Meta Platforms Inc, announced that he would devote the future of his company on building a metaverse.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Disney have also said they are also working on their own metaverses.
""The Chinese government will be in support of the development of such technologies as long as the user experience is actually provided under the regulatory framework,"" said Tencent's Lau.
Amid the metaverse fervour, questions have been raised among tech investors about how it might evolve in China, where the internet is tightly censored and authorities have waged a wide-raging crackdown against its once free-wheeling giants, including Tencent since last year.
Regulators have banned all crypto transactions, tightened oversight of the gaming industry and also warned against ""blind"" investment in metaverse-linked stocks.
Lau said although there would be likely different sets of rules concerning the metaverse for China and the world, this was ""not fundamentally averse to the development of metaverse"".
Tencent, the world's largest online gaming firm by revenue, is by far leading the charge in China on the concept of virtual worlds, which has also attracted the interest of rivals such as NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and TikTok owner ByteDance, according to data firm NewZoo.
Lau said there were ""multiple pathways"" to the metaverse opportunity, such as through interactive games or a social network serving as a 'gamefield'.
""We have a lot of tech and capability building blocks that will allow us to approach the metaverse opportunity,"" he said.

Tencent owns a 40% stake in Epic Games and has a joint venture with Roblox Corp, both of which are working on their own metaverses.
The company, whose businesses also include China's dominant social networking and messaging app WeChat, has also registered over 20 metaverse-related trademarks for its apps in China and is working on more immersive, multi-player games.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc over allegations of overcharging disabled passengers, and asked a federal court to order compliance with an anti-discrimination law.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, targets an April 2016 Uber policy of charging passengers ""wait time"" fees, a practice the ride-sharing service started in several cities and eventually expanded nationwide.
It alleges that the policy violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, saying blind people or users of wheelchairs or walkers need more than two minutes to get into an Uber car.
""People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in a statement.
The department is asking the court to order Uber to modify its wait time fee policy and pay monetary damages for any illegal fees charged.
In a statement, Uber called the lawsuit ""surprising and disappointing,"" citing active discussions with the department on how to address its concerns about the policy.
""Wait time fees are charged to all riders to compensate drivers after two minutes of waiting, but were never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location, but need more time to get into the car,"" the company said.

Uber said its policy has been to refund wait time fees for disabled riders ""whenever they alerted us that they were charged.""
Last week, it said it updated the policy so that ""any rider who certifies they are disabled will have fees automatically waived.""

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) stocks got a boost after it cleared more overdue payments. Investors breathed a sigh of relief as the embattled developer once again averted a default.
China Evergrande’s Hong Kong shares jumped 5.91% to HK$2.51 ($0.32) by 11:31 PM ET (4:31 AM GMT) after the developer paid the overdue interest on three dollar bonds. They climbed up to $2.56 earlier in the session.
The bonds are a 9.5% security due 2022, 10% note due 2023, and a 10.5% bond due 2024.
Customers from Clearstream, an international clearing firm, received the interest payments, the company said. Two investors, who hold two of the notes, confirmed that they have received the payments, according to media reports.
Investors had been holding their breath to see if China Evergrande would be able to make the payments, totaling $148.1 million, before the end of a 30-day grace period on Wednesday. The developer missed the initial deadline, which was in October.
The developer’s dollar notes have climbed up from record lows in recent weeks as distressed debt buyers have expressed interest. However, the levels still indicate that an eventual restructuring is highly likely.
However, debt woes are far from over for China Evergrande, the world’s most indebted developer. It still has more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.
As concerns remain that the debt could affect other capital markets, Chinese authorities are pressuring China Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan to help repay the debt with his personal funds.
The company has so far not defaulted on any publicly traded dollar bonds."

The company has cut down the number of PS5 units assembled for the fiscal year to about 15 million, from its previous target of 16 million units, the report added, citing people familiar with its operations. 
The development comes amid a global shortage of semiconductors which is impacting companies including Sony. Sony did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
In October, the conglomerate - spanning areas such as entertainment, sensors and financial services - said it was on track to sell 14.8 million PS5 consoles this financial year, a target that takes into account the global shortages. 
Gaming firms' earnings were hit last year by stay-at-home demand during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, sliding PlayStation user numbers have stabilised, Sony's finance chief Hiroki Totoki said, as the company approaches the year-end shopping season. 

Separately, Sony is partnering with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to build a $7 billion chip plant in Japan. 
Construction of the factory, which local media said last month would supply semiconductors to Sony's image sensor business, will begin in 2022, with production slated to begin at the end of 2024, the companies said in a press release.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 10:41PM ET</span>","Chevron, partners to fork out for carbon offsets for Gorgon LNG carbon capture shortfall","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and its partners in the Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Western Australia have agreed to buy carbon credits likely to cost more than $180 million as a penalty for failing to meet a five-year target for carbon capture and storage (CCS).
The costs, which could amount to well over A$250 million ($184 million) based on Reuters calculations, will be shared with its Gorgon LNG partners -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), and Japan's Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA.
The A$3.1 billion Gorgon CCS project, the world's largest commercial CCS project, is being penalised by the Western Australian government for injecting far less carbon dioxide than planned since the LNG plant started up five years ago.
Chevron said in a statement that it would invest A$40 million in ""lower carbon projects"" and would buy and surrender 5.23 million greenhouse gas offsets to fulfill the Gorgon project's obligations to the state government, ideally by mid-July 2022.
""The package we have announced ... ensures we meet the expectations of the regulator, the community and those we place on ourselves as a leading energy producer in Australia,"" Chevron Australia Managing Director Mark Hatfield said in a statement.
Based on the current price of carbon offsets on the voluntary Australian spot market, which last week hit a record high of A$37 a tonne, 5.23 million offsets would cost at least A$195 million.
Amid short supply of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), Chevron is unlikely to meet its obligation just with those offsets and said in a report to the government it would also use other internationally verified carbon units and offsets.
Gorgon CCS was designed to inject up to 4 million tonnes a year of CO2. Since starting injecting CO2 in August 2019, three years later than scheduled, it has injected a total of about 5.5 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent.

The project was delayed by three years due to a range of technical problems.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>","In China, global automakers seek clarity from a more ambitious regulator","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - For foreign automakers, selling in China - the world's biggest car market and front-runner by far in the adoption of electric vehicles - can yield great rewards. But the regulatory headaches can also be really painful.
A lack of transparency, insufficient lead time for new rules as well as unequal ""access to policy and standards drafting processes"" were key complaints about Chinese auto regulation listed in a European Union Chamber of Commerce report.
Though the survey-based report published in September did not cite specific examples, auto industry sources say it highlights bubbling frustration with China's regulatory process as well as growing pains as automakers adapt to the country's expanding regulatory clout - particularly in EVs.
In the past, cars that met EU and U.S. auto standards did not have too much difficulty satisfying Chinese regulatory bodies which had based their own regulations on Western equivalents. 
But China is now coming to the forefront of EV regulation. That's a natural consequence of its sheer market size - it accounted for roughly 40% of all electric vehicles sold worldwide in 2020 - as well as part of broad conscious efforts by Chinese authorities to start taking the lead in international standards across a range of industries.
VW'S SCRAMBLE
An expensive scramble by Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) engineers last year to redesign a battery pack for its ID.4 electric SUV illustrates the tensions at play in China's auto sector. 
The battery pack had passed Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and German government tests for managing heat but it did not meet planned Chinese requirements aimed at making EVs highly unlikely to catch fire in the first five minutes after a crash, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
No information from the Chinese government about when the new standards would be effective contributed to the problem, the sources said. But they added stubbornness from Volkswagen headquarters was also responsible as Wolfsburg failed to realise Chinese regulators were not amenable to hearing out the German automaker's point of view as they had been in the past.
In addition to sending managers to China's industry ministry and auto testing agency China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) to press for clarification on when the rule might be made effective, Volkswagen assembled a team of engineers who spent around six months working out fixes, said the sources.
In the end, the orginally planned lightweight aluminum battery pack was replaced by a heavier aluminum-steel pack with a different structural design. The mechanical design for the car's chassis was also changed.
""Sometimes changing key components in an existing model is harder than making a new one and ID.4 is a good example of that,"" said one source.
The sources declined to be identified discussing internal matters. Volkswagen said in a statement to Reuters that the ID.4 gained regulatory approval smoothly, that its regional teams get the necessary support to meet local legal requirements and it has zero tolerance for non-compliance.
SEEKING MORE TIME, CLARITY
Chinese authorities could do more to make the regulatory process clearer and less liable to throwing up unwelcome surprises, executives at foreign automakers say.
Hans Georg Engel, head of research and development at Mercedes-Benz in China, told reporters last month one challenge for vehicle development and testing in China is that there is not enough time to comply after a new regulation goes into effect. 
Other complaints include that sometimes only Chinese automakers are invited to initial meetings on proposed new regulations while foreign automakers only get to attend later, according to senior officials at overseas carmakers. They were not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
China's industry ministry and CATARC did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
GOING GLOBAL
Last year, Beijing outlined ""China Standards 2035"" - a new industrial strategy it had spent two years developing and one that seeks to make China a major voice, if not take the driver's seat, when international standards are set.
Its plans for promoting better standards encompass a wide range of industries - from tech to steel to packaging to biotech - as well as autos.
To that end, state-owned CATARC, which is backed by China's industry ministry, is increasing its international reach. 
In June, CATARC set up an office in Geneva, home to United Nations transportation regulators. It has also been working with Indonesia's government on EV policies and holding routine talks with countries like Uzbekistan and Belarus. In September, it said in a post that some of China's auto regulations have been adopted by markets like the European Union, Israel and Chile.
Increasing the global impact of China's auto emission rules will also help with the exports of China-made engines, components and testing machines, Wu Xianfeng, an official at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told CATARC's annual meeting in September.
To lessen the chance of regulatory surprises, foreign automakers are investing more in China research and development centres as this will give them a closer ear to the ground and more expertise on technical requirements that matter most to Chinese regulators.
Volkswagen is building a new research centre in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei where it is boosting EV production, and just last month Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc announced it had built a new R&D centre in Shanghai - its first outside the United States, while  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) opened a new research centre in Beijing.

""This world is changing so fast as we go into software-driven and electric vehicles that all governments around the world are running very fast to regulate,"" Hubertus Troska, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s China chief said at the opening.
""Given the importance of China...this is the intention of our company to make sure Chinese requirements will be never forgotten.""

Meanwhile, Tuesday's data showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 8.6% year-on-year. The core PPI grew 0.4% month-on-month.

(Reuters) - Mickey Mouse is poised to venture into the metaverse.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Chapek said the entertainment conglomerate is preparing to make the technological leap into a virtual reality world first imagined by science fiction writers.
It is a popular destination these days, ever since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the future of his company would be devoted to creating a robust, three-dimensional environment where users’ digital avatars would work, hang out and pursue their hobbies.
Other big companies, including game-makers Roblox Corp and Epic Games, and software giant  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), are working on their own metaverses. Disney’s plan was notably devoid of specifics, beyond dropping a buzzword that has animated Silicon Valley.
Chapek told investors Wednesday that entering this new digital frontier is consistent with Disney’s long history of technological innovation, dating back nearly a century to Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound. 
“Our efforts to date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling, without boundaries in our own Disney Metaverse,” Chapek said during Disney’s fourth-quarter earnings call.
In an interview with CNBC, Chapek said he envisions it as an extension of streaming video service Disney+ -- through the “three-dimensional canvass” he envisions for new types of storytelling.

Disney’s former executive vice president of digital, Tilak Mandadi, wrote on LinkedIn in 2020 about creating a theme park metaverse, where “physical and digital world converge” through wearable devices, smartphones and digital access points. 
Not all of Disney’s digital forays have had happy endings. Its online children’s social network, Club Penguin, shuttered in 2017, after 11 years. Its entry into social gaming, via its $563.2 million purchase of Playdom in 2010, resulted in a write-down. Its efforts to capitalize on the galloping popularity of short-form YouTube videos through a $500 million acquisition of Maker Studios in 2014, resulted in the operation being absorbed into other parts of the company.

(Reuters) -Shares of Rivian Automotive Inc surged as much as 53% in its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, giving the Amazon-backed electric vehicle maker a market valuation of more than $100 billion after the world's biggest initial public offering this year.
Rivian shares closed at $100.73, marking a nearly 30% jump from its offering price. 
That made Rivian the second most valuable U.S. automaker after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which is worth $1.06 trillion. Despite just having started selling vehicles and having little revenue to report, Rivian ranked ahead of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) at $86.05 billion, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co at $77.37 billion, and Lucid Group at $65.96 billion.
Rivian also has trouble ramping up production in Illinois as supply-chain constraints have hit automakers globally. Last July, the EV maker said COVID-19 and its impact on suppliers had delayed the launch of vehicles out of Illinois.
Since last year, EV companies have emerged as some of the hottest investments. Including securities such as options and restricted stock units, Rivian's fully diluted valuation exceeded $106 billion at its debut price.
The IPO allowed Rivian to raise about $12 billion to fund growth, and that figure could rise to $13.7 billion if the full over-allotment of shares is exercised. This makes it the biggest U.S. IPO since  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd went public in September 2014.
""The transition to a public company (and) the growth in our capital base"" enables Rivian to develop ""promising products and volume and growth in terms of new segments and new vehicles that we'll be going into,"" Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in an interview.
Wall Street's biggest institutional investors, including T. Rowe Price and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), are betting on Rivian to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla Inc amid mounting pressure on automakers in China and Europe to eliminate vehicle emissions.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is Rivian's largest shareholder with a 20% stake.
Rivian's IPO comes against the backdrop of the United Nations Climate Summit, where automakers, airlines and governments unveiled a raft of pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions from global transport. 
GM CEO Mary Barra on Wednesday said Rivian's IPO only showed how undervalued her company is.
""What it highlights to me is the huge opportunity,"" she said at a New York Times event. ""General Motors is so undervalued.""
EXPANSION PLANS
Rivian has been investing heavily to boost production, doubling down on its upscale all-electric R1T pickup truck launched in September. It plans to follow that with an SUV and delivery van, hitting some of the hottest segments in the market.
The Irvine, California-based company plans to build at least one million vehicles a year by the end of the decade, Scaringe said. It has a plant in Illinois, and has announced plans to open a second U.S. factory and eventually setting up production in China and Europe.
""Rivian is in the early stages of delivering its first vehicles to customers, which tells investors the company and vehicles are 'real' and not merely pictures in a slide deck,"" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Michael Shlisky said. ""This has been an issue with other EV companies in recent months."" 
On Wednesday, 10 environmental and advocacy groups, including Sierra Club and Greenpeace, urged Rivian to engage with labor unions as the company grows. Workers at Rivian's plant in Illinois are not unionized.
Founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors by Scaringe, the company was renamed in 2011 as Rivian, a name derived from ""Indian River"" in Florida, a place Scaringe frequented in a rowboat as a youth.
Scaringe will hold all outstanding Class B common shares after the IPO and get 10 votes per share, Rivian said in a filing. 
Rivian, also backed by Ford, priced an upsized IPO of 153 million shares at $78 per share, raising nearly $12 billion, making it one of the biggest U.S. IPOs of all time. Ford declined to reveal plans for its Rivian stake of about 12%, which was worth about $10 billion on Wednesday.
Amazon, T. Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are among a group of ""cornerstone investors"" which are indicated to buy up to $5 billion worth of shares, according to the filing.

Rivian's shares were also offered to retail investors on Social Finance Inc (SoFi).
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for the offering.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co that some of its appointees overseeing aircraft certification tasks lack expertise and directed the largest U.S. planemaker to quickly address the issue.
In a Nov. 2 letter seen by Reuters, the FAA told Boeing an oversight review conducted this summer found some appointees did not have required expertise and found some of those Boeing employees performing certification tasks for the agency ""are not meeting FAA expectations.""
The air regulator added that of 12 recent appointees who handle safety matters on the agency’s behalf, some ""38% struggled to demonstrate an understanding of FAA certification processes.""
An FAA spokesman said the letter speaks for itself.
Under a new law adopted in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes in five months that killed 346 people, the FAA will start exercising new oversight over the selection of candidates who perform safety work on the FAA's behalf.
Starting Jan. 1, Boeing will nominate candidates for but the FAA must approve or reject them. The FAA will also review existing members.
Boeing said Wednesday it is ""committed to ensuring the highest levels of safety and quality in all that we do, and that includes the important work of Boeing employees who are designated as authorized representatives. We respect the FAA’s oversight role and look forward to strengthening"" the selection process and overall program.
The letter also cited concerns about appointment evaluation panels have ""not demonstrated an independent assessment of a candidate’s experience and technical capability."" The FAA directed Boeing to investigate and submit ""corrective action"" within 30 days.
The day after the letter was sent, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Congress https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-administrator-says-boeing-has-more-work-do-2021-11-03 that Boeing has ""more work to do.""

""Boeing is not the same as it was two years ago but they have more to work to do,"" Dickson said. ""We have reset the relationship with Boeing in no uncertain terms.""
Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department into the MAX as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.

862,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:11PM ET</span>",Beijing Stock Exchange clears companies to list on Nov 15 -filings,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's new Beijing Stock Exchange has approved applications from 10 companies to list shares on Nov. 15, company filings showed late on Wednesday, two months after Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the bourse for small and medium-sized firms.
The companies, currently listed on the so-called ""innovation tier"" of Beijing's over-the-counter National Equities Exchange and Quotations, known as the 'New Third Board', said in separate statements their shares will be listed on the Beijing Stock Exchange next Monday.
The companies include Beijing Henghe Information Technology Co, Keda Automation Control and Anhui Jingsai Technology Co.     
China's securities regulator has said the new exchange will complement existing bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Investors are expecting a busy start to trade in light of frothy launches of other boards, such as Shanghai's STAR Market https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-star-idUSKCN1UH03G in 2019. 
    A set of rules for the Beijing Stock Exchange was published last month. Individual investors qualified to trade must have at least 500,000 yuan ($77,459) of assets in their stock accounts.
""It underscores the speed and efficiency in launching the Beijing Stock Exchange,"" said Zhou Yunnan, a veteran investor in the New Third Board, on which the new bourse is based.
    ""It's imperative to launch the bourse, which is tasked with deepening China's capital market reforms,"" he added.
    China has stepped up support for small and medium-sized enterprises struggling in a slowing economy, while cracking down on tech giants under President Xi's objective of ""common prosperity"", a policy drive to narrow the gap between rich and poor.

    The Beijing bourse will employ a registration-based initial public offering (IPO) mechanism, which paves the way for the rollout of the listing system on China's main boards,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
    Currently, only Shenzhen's ChiNext, and Shanghai's tech-focused STAR Market have adopted a U.S.-style IPO system.

Foxconn acquired the shares at $6.8983 apiece, Lordstown said. The stock, which had closed at $5.56 in regular trading, rose about 10% to $6.11 after the bell.
In September, Foxconn said it would buy an Ohio plant assembly plant owned by Lordstown for $230 million and take over production of the U.S. company's Endurance full-size pickup truck.
Foxconn - the world's largest contract electronics maker best known for assembling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone - agreed to make a down payment of $100 million by Nov. 18.
""The partnership with Foxconn should enable Lordstown Motors to significantly reduce its raw material, component and other input costs,"" the company said.
The deal is expected to close by April 30, Lordstown said.

Earlier in the day, Lordstown said long-time automotive industry executive Edward Hightower would take over as president.
Lordstown's shares have lost more than 70% of their value this year. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is getting traction with China in talks over Beijing's compliance with a Trump-era trade deal, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Wednesday, but she declined to predict an outcome while discussions continue.
Tai told reporters in Washington the administration aims to hold China accountable to the two-year ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed in January 2020 and is exploring all weaknesses in China's performance, including its lack of purchases of commercial aircraft.
She said the talks with Beijing on the Phase 1 deal are being twinned with discussions on larger issues, including China's ""extremely robust"" state-driven industrial policies that are making it difficult for U.S. companies to compete. 
""I think that we consider this Phase 1 engagement to be the first step,"" Tai said. ""And it's not in my interest for this first step to take a very, very long time.""
China is running far behind in its promises in the deal to boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion during 2020 and 2021, compared to 2017 levels, reaching only 60% of the target through Sept. 30 https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods, according to data compiled by trade economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The deal also includes promised steps by China to improve protections for U.S. intellectual property, and increase market access for U.S. agriculture biotechnology products and financial services.
Asked if she was pushing in the talks for China to take steps to allow for purchases of Boeing (NYSE:BA) commercial aircraft - a purchase category identified in the Phase 1 agreement https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf - Tai said: ""If you're looking at where the weaknesses might be, in terms of Phase 1, you should expect that we are talking through it and exploring all of it.""
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a virtual meeting scheduled as early as next week amid rising tension between the world's two largest economies.
Tai said the meeting would be helpful and their understanding of each other would benefit a complex relationship. But she said the leaders' engagement was not necessary to facilitate the trade discussions.

""I don't want any of you in this room thinking that we are not getting traction with our Chinese counterparts,"" Tai said. ""We're talking and we're working. So we don't need, you know, Dads to come in,"" she added, referring to Biden and Xi.
Asked if the administration was considering easing tariffs on Chinese goods as a way to reduce inflationary pressures on the U.S. economy, Tai said USTR was viewing the ""Section 301"" tariffs on Chinese goods as part of a strategy to seek an advantageous position to more effectively compete with China.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate panel to hold Nov 17 hearing on Biden FCC pick,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said on Wednesday it will hold a Nov. 17 confirmation hearing for a new term for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, but will not immediately move forward with a hearing for another nominee for the telecommunications regulator.
Late last month, Biden nominated Rosenworcel for a new term on the five-member commission and designated her chair. Biden also nominated Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler, who served as an FCC chairman under President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The Commerce Committee will not immediately hold a hearing on Sohn's nomination.
The committee will also consider the nomination of Alvaro Bedoya to serve on the Federal Trade Commission at the Nov. 17 hearing.
Biden waited more than nine months to make nominations for the FCC, which has not been able to address some key issues because it currently has one vacancy and is divided 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans.
The Commerce Committee also will not immediately hold a hearing on the recent nomination of Alan Davidson, a senior adviser at Mozilla, to head the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the executive branch agency principally responsible for advising the White House on telecommunications and information policy issues. NTIA will oversee more than $42 billion in funding approved this month by Congress to expand internet access.
Without being confirmed to a new term, Rosenworcel would need to leave the FCC at the end of the year.

One key issue is whether the FCC under Democrats will reinstate landmark net neutrality rules that were repealed under Trump.
The FCC under President Barack Obama, Trump's predecessor, adopted the net neutrality rules in 2015 barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>",Disney+ sees smallest subscriber growth since launch in battle with Netflix,"By Lisa Richwine and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Walt Disney Co on Wednesday reported the smallest rise in Disney+ subscriptions since it launched the streaming video service to take on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), missing Wall Street targets and driving shares down nearly 5% after hours.
Profits from Disney's theme park division fell well short of analyst projections, despite the quarter being the first time all parks were open since various pandemic closures. Capacity limits remain in place.
The stumble in both the theme parks and streaming divisions https://tmsnrt.rs/3n60OoZ highlights the challenges Disney faces in the pandemic. Questions remain about how and when customers will return to public entertainment and whether that limits watching at home.
Disney is banking on new programming next year to boost streaming subscribers. Theme parks will benefit from the United States opening its borders to many vaccinated international travelers and more U.S. children getting the COVID-19 vaccine. 
During the just-ended quarter, Disney+ picked up 2.1 million customers, less than half the subscribers Netflix added in roughly the same period. Analysts had projected Disney+ would add 10.2 million, according to Factset estimates. 
Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Bob Chapek stuck by the company's previous forecast of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. 
Some investors are not convinced Disney will meet that projection, said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.
""The company seems to be hitting a roadblock when it comes to subscriber growth for its streaming service,"" Anwar said. ""Investors feel the company could miss its target of reaching 260 million subscribers by 2024, creating doubts that its service can create a serious challenge for the market leader, Netflix."" 
As of early October, paying subscribers to Disney+ reached 118.1 million. Including Hulu and ESPN+, the company's streaming customers totaled 179 million.
The company previewed a wide-ranging slate of streaming programming in development. Chapek said most of the marquee titles from the Disney, Marvel and Star Wars brands would arrive on Disney+ from July to September next year.
""This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December,"" he said. 
Disney also sees an opportunity to bring in more subscribers with new programming for preschoolers and is investing in that area, Chapek said. 
Disney's streaming media division, known as direct to consumer, continued to lose money as the company paid for new TV shows and movies, marketing and other costs. The unit reported an operating loss of $630 million in the quarter.
Attendance and spending rose at Disney's U.S. parks. Disney does not expect a ""substantial recovery"" in international visitors to U.S. parks until the end of 2022, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.
Overall, the media company posted diluted earnings per share of 37 cents, below analyst projections of 51 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Theme park division income reached $640 million, short of Wall Street projections of $942 million.
This week, Disney is offering the first month of Disney+ for $2, down from the usual $8, and other promotions.
On Friday, Disney will debut adventure movie ""Jungle Cruise,"" Marvel film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" a new ""Home Alone"" movie and a batch of other programming on streaming.

Disney also missed analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue, which rose to $18.53 billion in the fourth quarter from $14.71 billion a year earlier. 
Net income was $159 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $710 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 06:47PM ET</span>","Beyond Meat signals more pain ahead as demand slows, shares tumble 19%","By Uday Sampath Kumar and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) -Beyond Meat Inc forecast fourth-quarter revenue below estimates on Wednesday, as the once red-hot plant-based meat maker reported slowing demand in both grocery stores and restaurants, driving its shares down 19% in extended trading.
The company, which generates the bulk of its revenue from retailers, had cut its third-quarter revenue forecast last month as it took a hit from fewer people stockpiling plant-based burgers and sausages at home after they returned to dining out.
However, Beyond did not sell as many products at restaurants during the quarter either.
Sales of its faux meat fell at fast-food locations when the Delta COVID-19 variant hit and labor shortages caused restaurants to cut hours and trim menus, Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said in an earnings call.
Sales to U.S. retail stores fell 15.6% to $52.4 million in the third quarter, Beyond said, while those to U.S. restaurants fell 7.3% to $15.1 million.
In October, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said it will test a plant-based patty made by Beyond in its McPlant burger at eight U.S. locations. Beyond is also working on products for other global chains including Pizza Hut and KFC, both owned by YUM Brands Inc.
Widespread supply chain problems and labor shortages at Beyond's own facilities and a transportation provider also hampered operations, as did water damage related to severe weather that destroyed ""sizeable amounts"" of packaging at a Pennsylvania storage center.
Brown said the company is focused on long-term growth, including through restaurant partnerships and continued international expansion.
""The only reason we gave more tepid guidance on fourth quarter is just because we didn't want to go through this again,"" Brown said.
""My view...is to get through the year with these unusual conditions and get back to a strong resumption of growth, which I feel very confident about for 2022,"" he said.
The company said it expects fourth-quarter net revenue of $85 million to $110 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $131.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""This is going to be one of those quarters Beyond will want to erase from its memory. Unfortunately, it seems like many of these issues will persist through at least 4Q,"" wrote CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram.

Net revenue rose 12.7% to $106.4 million in the three months ended Oct. 2, but missed estimates of $109.2 million.
Excluding certain items, the company reported a loss of 87 cents per share, compared with analysts' estimates of a loss of 39 cents per share.

In the third quarter, total paying users fell 2% from the prior quarter to 2.9 million as the global Delta variant surge prompted renewed lockdowns, curtailing consumer spending on dating app subscriptions and in-app purchases.
Bumble's other dating app, Badoo, which is mostly used by the urban middle class segment, also saw user growth affected by the economic pressures brought on by the health crisis in some markets.
""Badoo operates in a large number of markets where the pandemic is still a significant challenge ... with differences in pace of recovery by region,"" Chief Executive Officer Whitney Herd said in a post-earnings call. 
""While many key markets such as Russia and Brazil have shown strong growth in both paying users and user revenue, other markets like France and Italy have lagged."" 
Bumble's shares have lost about 32% since its market debut in February.
Despite the slowdown, Texas-based Bumble raised its full-year revenue forecast and said it remained well-positioned for the upcoming quarter as it continues to expand internationally. Rival Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), however, projected fourth-quarter revenue below estimates as COVID-19 hit the Tinder owner's business in Asia.

Bumble expects current-quarter revenue between $208 million and $211 million, above analysts' estimates of $206.0 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Total revenue was $200.5 million in the third quarter, compared with estimates of $198.8 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday as surging consumer prices curbed investor risk appetite, and stoked worries of a protracted wave of red hot inflation.
All three major U.S. stock indexes fell, extending their losses throughout the trading day and adding to Tuesday's sell-off which snapped the S&P 500's and Nasdaq's eight-session runs of all-time closing highs.
""It's not surprising that after what was truly a historic run for the market to take a pause,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""But we do think there are enough tailwinds heading into year-end to move the market higher."" 
The Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI), delivered a hotter-than-expected jump of 0.9% and the fastest year-on-year gain in 31 years.
The report hinted that the persistently tangled global supply chain could result in the current inflation wave taking longer to abate than many - including the U.S. Federal Reserve - had hoped.
""The inflation story is really the driver that drives all things,"" Mayfield added. ""It will affect Fed policy and fiscal policy, it's the driver of interest rates. It's hard to talk about anything but inflation.""
And Gregory Daco, chief economist of Oxford Economics, believes this report means current price spikes have some staying power.
""I think things will continue to get worse before they get better in terms of the inflation outlook because we don't see core inflation peaking until sometime in early 2022,"" Daco said.
The graphic shows core CPI along with other indicators and where they stand relative to the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.

Third-quarter earnings season has reached the final stretch, and of the companies having reported, 81% have beaten street expectations.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co shares dropped more than 4% in after-hours trading after the media company reported disappointing streaming subscriber numbers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rose 4.3%, reversing several sessions of declines in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's polling Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users on whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the company he founded.
This comes as rival electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc made its splash as a publicly traded company, raising $12 billion. Its shares surged 29.1%.

Shares in Affirm, which had been falling for the past four sessions and were on course for their worst day since the company went public in January, jumped more than 27% in extended trading. 
Affirm's expanded partnership will allow all eligible U.S. purchases of $50 and more on Amazon to be split into simple monthly payments, which was earlier available to only select customers.
Amazon will also receive multiple tranches of warrants to purchase shares of Affirm's Class A common stock, the company said, adding that it would be the e-commerce giant's only third-party, non-credit card, BNPL service provider in the United States through January 2023 as part of the amended agreement. 
Additionally, Affirm will also be embedded as a payment method in Amazon Pay's digital wallet in the country.
The BNPL industry took off last year, as homebound consumers opted for online shopping and used pay later options to make purchases easier on their wallets.
BNPL firms charge merchants a fee for offering their customers small, point-of-sale loans which are paid back in interest-free installments, bypassing credit checks in the process. 
The company now expects current-quarter revenue in the range of $320 million to $330 million, above estimates of $296.09 million. 
Total revenue rose to $269.4 million in the first quarter from $173.9 million a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $248.23 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cash-strapped China Evergrande Group, facing a deadline for coupon payments on Wednesday, may have made those payments, according to a report by Bloomberg, which said that customers of international clearing firm Clearstream have received overdue payments on three U.S. dollar bonds. 
Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer which once epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building, has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.
The company has not defaulted on any of its offshore debt obligations. But a 30-day grace period on coupon payments of more than $148 million on its April 2022, 2023 and 2024 bonds ends on Wednesday. 
A failure to pay would result in a formal default by the company and trigger cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar bonds, exacerbating a debt crisis looming over the world's second-largest economy.
Bloomberg reported https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/evergrande-said-to-pay-delayed-interest-on-at-least-two-bonds?srnd=premium&sref=9L3Xztl1 that customers of Clearstream received overdue payments on three U.S. dollar bonds, quoting a spokesperson for Clearstream and citing bondholders of two of the bonds saying they received payments. Clearstream did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Exactly what time the grace period expires on Wednesday is unclear, but the two sources with knowledge of the matter earlier told Reuters that some bondholders had not been paid by the end of the Asian business day. They declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Evergrande declined to comment. 
For its two separate offshore coupon payment obligations that were due in late September, the developer's bondholders did not receive the payments until one working day after the 30-day grace periods ended.
""The expectation is that it will be paid,"" said Karl Clowry, restructuring adviser and partner at Addleshaw Goddard LLP, also pointing to a potential easing in the weeks ahead of the so-called three red lines https://www.reuters.com/article/china-property-debt-rules/update-1-chinese-state-firms-ask-regulators-to-adjust-loan-curbs-for-property-deals-cailianshe-idINL1N2S10OY - financial requirements introduced by the central bank last year that developers must meet to get new bank loans.
""It would be quite a surprise if the funds do not flow to the trustee in the requisite timeframe given the immediate cross-default and ripple effect on suppliers and the wider People's Republic of China real estate market."" 
Evergrande's problems add to concerns about a liquidity squeeze in the property sector. It also has coupon payments totalling more than $255 million on its June 2023 and 2025 bonds due on Dec. 28. 
China's property woes nL4N2RI1AS rattled global markets in September and October. There was a brief lull in mid-October after Beijing tried to reassure markets the crisis would not be allowed to spiral out of control. 
But concerns have resurfaced, with the U.S. Federal Reserve warning on Tuesday that China's property sector could pose global risks.
More developers are seeing their credit ratings slashed on their worsening financial profiles.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded Kaisa Group, which on Tuesday made a desperate plea https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-state-council-held-meeting-with-property-developers-banks-source-2021-11-09/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFinancial%20stresses%20in%20China%20could,twice-yearly%20financial%20stability%20report for help, citing liquidity risks, limited financial flexibility and weak recovery prospects for its creditors.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer, after Evergrande. The developer has coupon payments of more than $59 million due on Thursday and Friday.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said separately it had downgraded Shimao Group Holdings' rating to ""BB+"" from ""BBB-"" over concerns that tough business conditions would hinder the company's efforts to reduce debt.
S&P considers a rating under ""BBB-"" to be speculative grade.

Worries over the potential fallout from Evergrande have also slammed the bonds https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-state-council-held-meeting-with-property-developers-banks-source-2021-11-09 of Chinese real estate companies.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 06:21PM ET</span>",Boeing to compensate victims in Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing Co agreed on Wednesday to acknowledge liability for compensatory damages in lawsuits filed by families of the 157 people killed in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Chicago.
As a result of the agreement between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and the families, lawyers for the victims will not seek punitive damages and Boeing will not challenge the lawsuits being filed in Illinois. 
""Boeing is committed to ensuring that all families who lost loved ones in the accidents are fully and fairly compensated for their loss,"" the planemaker said in a statement on Wednesday. ""By accepting responsibility, Boeing’s agreement with the families allows the parties to focus their efforts on determining the appropriate compensation for each family.""
Lawyers for the victims noted in a statement that Boeing admitted under the agreement ""that the 737 MAX had an unsafe condition, and that it will not attempt to blame anyone else"" for the crash.
""This is a significant milestone for the families in their pursuit of justice against Boeing, as it will ensure they are all treated equitably and eligible to recover full damages under Illinois law while creating a pathway for them to proceed to a final resolution, whether through settlements or trial,"" the lawyers said.
They added the compensation ""will serve to hold Boeing fully accountable for the deaths of the 157 people who perished.""
A judge has set a hearing for next Tuesday on the agreement.
Boeing's best-selling plane was grounded for 20 months after 346 people died in two 737 MAX crashes - in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019. The plane returned to service after Boeing made significant software and training improvements.
The crashes already have cost Boeing some $20 billion. In January, Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes, including the Lion Air crash in October 2018.

In an interview, U.S. consumer activist Ralph Nader criticized the deal since it will prevent lawyers from questioning current and former Boeing senior executives and pursuing the punitive damage claims. Nader’s niece was among 157 victims.
Under the deal with Boeing, the victims' families also agreed to dismiss claims against Rosemount Aerospace, a company that made sensors for the 737 MAX, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), the parent of Rosemount and a key supplier for the MAX.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday that nine pork plants can apply to operate faster processing-line speeds under a one-year trial, after a federal judge in March struck down a Trump-era rule that removed line speed limits.
Faster slaughtering would help meat companies like WH Group (OTC:WHGLY)'s Smithfield Foods and JBS USA, a unit of Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) , boost pork production at a time of strong demand and high bacon prices.
The companies, and others like  Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL) supplier Quality Pork Processors, are eligible to apply for the trial program because they were previously able to accelerate processing under the earlier rule. 
A federal judge invalidated the 2019 rule after the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union sued the USDA over concerns about worker safety.
Some activists criticized USDA for starting a new waiver program.
""With this decision, the Biden administration is caving to industry pressure,"" said Zach Corrigan, senior attorney for Food & Water Watch.
But the UFCW, America's largest union for meatpacking workers, said the program will create a mechanism to collect data that shows how to protect workers and promote food safety.
In the pilot program, plants will implement worker safety measures under agreements with labor unions or worker safety committees, the USDA said.
Plants will collect data on how line speeds affect workers and share it with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the USDA said. The data could be used to make future rules for the industry.
Meat companies welcomed the program as an ""opportunity to restore lost production and help ease supply chain challenges but will need to examine further the specific requirements for participation,"" said the North American Meat Institute, an industry group representing major meatpackers. 

Pork companies lost 2.5% of their slaughtering capacity following the March court decision, the National Pork Producers Council said.
Futures traders said the pilot program announcement boosted Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog futures amid concerns that slower processing speeds had reduced meatpackers' demand for pigs to slaughter. December lean hogs ended up 0.750 cent at 75.700 cents per pound on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -A U.S. jury on Wednesday ordered  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) to pay $62 million to students and others who say they were exposed to toxic chemicals made by the company's predecessor,  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co, in a school building in Washington state.
    The verdict was the second against Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) over polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, at the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe, Washington.
A trial involving three teachers ended in a $185 million verdict in July, including $135 million in punitive damages, which Bayer is appealing. 
Bayer said it would challenge the verdict through post-trial motions, and that ""undisputed evidence in this case does not support the conclusions that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs"" at the school.
Nearly 200 people, including students, parents and staff, have sued Bayer over the alleged contamination resulting from exposure to PCBs found in fluorescent light ballasts at Sky Valley, and 19 more trials are scheduled.
The plaintiffs assert they suffered health problems, including asthma and cognitive impairment. Bayer has said the lighting components were produced decades ago by Monsanto customers and installed in the 1960s.
Wednesday's verdict, which includes $35 million in punitive damages, followed a trial involving eight plaintiffs: four students, three parents and a band member who practiced at the school.
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, as well as in caulking, floor finish and paint. The U.S. government outlawed them in 1979 after they were linked to cancer and other health problems.

Monsanto, which Bayer bought for $63 billion in 2018, produced PCBs from 1935 to 1977.
In December, a federal judge rejected Bayer's proposed $648 million settlement of separate class-action litigation by cities and other claimants over wastewater contaminated with PCBs made by Monsanto. The company has said it expects a revised version of the deal to be approved.

In addition, the passage of an infrastructure bill in the U.S. is expected to boost oil demand further. And because OPEC and its allies are reluctant to change their stance on limiting the supply of oil, oil prices should keep rallying. Given this backdrop, we think the low-priced stocks of oil & gas concerns Tellurian (NYSE:TELL) and Kosmos (KOS) could be ideal additions to one’s portfolio now, considering these companies’ fundamental strength. Read on.Oil and gas prices are soaring on the back of robust demand with the reopening of the economy. According to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, global oil demand has almost reclaimed pre-pandemic levels. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading near its highest level since 2014. Oil prices were trading at a two-week high on November 9, with Brent crude rising 1.6% to settle at $84.78 per barrel and WTI crude climbing 2.7% to $84.15. The the bipartisan infrastructure spending bill passed by Congress this week is expected to boost economic growth and the oil demand further.
OPEC and its allies are reluctant to ramp up the oil supply. After much insistence from the U.S. government, the cartel agreed to a 400,000 barrel-a-day production hike for December, which is insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, oil prices could keep ascending.
Given the rising prices, we think the shares of Tellurian Inc. (TELL) and  Kosmos Energy Ltd . (NYSE:KOS), which are currently trading at less than $10, could be solid additions to one’s portfolio.

(Reuters) - The chief executive of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games and other vocal critics of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google plan to speak in South Korea, where the two American tech giants face new regulations forcing them to open their app stores to third-party payments.
Tim Sweeney and representatives from Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) plan to speak at a conference next week about fairness in online ecosystems, according to a representative for the companies.
Sweeney's visit to Korea comes a day after a U.S. judge denied Apple's request https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-judge-skeptical-apples-request-pause-fortnite-antitrust-orders-2021-11-09 to pause a set of court orders handed down after a lengthy antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games. Those orders could require Apple to allow developers to create in-app buttons and links to third-party payment systems.
In August, South Korean lawmakers amended the country's Telecommunication Business Act. Under the change, the operators of app stores would have to allow third-party payment systems in their stores instead of forcing developers to use in-app payment systems that charge commissions.
The Korean Communications Commission (KCC) has asked both Apple and Google to submit compliance plans. 
Last week, Google said it had submitted a plan https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-plans-allow-third-party-payments-systems-skorea-2021-11-04 that would for the first time allow third-party payments, but it is unclear whether the plan will lower costs for developers.

Rather than charge its standard 15% commission for the use of its in-app payment system, Google said it will charge developers who use their own payment system an 11% commission. Those developers will likely pay an additional 3% to 4% in fees to an outside payment processor.
Apple has not said whether it has submitted a compliance plan. In October, a Korean official told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15 Apple has told regulators it does not believe it needs to make any changes to its current business practices, potentially putting the iPhone maker on a collision course with regulators.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets edged lower and the dollar gained on Wednesday after U.S. consumer inflation surged to its highest since 1990, raising concerns the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected.
Gold prices hit a five-month high as the Labor Department reported another jump in the consumer price index in October, bolstering the metal's appeal as a hedge against inflation. Real yields on U.S. Treasuries slid to record lows.
CPI rose 0.9% on a monthly basis after rising 0.4% in September as the largest gain in four months boosted the annual increase to 6.2%. It was the biggest year-on-year rise since November 1990 and followed a 5.4% leap in September. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall CPI to rise 0.6%.
""It's tough for policymakers to ignore this report because the gains were so broadly distributed,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.
George Mateyo, chief investment officer of Key Private Bank in Cleveland, said the term transitory should be terminated. ""The case is closed that inflation is likely to be a little stickier than we would have thought,"" he added.
""We're in a moment right now where the Fed has to play catch up and maybe start to consider raising interest rates next year,"" Mateyo said.
The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, touched its highest level in nearly one month.
(Graphic: US CPI: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movanlqqepa/Pasted%20image%201636552297844.png)
MSCI's all-country world index slid 0.71% as a decline on Wall Street accelerated. But the broad STOXX Europe 600 index rose 0.22% to end at a record closing high following strong earnings from the media and energy sectors. 
Profits of companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to jump 60.7% in the third quarter to 104.4 billion euros ($120.7 billion) from a year earlier, new Refinitiv data showed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.66%, the S&P 500 lost 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.66% as the big U.S. megacap names led the downturn. Growth stocks fell 1.26% but value shares just 0.29%.
Despite the slide on Wall Street the U.S. economy is booming and corporate pricing power is resilient, which means revenues can grow and lift profits too, Mateyo said.
""The overall takeaway from us is that economic growth can stay strong and somewhat upset these inflation pressures,"" he said.
The dollar jumped on the CPI data, with the euro hitting a 16-month low against the greenback. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.914% to 94.886.
The euro fell 0.97% at $1.1479, while the yen gained 0.95% at $113.9200. 
While investors expressed fear of an acceleration in price pressures near-term, longer-dated measures show they do not expect inflation to persist.
""We still think maybe the market's getting a little bit ahead of itself with those rate hikes,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. 
""Maybe the Fed continues to sort of hold its ground. You get a little bit of a dovish pivot from the markets because they might be pressing a little bit too aggressive of a rate path, at least for the next year,"" he said.
The Treasury breakeven inflation curve, a measure of what inflation level an investor would break even with on a given Treasury note yield, shows investors expect inflation to run at 4.72% in the coming year, before declining to 3.59% in two years, 3.14% in five years and 2.67% in 10 years.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 11.4 basis points to 1.5630% in late trade on Wednesday, after touching a six-week low of 1.4150% on Tuesday.
Euro zone bond yields also ticked up, with Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the bloc, up 4 basis points at -0.243%, above a seven-week low of -0.299% touched on Tuesday. [GVD/EUR]
Oil prices slumped, hit by the surging dollar, after President Joe Biden said the U.S. administration was looking for ways to reduce energy costs amid a broader surge in inflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A partner at the McKinsey consulting firm was criminally charged on Wednesday with insider trading ahead of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s agreement to buy fintech lender GreenSky Inc for $2.24 billion, U.S. prosecutors said.
Puneet Dikshit, 40, of Manhattan, faces two securities fraud counts after allegedly generating about $450,000 of profit from 2,500 GreenSky call options that he bought in the two days before the merger was announced https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-buy-lender-greensky-224-billion-deal-2021-09-15 on Sept. 15.
Authorities said Dikshit led McKinsey's unsecured lending practice in North America and had been a lead partner advising Goldman. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
McKinsey said it has fired Dikshit for ""a gross violation of our policies and code of conduct. We have zero tolerance for the appalling behavior described in the complaint and we will continue cooperating with the authorities.""
Dikshit was arrested on Wednesday morning, and bail was set at $1 million at his initial appearance before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan. Lawyers for the defendant did not respond to requests for comment.
GreenSky is a specialty lender that arranges consumer loans for large one-time purchases such as home remodeling, cosmetic surgery and dental implants.
Its share price rose 53% on the day the merger was announced, and had been volatile on the three prior trading days, when options trading was particularly busy https://www.reuters.com/article/greensky-m-a-goldman-sachs-options/well-timed-trades-in-greensky-options-ahead-of-goldman-deal-raise-eyebrows-idUSKBN2GD23S.
Prosecutors said Dikshit bought his call options, a bet the stock price would rise, without receiving pre-clearance from McKinsey, and sold them shortly after the merger was announced.
They also said that following media reports of suspicious trading in the options, Dikshit sought permission to trade in GreenSky, and was denied.
Goldman was not charged or accused of wrongdoing.
The charges were announced nine years after former McKinsey chief and Goldman director Rajat Gupta was convicted of insider trading for passing tips about the Wall Street bank, including a pending investment from Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) 

Prosecutors said Dikshit ran Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches related to Gupta's conviction about three weeks after Goldman agreed to buy GreenSky.
The cases are U.S. v. Dikshit, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-mj-10772; and SEC v. Dikshit in the same court, No. 21-09289.

Walt Disney announced earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue of $18.53 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 51 cents on revenue of $18.82 billion.

(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis producer Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF) Inc's third-quarter revenue surged nearly 49% to beat estimates on Wednesday, thanks to more distribution channels and higher traffic at its retail stores.
A record number of Americans took to using cannabis products for recreation during last year's months-long lockdowns and now, retail stores are reaping the benefits as both new and old customers visit after pandemic curbs ease. 
""American consumers are overwhelmingly choosing cannabis for well being. People are demanding this product and we only see that growing,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben Kovler told Reuters in an interview.
Kovler estimated the U.S. cannabis industry is currently worth $24 billion in annual sales, in line with independent research data, and expects it could triple in size over the next decade as new states, products and consumers enter the market.
New marijuana sector-friendly policy changes, including access to federal banking and expectations of federal decriminalization of marijuana, have sparked optimism among investors in the industry. 
""We believe that American consumers will consume $80 billion of annual cannabis and that means that there's at least $50 billion more of legal sales to come in the next decade,"" Kovler said.
Chicago-based Green Thumb's profit more than doubled to $20.2 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 

Revenue rose to $233.7 million from $157.1 million last year, narrowly beating a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $233.3 million.
Green Thumb, which has 16 manufacturing facilities, 66 retail outlets and operations across 14 U.S. states, said its retail revenue increased 7.3% sequentially, as it opened new stores and more people walked into the older ones.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Wednesday, led by tech after data showing consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in more than three decades stoked fresh concerns about elevated inflation and sooner-than-expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 fell 0.82%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.66%, or 228 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.6%.
The Labor Department said Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.9% last month after edging up 0.4% in September, lifting the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 6.2%, the fastest pace since 1990.
The faster pace of inflation stoked expectations for a faster pace of tightening from the Fed, supporting a jump in Treasury yields.
“The December FOMC meeting is likely to see the dot plot pull forward the first hike into 2022,” Soctiabank Economics said in a note.
“While the FOMC has pre-committed to the taper path in December, inflation and nonfarm readings like we’ve received may also indicate a bias on the committee toward expediting tapering over 2022H1 at the same meeting.”
Consumer spending, which is a key contributor to economic growth and has so far been resilient, will likely run out of steam should elevated inflation continue.
“I don't think the level of consumer spending is very sustainable,"" Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs, told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""The most concerning thing is that the rise in everyday items people depend upon, will force them to cut back their discretionary spending somewhat.""
The backdrop of rising rates and inflation, which soured investor sentiment on growth stocks, weighed on the technology stocks.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was one of the biggest decliners in the big tech group after the European Union's General Court upheld the European Commission’s 2017 order that it pay a $2.8 antitrust fine.
As well as rising yields, tech was dragged lower by a 2% decline in chip stocks, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) leading to the downside. 
Energy also weighed on the broader market, pressured by a slip in oil prices following a rise in weekly crude stockpiles. The increase in inventory was 1 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels.
 Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) was down more than 8%, but cut some of its losses as some on Wall Street continued to tout optimism on the cryptocurrency exchange platform despite third-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines.
“Despite the quarterly miss, we point to a number of positive quarterly metrics: Both trading volumes and MTUs exceeded Street's expectations; the mix from nontrading revenues was up from the prior quarter's 5% to 13%; and assets on the platform ($255B) were up 600%+, also in-line with expectations,” Wedbush said in a note.
 Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) delivered fourth-quarter revenue guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations after reporting a wider than expected loss in the third quarter amid weaker than expected revenue. Its shares slid 29%.
In other news, electric-truck maker  Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) made its public market debut in style, surging 28% above its $78 IPO price. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford own a 20% and 12% stake in Rivian, respectively."
889,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>","U.S. judge temporarily halts Johnson & Johnson talc cases, moves them to New Jersey","By Maria Chutchian
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) -A U.S. judge gave Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) a temporary reprieve from tens of thousands of claims that its talc-based products cause cancer, but handed the drugmaker a potential setback by moving the cases to a court where the outcomes might be less favorable.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Craig Whitley in Charlotte, North Carolina, put the claims on hold for 60 days, while directing that they be moved to a federal court in New Jersey.
The judge said at a hearing that New Jersey was the ""most natural fit"" for the claims because J&J is based there, and the state is home to much of the nationwide litigation over its talc products.
Shares of J&J were up 1% at $164.10 in late afternoon trading.
J&J has maintained that its talc products are safe.
While New Jersey is its home state, J&J wanted the claims to stay in North Carolina because of that court's experience with so-called ""mass tort"" bankruptcies, and because of favorable legal precedents.
""Although we believe this case was properly venued in North Carolina, we will continue to work with all parties to seek an efficient and equitable resolution,"" said John Kim, chief legal officer of LTL Management LLC.
J&J created LTL to hold its talc liabilities shortly before placing it into bankruptcy, where it hopes to settle the talc claims separate from the parent company.
That effort has been challenged by talc users who later got cancer, as well as by their families.
Their lawyers have argued that J&J should not reap the benefits of bankruptcy protection when it has not filed for bankruptcy itself and is financially strong.
They also said shielding J&J would interfere with upcoming trials, amounting to an unprecedented ""overreach"" in mass tort bankruptcy cases.
Andy Birchfield, a lawyer at Beasley Allen representing many plaintiffs, in a statement said ""any justice delayed is justice denied"" but welcomed the claims being moved.
J&J ""should not be able to manipulate the bankruptcy system - in any state - to avoid liability for decades of corporate negligence, and the resulting deaths and disease suffered by thousands of victims,"" he said.
J&J has spent close to $1 billion defending against nearly 40,000 legal claims that its baby powder and other talc-containing products caused mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. 
Settlements and verdicts have cost the New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company about $3.5 billion more, although it has prevailed in some cases.

LTL had argued that letting the litigation proceed would defeat the purpose of the bankruptcy, which was to consolidate and settle all talc claims.
It also said the litigation would reduce insurance proceeds available for a settlement, because the same policies covered J&J and LTL.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 involved in a fatal Sept. 13 crash in Coral Gables was traveling at a high rate of speed before it crashed into two trees and caught fire, according to a preliminary https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/HWY21FH011.aspxreport.
The crash occurred on a residential street with a 30-mile per hour speed limit and resulted in the deaths of the 20-year-old driver and a 19-year-old passenger. 
The NTSB said it recovered about 5 seconds of pre-crash and crash data from the vehicle's event data recorder (EDR). Preliminary evaluation of the data indicated ""the maximum recorded vehicle speed was 90 mph.""
NTSB repaired and installed the damaged data chip from the EDR and installed into an another recorder so the data could be retrieved. NTSB said ""preliminary evaluation of the data indicated that application of the accelerator pedal ranged from 0 to 100%, the service brake remained off.""
The 2021 Tesla at 8:55 p.m. was traveling north on Alhambra Circle as it approached the signal-light-controlled intersection with Coral Way and ""passed another car and accelerated as it neared the yellow signal light at the intersection,"" the NTSB said.
The Tesla continued north through the intersection, traveled about 140 feet and the left front of the car struck a tree, rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and then collided with a second tree, NTSB said.
A postcrash fire badly destroyed the vehicle. ""Firefighters faced challenges in extinguishing the fire and reported that the vehicle’s batteries reignited at least once,"" the NTSB said.

The fire destroyed much of the vehicle’s interior.
Tesla vehicles have large battery packs that sometimes have been involved in lengthy fires after crashes and NTSB has investigated numerous fires of Tesla vehicles after crashes.

892,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 03:39PM ET</span>","Rivian, Inflation Effects, Oil Market: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com -- Tech stocks tumbled on Wednesday after data showing U.S. consumer prices rose the most in 31 years, stoking fears that inflation is not backing down. 
The consumer price index rose 6.2% in the 12 months through October, according to the Labor Department. That’s the biggest yearly move higher since November 1990.
On Tuesday producer prices data showed a rise in October. Manufacturers are passing higher costs to consumers, whose spending contributes two-thirds of U.S. economic output.
The big deal of the day was the public debut of electric truck maker Rivian, which soared 30% on its first day and had a market value greater than that of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). 
Wednesday's losses also came after data showed Chinese factory gate prices hit a 26-year high in October, Reuters reported, while economic advisers to the German government said they expected the current rise in inflation to continue well into 2022.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow, when the bond market is closed in the U.S. for Veteran's Day:
1. Rivian IPO still dazzles
 Rivian Automotive  Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) made a strong start to life as a public company on Wednesday, with its shares soaring on its debut in what was one of the largest IPOs ever. The American electric vehicle company priced its offering at $78 and the stock's first trade was at $106.75, almost 37% above the IPO price. Investors will no doubt continue to watch it trade on Thursday to see if it can keep rising.
2. Inflation spooks market
People are starting to believe that the “transitory” inflation the Federal Reserve keeps talking about is not so transitory after-all. The Labor Department's report on consumer prices on Wednesday could influence the central back to move more quickly on pulling back stimulus.
3. Speaking of fuel prices...
U.S. oil stockpiles rose less than expected in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, 1 million barrels against expectations for 2.1 million barrels. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, declined by 2 million barrels. Oil trades at around $81 a barrel. The Biden administration has said it will work to rein in rising fuel prices heading into the winter months as Americans face higher costs for heating their homes.

However, because the central bank may not raise interest rates anytime soon, and the greenback remains stable, rising investment demand for gold is driving its prices higher. Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally sound gold mining stocks Centerra (CGAU), Torex (TORXF), and Jaguar (JAGGF) could be solid bets now.Gold has relatively little use in industry, which leaves its buying and selling to the whim of investors, which is partly the reason gold is such a widely used hedge against currency fluctuations. This is also the reason yellow metal prices are susceptible to monetary policy changes.
Gold prices had fallen to a four-month low in early August to $1,677.90 per ounce due to a rush to buy U.S. dollars in lieu of gold as the Fed signaled a prospective hike in interest rates. However, spot gold prices rebounded quickly to trade at $1,828.74 per ounce earlier this week, its highest price since September. The rebound can be attributed to the central bank’s intention to not raise the benchmark interest rates anytime soon. Furthermore, analysts expect gold prices to be buoyed by a decline in U.S. Treasury yields after this week’s Producer Price Index showed that wholesale inflation is decelerating.
Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally sound gold mining stocks of Centerra Gold Inc. (CGAU), Torex Gold Resources Inc. (OTC:TORXF), and Jaguar Mining Inc. (OTC:JAGGF) could be solid bets now.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>",Exxon 'back on track' to meet target to double earnings -CEO,"By Sabrina Valle
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday the company is confident it will hit a target to double earnings and cash flow from operations, adding that consumers and governments must decide how quickly the world moves to cleaner fuels. 
Oil and gas prices have reached multi-year highs this year, boosting results across the energy industry. The largest U.S. oil producer posted a historic loss of $22.4 billion in 2020 as oil prices tanked amid low fuel consumption during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""We are back on track to deliver the growth and earnings and cash flow we anticipated,"" CEO Darren Woods said in an online event organized by the New York Times. 
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) can grow results ""with a lot less capital."" Its recent cost cutting coupled with higher energy prices provides ""capital that we can put into (share) buybacks,"" Woods said.
Exxon set a target in 2018 of increasing earnings to $31 billion by 2025 – from 2017’s adjusted profit of $15 billion, excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Last year, Exxon said it would meet the target by 2027 https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1130_ExxonMobil-to-prioritize-capital-investments-on-high-value-assets. 
""We believe we will meet that,"" Woods said.
Low-carbon fuels and technologies come with a cost and it will be up to governments, society and consumers - not oil producers - to decide how fast the energy transition will happen, Woods added. 

""Do you pay more to transition more quickly?"" Woods asked. ""It is difficult for a company to answer that question.""
Earlier this month, Exxon said it would spend up to $15 billion on lower-carbon technologies over the next six years. It also plans to buy back up to $10 billion worth of its shares over 24 months, starting next year.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Wednesday, led by tech after data showing consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in more than three decades stoked fresh concerns about elevated inflation and sooner-than-expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.70%, or 254 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.8%.
The Labor Department said Thursday its consumer price index rose 0.9% last month after edging up 0.4% in September, lifting the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 6.2%, the fastest pace since 1990.
The faster pace of inflation stoked expectations for a faster pace of tightening from the Fed, supporting a jump in Treasury yields.
“The December FOMC meeting is likely to see the dot plot pull forward the first hike into 2022,” Soctiabank Economics said in a note.
“While the FOMC has pre-committed to the taper path in December, inflation and nonfarm readings like we’ve received may also indicate a bias on the committee toward expediting tapering over 2022H1 at the same meeting.”
Consumer spending, which is a key contributor to economic growth and has so far been resilient, will likely run out of steam should elevated inflation continue.
“I don't think the level of consumer spending is very sustainable,"" Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs, told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""The most concerning thing is that the rise in everyday items people depend upon, will force them to cut back their discretionary spending somewhat.""
The backdrop of rising rates and inflation, which soured investor sentiment on growth stocks, weighed on the technology stocks.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was one of the biggest decliners in the big tech group after the European Union's General Court upheld the European Commission’s 2017 order that it pay a $2.8 antitrust fine.
Energy also weighed on the broader market, pressured by a slip in oil prices following a rise in weekly crude stockpiles. The increase in inventory was 1 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels.

Investing.com - Bitcoin slipped from record highs Wednesday, as investors appeared to cool some of their bullish bets even as the popular cryptocurrency appears to be enhancing its reputation as an inflation hedge.
Bitcoin fell 0.40% to $66,528.4, but had earlier hit a record high of $68,990.
The earlier rally in BTC comes as concern about elevated inflation heats up following data showing U.S. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace since 1990. 
""If there was any lingering doubt, this morning’s inflation report confirms consumer prices are officially out of control,"" Stifel said in a note.
In the wake of elevated inflation, bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value, or “digital gold” - given its limited supply and its outsized returns over a long period – has strengthened its narrative as a hedge against elevated price pressures.
The retreat from record highs comes even as signs emerged earlier this week that investors continue to move BTC from exchanges to private storage, pointing to ongoing investor appetite to hold the popular crypto for the long term.
“Despite hovering just below ATHs, on-chain activity remains only marginally above bear market levels. Additionally, exchange balances continue to deplete, and miner hashrate and USD revenue are approaching new highs,” Glassnode said in its weekly report published earlier this week.  
Others, meanwhile, attributed the recent rally in bitcoin to expectations for an influx of bitcoin futures exchange traded fund applications in the coming days ahead of the Securities and Exchange Commission deadline on Nov. 14.
“Optimism is growing in the market … this push could be caused by ETF anticipations, so be aware of the SEC deadline on November 14th,” Arcane Research added."

""I look at how dedicated our workforce is, we will work through it. I'm betting on them.""
U.S. employers are gearing up to comply with rules issued by the Joe Biden Administration that require companies with at least 100 employees to get their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to regular testing.

899,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 02:54PM ET</span>",Evergrande Pays Delayed Interest on at Least Two Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group has made at least two overdue bond interest payments, part of its biggest test yet since its debt crisis began. 
The company made at least two of three overdue interest payments on its U.S. Dollar-dominated bonds, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Its dollar securities remain at distressed levels as creditors brace for an eventual debt restructuring that could rank among the largest ever in China.
Investors had been waiting to see if the embattled developer would make coupon payments totaling $148.1 million for three dollar bonds before the end of 30-day grace periods Wednesday. Evergrande missed the initial interest deadlines last month, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
The affected bonds include a 9.5% note due 2022, 10% bonds due 2023, and its 10.5% note due 2024. 
The property giant pulled back from the brink of default in October by paying other coupons before the end of its grace period. But the crisis at Asia’s largest junk bond issuer is hardly over, as it grapples with more than $300 billion in liabilities. A string of other developers have also fallen into distress amid a crackdown on speculation and leverage following years of debt-fueled expansion. The contagion has even spread to other areas of the credit market.
On Monday, two holders of other dollar notes sold by a unit of China Evergrande said they hadn’t received payment for coupons that were officially due Saturday. Both of those coupons also have a 30-day grace period before any missed payment would be considered a default.
A representative for Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. 
Authorities have sought to limit the fallout from the wider property market distress, with the central bank injecting liquidity into the financial system. Chinese developers’ bonds and stocks rallied Wednesday after the Securities Times said authorities are likely to loosen controls for the nation’s real estate companies to issue local-currency notes, part of efforts to prevent a further deterioration in their financing.
But concerns persist. A string of defaults and downgrades in the property industry in recent weeks pushed yields on junk dollar bonds from Chinese issuers to the highest in at least a decade over 24%.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) said on Wednesday its pension trust would sell the shares it holds in French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), unwinding cross-shareholdings, but added that its industrial collaboration remained intact.
The pension trust would sell about 9.2 million ordinary shares in Renault via an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors after the market close on Wednesday.
Previous filings show that stake to be 3.1% of Renault's share capital and about 5% of the voting rights.
Renault shares closed 1.9% higher at 34.30 euros, valuing the Daimler stake at 316 million euros ($365 million) but block sales typically price at a discount to regular trading.
The offering marks the end of cross-shareholdings that have tied Daimler to Renault and its partner, Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, for a decade.
In 2016, Daimler had transferred its 3.1% of Renault-Nissan to its retirement assets. Renault and Nissan both sold their 1.5% each held in Daimler in early 2021 to help them overcome financial difficulties.
Renault, whose more accessible models contrast with Daimler's luxury brand Mercedes-Benz, was not immediately available for comment.

Under the three-way partnership, Daimler runs a factory in Mexico with Nissan while it cooperates on multi-purpose vehicles Kangoo and Citan with Renault, among other projects. Daimler has been exploring the possibility of jointly developing at least one large van model with Renault.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday that the agency will consider new rules that scrutinize how private funds charge investors and measure performance.
Gary Gensler, in a keynote address to members of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, added that agency rules would address how funds use separate agreements with investors, so-called ""side letters,"" as a work-around to fund constitutions. 
The regulator hopes the new rules would mitigate conflicts of interest between fund general partners, affiliates and investors.
Gensler also said he has asked staff for recommendations to enhance hedge fund reporting and disclosure through the agency's Form Private Fund (Form PF), which is required for annual or quarterly disclosure in some cases, to help shed light to regulators on the activities of private fund advisers.
""Private funds have multiple levels of fees — among others, management fees, performance fees and for many private equity funds, portfolio company fees,"" Gensler said.
""I wonder whether fund investors have enough transparency with respect to these fees.""
Armed with billions of dollars, buyout firms have taken advantage of what has been a record year for mergers and acquisitions, selling some of their assets for top dollar.
Private equity-backed M&A deals more than doubled to a record $818.4 billion in the first nine months of this year, up from $315.2 billion last year, according to Refinitiv.
While large buyout deals have been few and far between this year, some private equity firms have banded together to acquire companies for huge sums, raising expectations that such 'club deals' could happen more often.
Gensler says he wants to get a better look at the fees associated with such mega deals, revealing that many investors have flagged that they routinely find themselves billed for extra costs. 

Side letters are agreements separate from a fund's constituting documents that are often used to negotiate concessions between a fund and an investor in cases where an investor has specific commercial, legal, regulatory, taxation or operational concerns. 
More disclosure by private funds adds to an already jam-packed agenda for the SEC, which is working on new corporate climate change-risk disclosures, cracking down on blank-check company deals and overhauling several aspects of the U.S. equity market structure.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:52PM ET</span>",Bulls creep back in to Tesla options after stock selloff,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bullish sentiment returned to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's options on Wednesday, as the stock swung between gains and losses following a sharp three-day selloff.
Tesla's shares fell 16% through Tuesday this week after Chief Executive Elon Musk took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-asks-followers-twitter-whether-he-should-sell-10-his-tesla-stock-2021-11-06 over the weekend to ask his followers if he should sell 10% of his stake in the company as Washington proposes to hike taxes for the super-wealthy. Nearly 58% said they would support such a sale. 
Shares were recently up 3.6% on the day at $1,060.75, after dropping earlier in the session and briefly putting Tesla’s market value below $1 trillion.
Record buying of short-term bullish call options on Tesla in past weeks has helped fuel the stock's recent swings, including a sharp rally in October that vaulted Tesla’s valuation above $1 trillion, analysts said.
The tumble in the stock swung options bets in Tesla toward the bearish side, with trading in puts surpassing trading in calls for the first time in about two weeks on Tuesday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. 
Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts provide the right to sell the shares.
On Wednesday, upside bets were back in vogue with call options outnumbering puts by a ratio of 1.3-to-1. On Tuesday, only 0.8 calls traded for every put. 
The rapid shifts by market participants likely reflects attempts to profit from the stock’s momentum, rather than fixed opinions on which way shares are heading over the long term, said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at Ally Invest.
""It is the speculative nature of the stock,"" Overby said.
On Wednesday, call options that would pay out if the stock finished above $1,100 and $1,200 by Friday were two of the most heavily traded contracts. 
While some of these may be closing trades with options expiry around the corner, overall sentiment on Wednesday leaned bullish, according to Trade Alert.
Tesla options accounted for about $109 billion in premium changing hands over the last two weeks, or about one in every three dollars traded in the U.S. listed options market, the bulk of it in bullish call contracts, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data. 

Hedging activity from market makers, who may have taken the other side of at least a portion of these trades, was likely responsible for exacerbating the rally and the latest tumble in Tesla, according to a report from Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research.
With the bulk of open Tesla call options set to expire this week and next, there is a ""not negligible"" risk that further options-driven selling will lead to a larger pullback for the stock, Vanda's analysts wrote.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:52PM ET</span>","Exclusive-U.S. warns against IP, trade secret risks in draft EU tech rules - paper","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Draft landmark EU rules requiring U.S. tech giants to share information with rivals could put at risk companies' intellectual property and trade secrets, the United States government warned in a document seen by Reuters.
The paper said requiring gatekeepers - companies that control data and access to their platforms - to change their business practices and the design of their software may have implications for security and consumer protection.
The document, circulated to EU countries, the European Commission and involved companies, underlines U.S. concerns that the rules will come at the expense of U.S. companies.
Frustrated by the slow pace of investigations, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has proposed two sets of rules to rein in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out a list of dos and don'ts that takes direct aim at each company's core business model, reinforced by fines of up to 10% of global turnover.
The Digital Services Act (DSA) forces the tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms, with fines of up to 6% of global turnover for non-compliance.
""DMA would require gatekeepers under certain circumstances to provide competitors with information that may be protected by intellectual property and trade secret law,"" the document said.
""However, the DMA does not include specific language relevant to the protection of intellectual property, including trade secrets.""
""As a result, there is a concern that the DMA may override existing protections for intellectual property rights, including protection for trade secrets, in EU law under certain circumstances.""
The U.S. government declined to comment on the document.
""Broadly speaking, the Biden administration has been consulting with stakeholders and reviewing both the DMA and the DSA,"" a U.S. government official told Reuters.
""We have also been clear that we oppose efforts specifically designed to target only U.S. companies,"" the official said.
The document also warned against imposing onerous obligations on cloud service providers, saying they may be neutral transporters of data from one point to another and that the EU should reconsider the size of fines and penalties.

On the DSA, the paper said illegal content should be defined narrowly ""to ensure it will not be a source of conflicts of law nor a benefit to member states who have shown a tendency to reduce press and association freedoms"".
The rules should clarify the geographic scope of a platform's obligation to take down illegal content, the paper said, amid worries that an EU country may issue a pan-European order.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:47PM ET</span>","Retailers lose love for Asia: Snarled supply chains force manufacturing exodus to Balkans, LatAm","By Siddharth Cavale and Corina Pons
(Reuters) - Major clothing and shoe companies are moving production to countries closer to their U.S. and European stores, smarting from a resurgence in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Vietnam and China that slowed or shut down production for several weeks earlier this year. 
The disclosures come amid a massive shipping logjam that is driving up costs and forcing companies to rethink their globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs in Asia.. 
The latest example is Spanish fashion retailer Mango, which told Reuters on Friday it has ""accelerated"" its process of increasing local production in countries such as Turkey, Morocco and Portugal. In 2019, the company largely sourced its products from China and Vietnam. Mango told Reuters that it would ""considerably"" expand the number of units manufactured locally in Europe in 2022. 
Similarly, U.S. shoe retailer Steve Madden on Wednesday said it had pulled back production in Vietnam and had shifted 50% of its footwear production to Brazil and Mexico from China, while Rubber clogs maker  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) said last month it was moving production to countries including Indonesia and Bosnia. 
Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, Morocco and Turkey were some of the countries drawing new interest from clothing and shoe producers, though China continues to produce a large share of the apparel for U.S. and European clothing chains. 
""We are seeing a lot of growth in freight and trucking activity in the former Soviet Republics ... a big rise in Hungary and Romania,"" said Barry Conlon, chief executive of Overhaul, a supply chain risk management firm. 
In Turkey, apparel exports are expected to reach $20 billion this year, an all-time high, driven by a spike in orders from the European Union, Turkey’s Union of Chambers Clothing and Garment Council data showed. In 2020, exports totaled $17 billion. 
In Bosnia & Herzegovina, exports of textiles, leather and footwear amounted to 739.56 million marka ($436.65 million) in the first half of 2021, which was higher than for all of 2020. 
""Many companies from the European Union, which is our most important trading partner, are looking for new suppliers and new supply chains in the Balkan market,"" said Professor Muris Pozderac, secretary of the association of textile, clothing, leather and footwear in Bosnia & Herzegovina.
In Guatemala, where Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) significantly shifted its private-label volume production in 2020, clothing exports were a touch over $1 billion as of the end of August this year, up 34.2% from 2020 and even 8.8% higher than in 2019. 
To be sure, many companies are also still heavily reliant on Vietnam, where recent production stoppages have caused significant disruptions. Vietnam’s government said in October that it will fall short of its garment exports target this year, by $5 billion in a worst-case scenario, due to the impacts of coronavirus restrictions and a shortage of workers. 
Factory inspections in Vietnam - a proxy for retailer manufacturing orders - fell 40% in the third quarter versus the second quarter, with production during those months quickly moving to Bangladesh, India and Cambodia. Inspection rates in Vietnam were still hovering at lower levels in the fourth quarter, with a small uptick seen in late October, said Mathieu Labasse, vice president of QIMA, a supply-chain quality control and auditing firm that represents more than 15,000 brands. 
Apparel maker VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) and outdoor gear maker  Columbia Sportswear  (NASDAQ:COLM) were among companies that warned that there would be delays in fall and spring collections and in some cases insufficient size assortments. 

Michael Kors handbags maker Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) said on Wednesday that it would not have the inventories it wanted for the holiday season, while athletic gear maker Under Armour (NYSE:UA) said on last Tuesday it was canceling purchase orders from Vietnam just to help get ""the factories get back up and caught up.""

The White House has said that unusually high inflation will drop once supply bottlenecks ease.
The FTC said it will vote on whether it should collect data from big retailers and other companies that supply consumer goods to study how supply chain disruptions have affected competition.

""The study will focus on why these disruptions occur, whether they are leading to specific bottlenecks, shortages, anticompetitive practices, or contributing to rising consumer prices,"" the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Major U.S. airlines and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s aviation unit are joining an effort to speed development and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to decrease emissions in air transport.
The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) said Amazon Air, Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, and United Airlines are joining the effort, which includes major corporate airline customers, to help drive greater SAF production, price cuts and technological advancements.
The Environmental Defense Fund and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) launched the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) in April with companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to support increased market demand for SAFs.
At the climate talks in Glasgow https://www.reuters.com/business/cop, RMI managing director Bryan Fisher said aviation emissions would be equivalent to the sixth largest country's total emissions. Fisher said SAF is ""almost largely 100%"" of the solution through 2030 ""and still a very large part"" through 2050 but SAF is just 0.1% of jet fuel consumed today. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will represent the United States as a coalition of countries led by Britain are expected to announce the ""International Aviation Climate Ambition Declaration,"" Reuters reported, citing sources.
Buttigieg on Wednesday praised SABA and cited ""the importance of partnerships between the public and private sector"" in cutting aviation emissions.
On Tuesday, the United States said it was setting a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050.
The White House said in September it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030. Major U.S. airlines backed a voluntary industry target of 3 billion gallons of SAF use in 2030.
Ben Minicucci, CEO of Alaska Airlines, said the new ""Aviators Group"" within SABA is ""focused on tangible steps, at scale, to accelerate progress.""
SABA also said Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent Meta is joining.

""Making sustainable travel a reality will require extensive investment in low-carbon technologies such as sustainable aviation fuel by our entire industry,” said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
Nearly 2.5% of global emissions are a result of air travel.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",Factbox-Five ways newly public EV startup Rivian compares with Tesla,"By Ben Klayman and Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc made its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday after raising nearly $12 billion in an upsized offer that made it one of the largest ever initial public offerings.
Like other electric vehicle startups, Rivian aims to ride the growing demand for zero-emission vehicles to a position that rivals market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
While further back on the growth curve than Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, here are five areas where the Irvine, California-based Rivian and CEO R.J. Scaringe compare with the EV market leader.
MARKET CAP
Tesla, founded in 2003, is the most valuable carmaker in the world, but its stock declined recently after Musk polled Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users about selling 10% of his stake in the company. Despite briefly falling out of the $1 trillion market-value club on Wednesday, Tesla rallied and its market cap now stands at $1.05 trillion. 
Rivian, founded in 2009, made its Nasdaq market debut on Wednesday after its blockbuster IPO and initially was trading with a market capitalization of nearly $100 billion. That makes it the second most valuable U.S. automaker, ahead of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) at about $87 billion, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co at about $79 billion, and Lucid Group at about $70 billion.
GLOBAL SALES
Tesla delivered more than 600,000 vehicles from January to September this year. Once two additional factories under construction open later this year, sales will rise further. Tesla's revenue in the third quarter rose 57% to $13.76 billion from a year earlier. 
Rivian just started selling its first vehicle, the R1T pickup truck.
ASSEMBLY PLANTS/EMPLOYEES
Tesla has assembly plants in Fremont, California and near Shanghai and is building factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin. At the end of last year, Tesla employed almost 71,000 people globally.
The two existing plants will have annual production capacity of 1 million vehicles by the end of 2022, and that will double once two additional plants open, according to estimates by Wedbush.
Rivian has an assembly plant in Normal, Illinois that can build 150,000 vehicles a year and will expand to 200,000 by 2023. It has said it will build a second U.S. plant and eventually plans to add factories in China and Europe. Rivian currently employs 9,500 people.
Rivian's Scaringe told Reuters the company is aiming to build at least one million vehicles a year by the end of the decade.
TYPES OF VEHICLES
Tesla's Model 3 sedan is the best-selling electric car in the world. It also offers the Model S sedan, Model X SUV and Model Y crossover. It plans to eventually offer the Cybertruck electric pickup, a second-generation roadster and a Class 8 semi-trailer truck.
Rivian currently builds the R1T pickup in Illinois and will soon add the R1S SUV as well as a delivery van for its largest shareholder Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). It has said other vehicles off the R1 platform will be added by 2023, including lower-priced models according to Scaringe. It also plans to add other commercial vehicles on top of the Amazon van, he said.
PARTNERS

Tesla has taken more of a go-it-alone route, vertically integrating production of battery cells and design of self-driving chips.
Rivian has a deal to provide Amazon, which has a 20% stake in the startup, with 100,000 vans by 2025. In addition, Ford, another large stakeholder, has repeatedly said its investment in Rivian is strategic, even though it previously canceled the Lincoln SUV that would have been built on a Rivian platform. Rivian also intends to vertically integrate production of battery cells.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States Postal Service (USPS) on Wednesday reported a net loss of $4.9 billion for the year ending Sept. 30, narrowing its losses over the prior year.
USPS's operating revenue was $77 billion for the 2021 budget year, an increase of $3.9 billion, or 5.3%. It reported a 2020 net loss of $9.2 billion. 
Postmaster Louis DeJoy in March announced a plan to cut $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade. ""We have years of inflicted damage to fix that will necessitate us taking some continued uncomfortable actions,"" DeJoy said on Wednesday.
USPS said shipping and packages revenue increased by $3.5 billion in 2021, or 12.2%, largely driven by the surge in e-commerce resulting from record holiday volume.
First-class mail volumes fell to 50.7 billion pieces in 2021, the lowest number since 1971 https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-since-1926.htm, and is down 51% since 2001. 
USPS has struggled with poor delivery performance over the past year, facing a huge boost in packages and staffing issues due to COVID-19, but DeJoy said the agency was prepared for a busy holiday season. ""We are ready,"" he said.
Last month, the USPS implemented new service standards that slow some first-class mail deliveries as part of efforts to reduce red ink.
The new standards revised one- to three-day service standards to one to five days, impacting about 40% of first-class mail.
In late August, USPS raised prices of first-class stamps to 58 cents from 55 cents.
USPS has reported net losses of nearly $100 billion since 2007. That stems in part from 2006 legislation that required that the agency pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities, a requirement that labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses.

Congress is considering a plan to provide USPS with $46 billion in financial relief over 10 years, including eliminating the requirement that USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for 75 years.
Congress is separately considering awarding USPS $6 billion to purchase electric delivery vehicles and EV infrastructure.

(Reuters) -European stocks closed at a record high on Wednesday following strong earnings from the media and energy sectors, while technology stocks fell as fears of increased competition weighed on popular online food delivery companies. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2% at 483.76 points, with media and energy stocks among the top gainers. British broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV) surged 15.1% after it forecast record-high advertising revenue this year.
Siemens spin-off Siemens Energy advanced 3.5% after proposing a 0.10 euros per share dividend on strong free cash flow gains.
""We've seen strong earnings which have been fuelling rallies over the last few weeks, but there are concerns about firms' performance towards the end of the year - how this may start to cede and dampen their ability to push higher if prices continue to rise,"" said Daniela Sabin Hathorn, markets analyst at IG.
""Until we see a decisive move from central banks to change rates and show strength on their concerns about taming inflation, equity markets are going to remain strong.""
Profits of companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to jump 60.7% in the third quarter to 104.4 billion euros ($120.7 billion) from a year earlier, new Refinitiv data showed, a slight improvement from last week's 57.2% estimate.
Bank stocks rose 0.5%, tracking a rise in bond yields after data showed U.S. inflation rose more than expected. Precious metal miners also gained as gold prices benefited from increased hedging against inflation. [GVD/EUR] [GOL/]
Technology stocks were the biggest decliners for the day, losing 1.3%. Semiconductor maker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) slipped 1.2% even after beating quarterly sales estimates, as investors fretted over a global chip shortage.
Online food delivery stocks HelloFresh and Just Eat Takeaway.com slipped 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively, after U.S. peer DoorDash said it would buy Finland-based rival Wolt Enterprises in a deal valued at about 7 billion euros ($8.09 billion).
British retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) surged 16.5% to the top of the STOXX 600 after exceeding first-half profit forecasts and hiking its full-year outlook.

But the overall personal & household goods sector fell 0.4%, dragged down by a 3.7% fall in Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) after the German sportswear firm trimmed its 2021 forecasts due to sourcing disruptions and a challenging China market. 
Luxury stocks, including  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Hermes, Moncler, LVMH, and Burberry fell between 1% and 2.5% after data showing a rise in Chinese factory inflation fuelled concerns over stagflation in the country, which is a top buyer of luxury goods.

Although the agricultural e-commerce and technology enterprise Farmmi, Inc.’s (FAMI) revenues increased 31% year-over-year to $17.79 million in its last reported quarter, the stock has lost 74.1% in price over the past nine months and 70.7% over year-to-date.

GLASGOW (Reuters) - Automakers, airlines and governments unveiled a raft of pledges at the U.N. climate summit on Wednesday to slash greenhouse gas emissions from global transport, albeit with some conspicuous absences.
Driving, flying and shipping contribute nearly a quarter of the world’s manmade greenhouse gas emissions, making transport a valuable target in the effort to fight climate change. 
U.S. car makers Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) were among a group that committed to phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles by 2040, accelerating a shift towards electric motors from the internal combustion engines that they pioneered over a century ago. The world's second most populous country, India, joined the pledge.
But in a sign of the challenges of shifting to zero emissions, the world's top two car makers,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), did not sign up. Nor did China, the United States and Germany, all major vehicle markets.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has committed to having a CO2-neutral fleet globally by 2050.
Toyota has been making petroleum/electric hybrid vehicles for more than two decades, but its plans to roll out pure electric vehicles are more modest than those of Ford or GM.
Martin Kaiser of Greenpeace Germany said the absence of the major economies and producers was ""gravely concerning"". The European Union executive proposed to the 27 member states, including Germany, in July that they ban the sale of combustion vehicles from 2035, but the plan has yet to be signed off.
GRID GRIND
A transition to electric vehicles requires billions of dollars of investment in charging infrastructure, and adds to the load on grids already struggling with creaking infrastructure and the transition to renewables such as wind and solar power.
In some places, they could also be more polluting than combustion models. In Poland and Kosovo, for instance, they generate more carbon emissions than petroleum engines because the local grids are so reliant on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, according to the consultancy Radiant Energy Group.
Major U.S. airlines, meanwhile, are joining an effort to speed the development and use of so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to decrease emissions in air transport.
SAF is made from renewable sources such as plants and used cooking oil and can reduce emissions by as much as 80%, but is more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel, and not available in the large quantities required.
Alaska Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s aviation unit Amazon Air are among the companies joining the effort to help drive greater SAF production, price cuts and technological advances.
GREEN SKIES?
On Tuesday, the United States said it was setting a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its aviation sector by 2050, in line with a global pledge to do so by the International Air Transport Association.
IATA's director general, Willie Walsh, said he expected airlines to beat an interim goal of meeting 5.2% of their needs with sustainable fuel by 2030, provided that energy companies increased their output.
Air travel accounts for nearly 3% of global emissions, a figure that researchers say could grow rapidly as demand for flights increases.
Environmental groups have expressed concern that potential emissions cuts from SAF are overstated, and have been pressing for measures to reduce air travel or develop zero-emissions technology for planes, currently a distant prospect.
Nineteen countries including Britain and the United States, meanwhile, said they had agreed to establish half a dozen ""green shipping corridors"" with zero emissions by 2050.
The declaration did not specify how that would be achieved, saying only that it would require partnerships between ports and operators to accelerate the decarbonisation of the sector and its fuel supply. 
About 90% of the world's traded goods travel by sea, and shipping also accounts for about 3% of global emissions.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called the declaration ""a big step forward ... for collective action"". 
He said the United States was urging the International Maritime Organisation to adopt a goal of zero emissions for all international shipping by 2050.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) agreed to purchase nearly 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel created from woody biomass at a Mississippi biorefinery, the companies said on Wednesday.
The aviation industry has thrown its weight behind SAF as a way to make flying more environmentally friendly before less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen airplane options become available from the late 2030s.
Velocys' Bayou Fuels facility is expected to produce fuel that is considered carbon negative, due to its use of biogenetic feedstock, renewable power and carbon capture technology offsetting the emissions from burning the fuel.
The fuels made at the Bayou Fuels facility will be blended with petroleum-based jet fuel to generate more than 750 gallons of negative carbon sustainable aviation fuel that Bayou says will be commercially available as early as 2026.
Velocys said projected revenues could total $3 billion over the course of the offtake agreements.
IAG agreed to purchase 220,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) over 10 years beginning in 2026, as part of its goal of using 10% SAF by 2030. Southwest's purchase of 220 million gallons of SAF will span 15 years.
The SAF will generate tradable credits under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the federal renewable fuel standard. Southwest and IAG will buy at a fixed price that includes projected cost of the credits.
SAF generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels but is more costly to produce without tax credits, particularly as production volumes are currently very low at less than 1% of total jet fuel demand.

The United States is setting a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. aviation sector by 2050, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday.
The White House said in September it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030.

""I think there's definitely a strong tolling of the bell for conglomerates,"" William Blair & Company analyst Nicholas Heymann said.
GE said on Tuesday that it will split into three public companies seeking to simplify its business, pare down debt and breathe life into a battered share price.
The move could embolden the boards of several other multi-industry companies, such as Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Electric Co, Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) Inc and 3M, to move ahead on more aggressive portfolio simplification moves, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said.
3M declined to comment. Roper and Emerson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""The simple reality is that companies are permissioned to conglomerate so long as they promise to de-conglomerate as soon as the prior strategy stops working,"" Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research said.
Davis also pointed out that complete or partial breakups have been successful for companies like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) and Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON).

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Martin Wilkie said GE's proposed split could heap the pressure on rival Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) to become leaner. 
Siemens last year spun-off its turbine business Siemens Energy, a move to help it transform itself to a more focused industrial technology company.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Just Eat Takeaway.com's shares slipped on Wednesday after news that U.S. rival DoorDash is entering the European market, prompting a key shareholder to call for a strategy change at Europe's largest food delivery firm.
Cat Rock, which holds a 6.5% stake in Takeaway, renewed calls for it to sell U.S. arm Grubhub and put the proceeds to work defending its market positions in Europe.
The call comes a day after DoorDash, which is larger than Grubhub in the United States, made a big European move with the 7 billion euro ($8.1 billion) purchase of Finland-based Wolt Enterprises OY.
After experiencing rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, established European food ordering companies such as Takeaway, Deliveroo and Delivery Hero are braced for consolidation and competition with a new generation of quick grocery and delivery companies.
Shares in Amsterdam-based Takeaway, which completed its $7.3 billion acquisition of Grubhub in June, were down 5.1% to 59.84 euros at 1340 GMT and are now 35% lower in the year to date.
CEO Jitse Groen responded to suggestions that DoorDash's move could threaten Takeaway.com in Germany by saying: ""Our business in Germany is bigger than the whole of Wolt worldwide"". 
""Its competitive position is better than Doordash('s) in the US. But if you want to believe in fairy tales then I accept I cannot change your views,"" Groen added on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Cat Rock said in a presentation that Grubhub would be more valuable in the hands of a larger competitor interested in expanding its same-day delivery abilities. 
A sale would also improve the valuation of Takeaway, which has lagged peers over the past year, and allow it to invest more heavily in defending its positions in Europe, Cat Rock added. 
Takeaway responded to criticism from Cat Rock and other investors last month by noting that it has only recently acquired Grubhub and has plans to defend it against competitors such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) . 

A Takeaway spokesperson said it had no further comment ""at this stage"".

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday it is integrating Workplace, the work-focused version of its social app, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s collaboration app Teams, so users can better share information between the two platforms.
The changes will allow users to share content from Workplace's newsfeed and from its groups into Microsoft's Teams platform. Soon, it said, users will be able to livestream video from Teams into Workplace groups. 
Remote-working tools have become key fixtures for companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""You have to meet employees where they directly are, wherever they're doing their work, whatever platforms they're most using,"" said Ujjwal Singh, head of Workplace, in an interview. He said the integration was largely aimed at customers of both products.
Workplace, which the Silicon Valley company uses as its internal messaging board, was launched outside of the company five years ago. Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen recently leaked internal presentations and discussions shared on the service.
The software is also used by companies including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Deliveroo. Facebook says it has 7 million paid subscribers on Workplace.

Microsoft and Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta to signal its refocus on the metaverse, are also both building out virtual reality solutions for remote working.
Microsoft last week announced it would bring its virtual platform Mesh into Microsoft Teams next year. Facebook recently launched a beta test of Horizon Workrooms, a remote work app for users of its VR headsets.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday launched a new subscription service aimed at helping small-business owners manage the Apple devices used by their employees.
Business Essentials, as Apple is calling the service, is similar to management software that companies such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) or VMware (NYSE:VMW) Inc sell to large business for setting up and keeping secure their fleets of phones, laptops and tablets. But Apple's version is simplified for businesses with between 50 and 500 employees that have either a small IT department or none at all. 
The service will cost between $2.99 and $12.99 per month per user depending on how many devices a business wants to manage for each employee and how much cloud storage the business wants. 
For an additional monthly cost, Apple will also offer a service to repair or replace broken hardware at a business within four hours, though the company said it has not yet determined pricing for that service.
""Time is of the essence - for small businesses, it's one of their most valuable resources,"" Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of enterprise and education marketing, told Reuters in an interview. ""As they start to grow, there are more demands on their time. And that can be in lieu of running the business doing the things they need to do.""
Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst at Lopez Research, said the pairing of management software with a repair service subscription is unique in the industry.

""People are going to think that part doesn't matter, but I think they're underestimating the power of being able to get really good service,"" she said.
Apple said it will start testing Business Essentials in the United States on Wednesday, and it will be free until the service is finalized next year. Apple plans to expand it to other locations in the future, executives said.

(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF), still months away from seeking regulatory approval of its experimental Alzheimer's drug, is already taking aim at rival Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Aduhelm, saying that its medication would be priced competitively.
Bill Anderson, head of pharmaceuticals at Roche, did not provide pricing details for the company's treatment for the lethal brain-wasting disease, but indicated in an interview that it could be priced below Aduhelm's $56,000-a-year cost. Anderson said Roche has taken similar action in the past, including for multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus, which was launched at a price 30% below the standard of care.
When it launched in June, Biogen's drug became the first approved medication that targets one of the changes in the brain that occurs with Alzheimer's. But Aduhelm sales have stalled as Medicare, the U.S. government healthcare program for people over age 65, evaluates coverage. 
The delay has opened up opportunities for rivals such as Roche whose drugs are still many months away from U.S. Food and Drug Administration review and their approval is uncertain. 
Anderson said Roche has priced new therapies in the United States ""at or below the prices of things we replace ... even though we had superior results."" 
Roche, Biogen and other drugmakers are due to present data this week at the annual Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference in Boston. 
Roche's Alzheimer's candidate gantenerumab, like Aduhelm, is designed to remove amyloid plaques from the brains of people diagnosed with the disease. Roche has said it will wait for pivotal trial results, due in the second half of 2022, before seeking regulatory review.
Anderson told Reuters that Roche aims to show ""unequivocal data on efficacy."" 
The FDA approved Biogen's drug based on evidence that it reduces amyloid brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's, rather than proof that it slows the disease's progression.
Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) has begun a rolling FDA application for its own experimental Alzheimer's drug based on evidence of its plaque-removing ability. Lilly's drug could get U.S. approval by the second half of next year. 
Medicare expects to issue a final decision in April on its reimbursement policy, which will apply to all plaque-reducing agents.

Biogen posted third-quarter Aduhelm sales of just $300,000, far below the $11 million Wall Street had expected. Some neurology centers using the drug have said the company is providing Aduhelm, given as a monthly infusion, free of charge while the insurance claims process is worked out.

The U.S. airline on Tuesday offered bonuses and higher pay of up to 300% to all employees working during the holidays.
With its latest offer, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was trying to prevent more disruptions after it had to cancel over 2,300 flights earlier this month due to weather and staffing-led disruptions.
U.S. airlines have been scrambling to hire more pilots and flight attendants as they prepare to fly more people after the country opened its borders to vaccinated foreigners.
In a memo to pilots, American Airlines said it was disappointed with the Allied Pilots Association's decision and would continue to work with the union. 
The union said its board unanimously rejected American Airlines' offer, preferring to seek ""meaningful permanent improvements in a new collective bargaining agreement"". 
Pilots would have been eligible for a premium pay of 50% over normal hourly pay for flying on 19 peak days during November and December, American executives Kimball Stone and Chip Long said in the memo.

Pilots could have also picked up double pay for open holiday trips not assigned to a pilot.

(Reuters) - Global automakers are planning to spend more than half a trillion dollars on electric vehicles and batteries through 2030, according to a Reuters analysis, amping up investments aimed at weaning car buyers away from fossil fuels and meeting increasingly tough decarbonization targets.
Less than three years ago, a similar analysis by Reuters found car companies planned to spend $300 billion on EVs and related technologies. But looming zero-carbon mandates in cities such as London and Paris and countries from Norway to China have lent additional urgency to the industry’s EV-related investment commitments.
The most recent analysis shows carmakers planning to spend an estimated $515 billion over the next five to 10 years to develop and build new battery-powered vehicles and shift away from combustion engines. 
Graphic on global EV investments: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ys9BIk
But industry executives and forecasters remain concerned that consumer demand for EVs could fall well short of aggressive targets without substantial additional incentives and even greater spending on charging infrastructure and grid capacity.
Brian Maxim, head of global powertrain forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, likens the growing investment commitments in vehicle electrification to the Cold War: ""Once a few manufacturers announced EV programs, everyone else had to announce their own or be viewed as being left behind.""
However, he added, ""this leaves a lot of vehicle manufacturers planning significant volumes for a vehicle category that has unknown consumer acceptance, and will have minimal to no profit"" for years. 
Reuters compiled the investment data from company statements, investor presentations and regulatory filings.

Other surveys have come up with different spending projections. In June, consulting firm AlixPartners said auto industry investments in electric vehicles would reach $330 billion by 2025. In 2020, all global automakers combined spent nearly $225 billion on capital expenditures and research and development, according to AlixPartners.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, the world's largest EV manufacturer, appears to be the one company that is selling virtually every vehicle it can build and is readying new multibillion-dollar ""gigafactories"" near Berlin and Austin that will significantly boost its annual production capacity. In early November, the company was valued at $1.2 trillion, more than twice the combined value of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
Meanwhile, political and regulatory pressure is building on the world's carmakers to begin phasing out production of fossil-fueled vehicles, including gasoline-electric hybrids, over the next 10-15 years, while ramping up output of full electric models. 
A number of countries, from Singapore to Sweden, have said they will ban sales of new combustion engine vehicles by 2030. U.S. President Joseph Biden has said he wants 40% to 50% of sales to be electric vehicles by 2030.
Germany's VW Group, which is still recovering financially from the 2016 Dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, continues to lead the rest of the industry, with more than $110 billion in EV and battery investment commitments through 2030. Those commitments, which represent more than 20% of the industry total, underpin VW's aggressive rollout plans for millions of EVs in Europe, China and North America over the next decade.
VW's investments, like those of many of its rivals, are aimed at improving the range and performance of batteries and lowering the cost of EVs, as well as expanding battery and EV production across the globe, according to public data released by the companies.
VW and fellow German automakers  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG are planning to spend a combined $185 billion through 2030, while U.S. automakers GM and Ford expect to spend nearly $60 billion through 2025.

Chinese automakers, led by VW and GM local partner SAIC Motor, have announced well over $100 billion in investment targets over the next decade. Japanese automakers lag far behind, with Honda Motor, Toyota Motor and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor so far publicly committing less than $40 billion combined. 
These investments do not include the tens of billions of dollars being invested in additional production capacity by the world's largest battery companies, many in cooperation with their automaker partners.

The combined net sales at the two businesses – Dot's Pretzels Llc, the owner of Dot's Homestyle Pretzels, and Pretzels Inc – were about $275 million for the 12 months ended September, Hershey said in a statement.
Dot's accounted for 55% of the pretzel category's growth in the United States during the past year, it added.
Packaged food makers have been spending billions of dollars to boost their snacking portfolios and keep sales growth levels high, after the COVID-19 pandemic helped them book outsized gains last year from people mainly staying at home.
""(Savory and better-for-you snacks are) two areas where we are underdeveloped, and we have an opportunity to capture incremental snacking occasions,"" Hershey Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said at a conference earlier this year.
Hershey has also been doubling down on the snacking category in recent years, buying SkinnyPop popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands in a $1.6 billion deal in 2018 and making a recent entry into the nutrition bar category.
Dot's Pretzels was created more than a decade ago in North Dakota by founder Dot Henke in her home kitchen, while private investment firm Peak Rock Capital owns the four-decade old Pretzels Inc.
Hershey said it would also add three manufacturing locations and four pretzel-seasoning facilities when the deals close, expected by the end of this year. 

Rival  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in May said it would buy Greece-based snacks maker Chipita S.A., which houses croissant and baked snack brands, including 7Days, Chipicao and Fineti, for about $2 billion.
Hershey, which already makes Reese's Peanut Butter cups and SkinnyPop Popcorn, said the latest deals would add to its adjusted earnings next year.

Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe said the company's push for a larger global footprint would be supported by four assembly plants around the world.
""We better be growing at least that quick; certainly before the end of the decade is how we think about it,"" Scaringe said in an interview ahead of Rivian's market debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.
Irvine, California-based Rivian said it expects to raise almost $12 billion in one of the largest ever initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States. Prior to the IPO, Rivian had raised $10.5 billion since the start of 2019 from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and other investors including T. Rowe Price and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
The IPO follows in the footsteps of several other EV startups that have gone public over the past year through reverse mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Rivian, other startups and established automakers are racing to take on Tesla as pressure grows in regions including China and Europe on automakers to eliminate vehicle emissions.
Rivian has a plant in Normal, Illinois, and has announced plans for a second U.S. factory, as well as eventually plants in Europe and China. It has not provided a location or timeframe for the second U.S. plant.
The Illinois plant currently has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles and Rivian has said it intends to increase that to 200,000 by 2023 as it adds new vehicles.
Rivian is building the R1T pickup truck, and soon will add the R1S SUV as well as an electric commercial van for Amazon.com, which is the company's largest shareholder with a stake of about 20%.  Ford Motor Co  owns a stake in Rivian that is greater than 5%.
Rivian has sold out its R1 lineup into 2023 but Scaringe said those vehicles are just the beginning as it expands its lineup.
""It really serves to open our brand umbrella, under which we can add a whole host of different products, different form factors, different segments, different price points, lower price points, and very much the same way we're doing that with the commercial van space,"" he said, declining to reveal how low in pricing Rivian will move.
The R1T's starting price is $67,500.
VAN PRODUCTION
In addition to the consumer vehicles, Rivian has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon by 2025. Under the deal, Rivian will provide the last-mile vans exclusively to Amazon for four years, with further rights the following two years, but Scaringe emphasized that still leaves opportunity for Rivian in other segments including cargo, mid-mile, commercial van and work van.
Scaringe added the Illinois plant line dedicated to building the Amazon vans was also designed to build other vehicles.

""We've designed the line to have head room above and beyond Amazon's needs,"" he said. ""That's what allows us to go into some of these other spaces within the commercial van space.""
Scaringe also said he does not plan to raise his presence on social media to match that of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose posts on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are heavily followed. Rivian's marketing focus will be customer events and experiences, he said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) posted its slowest revenue growth since it went public in 2004 on Wednesday, hurt by a regulatory crackdown, and said the outlook for the advertising sector would remain weak into next year. 
China's largest company by market value has been hit on multiple fronts by new regulations, including limits https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rolls-out-new-rules-minors-online-gaming-xinhua-2021-08-30 on the amount of time children can spend playing video games. Curbs on other industries such as education have also dampened advertising appetite.
In addition, the Chinese government has not approved any new games since August, raising fears that the industry could see a repeat of 2018 when China suspended approvals of new video game titles over a nine-month period as part of an overhaul of the regulatory bodies that oversee the sector. [nL1N2Q10KB]
Tencent's chief strategy officer, James Mitchell, said he expected the suspension to be temporary and that the company had a large backlog of games ready. He also said he did not expect China's new gaming limits on minors to be extended to adults. 
""We are proactively working with the regulators on implementing all the necessary changes,"" Tencent president Martin Lau told analysts on a call. 
""We expect that once the industry has really complied with the new regulations, have made all the adjustments, even when new regulations come around in the future...as the industry adapts further the impact on the industry will be less over time.""
Tencent's third-quarter revenue climbed 13% to 142.4 billion yuan, slightly below expectations, and was the slowest quarterly growth since the company went public in 2004, Refinitiv data showed.
Net profit rose 3% to 39.5 billion yuan ($6.18 billion), the company said in a statement. This beat analyst expectations who were predicting a decline, according to Refinitiv data.
METAVERSE BUILDING BLOCKS
Beijing's year-long crackdown on its once-freewheeling internet industry has punished well-known companies for engaging in what were previously considered regular market practices, wiping billions of dollars off their market values.
Tencent said its advertising revenue growth rate slowed to 5% in the period as the industry adapted to new regulatory and macroeconomic developments, citing weakness in categories including education, insurance and games. 
It said it expected advertising pricing industry-wide to remain soft for several quarters but said the industry should adjust next year.
Sales from mobile games rose 9%, said the owner of games such as ""Honor of Kings"" and ""PUBG mobile"". Domestic games revenue grew by 5%, while international games revenue rose 20%, boosted by games such as ""Valorant"" and ""Clash of Clans"".
Tencent said minors accounted for 0.7% of domestic games time in September this year, down from 6.4% in September 2020, after the government's new limits came into force at the beginning of that month. 

Asked about Tencent's view on the metaverse, the idea of a shared virtual world that people can access through different devices and where they can move through, Lau said it believed there were ""multiple pathways to get into the metaverse opportunity"".
""In terms of our capabilities and positioning, we feel we have a lot of the technology and know-how building blocks for us to explore and develop for the metaverse opportunity.""

Investing.com — Shares of French vaccine company  Valneva SE ADR  (NASDAQ:VALN) surged 24% Wednesday on news that the European Commission has approved an agreement that will see the company supply up to 60 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine over two years. 
The deal includes approximately 27 million doses in 2022, with the EC having an option to increase its initial purchase to a total of 60 million doses by the end of 2023.
Valneva's Nasdaq-listed shares traded around $50.33 mark following the news.
According to an article from Dr. Amir Khan at Al Jazeera, Valneva's vaccine is different from other Covid-19 vaccines in that it aims to stimulate an immune response to the entire virus, rather than just the spike protein.
""We are deeply committed to bringing an alternative vaccine solution to the market as quickly as possible and continue to work tirelessly to achieve that,"" said Thomas Lingelbach, Valneva's CEO.
""Our Phase 3 results confirmed the advantages often associated with inactivated vaccines and we continue to believe that our differentiated vaccine candidate could make an important contribution to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he added."
954,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 09:43AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Lower, Spooked by Inflation Data; Dow Down 50 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday after data showing the U.S. inflation rate hit its highest in over 30 years, something sure to put fresh pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53 points, or 0.2%, at 36,267 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite - with its heavier weighting of ‘long-duration’ tech stocks that are sensitive to assumptions of future interest rates – was underperforming, down 0.8%.
All three indices had hit record highs in within the last week after the Federal Reserve had indicated at its last policy meeting that it expected not to have to raise interest rates for another year.
The Labor Department said earlier that consumer prices rose 0.9% on the month in October and were up 6.2% on the year - the highest rate in over 30 years. The rise was broad-based, and even the rise in core CPI accelerated to 0.6% on the month, an annual rate of 4.6%. 
""October's core CPI is just a taster; the next few months are going to be horrible,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economst Ian Shepherdson via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""The year-on-year core rate is headed for 6-6.5% over the next three months.""
The bond market's reaction was nonetheless muted: the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose only 2 basis points to 1.49%, still well off its recent highs. 
Among individual movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rebounded 2.8% after falling 12% on Tuesday, a decline that took its market value back below $1 trillion.  The electric vehicle investment universe is set for a major expansion later when Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), the truck-maker backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford (NYSE:F), begins trading. The company, which has never yet sold a vehicle, raised nearly $12 billion and locked in a valuation of some $77 billion in pricing its initial public offering at $78 a share late on Tuesday.  That was comfortably above the top end of a marketing range that had already been raised at the start of the week.
The Rivian IPO process has been a major factor behind the recent rally in Ford stock, which has risen 30% since Rivian's bookrunners started their roadshow and added another 0.9% early Wednesday. The legacy carmaker owns 5% of Rivian.
Elsewhere, Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) stock fell 16%. The Cloud-based AI company's earnings and outlook, released on Tuesday, were above expectations but still provided the trigger for profit-taking after the stock tripled between August and October. Even at Tuesday's close, the stock trades at over 55 times sales. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock also fell 6.7%, likewise hit by profit-taking after results that showed a drop in daily average users despite the recent rally in cryptocurrencies.
Going in the other direction was Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) stock, which leaped 20% on the back of results that reflected the buoyant demand for labor across the economy. That was also evident in jobless claims data earlier that showed initial claims inching down to another post-pandemic low of 267,000."

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -Alphabet unit Google lost an appeal against a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.8-billion) antitrust decision on Wednesday, a major win for Europe's competition chief in the first of three court rulings central to the EU push to regulate big tech.
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager fined the world's most popular internet search engine in 2017 over the use of its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals. 
The shopping case was the first of three decisions that saw Google rack up 8.25 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in the last decade. 
The company could face defeats in appeals against the other two rulings involving its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising service, where the EU has stronger arguments, antitrust specialists say.
The court's support for the Commission in its latest ruling could also strengthen Vestager's hand in her investigations into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The General Court largely dismisses Google's action against the decision of the Commission finding that Google abused its dominant position by favouring its own comparison shopping service over competing comparison shopping services,"" the Court said.
The court said the Commission correctly found Google's practices harmed competition and dismissed the company's argument that the presence of merchant platforms showed there was strong competition.
It backed the Commission's fine, citing the serious nature of the infringement and that ""the conduct in question was adopted intentionally, not negligently"".
Google said it would review the judgment and that it has already complied with the Commission's order to ensure a level playing field for rivals. It did not say if it would appeal to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's top court.
The Commission welcomed the ruling, saying it would provide legal clarity for the market.
""The Commission will continue to use all tools at its disposal to address the role of big digital platforms on which businesses and users depend to, respectively, access end users and access digital services,"" the EU executive said in a statement. 
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS
In other investigations, the EU watchdog is focusing on Google's use of data and its digital advertising business. The company is seeking to settle https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-google-seeking-settle-eu-antitrust-probe-into-adtech-source-2021-09-23 the latter case, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.
Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance and who advises several Google rivals, said Vestager should expand her investigation into other areas.
""Today's judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google in other areas where it is throwing its weight around, like in online advertising, app stores and video streaming,"" he said.
Lawmaker Rasmus Andresen at the European Parliament, which wants to beef up tech rules proposed by Vestager, said Europe needs both antitrust enforcement and legislation to tame U.S. tech giants.
""Only when Big Tech feels economic consequences through penalties and regulation we will see change. In addition to an adjustment of the Digital Markets Act, we call for a tightening of competition law to make it easier to split up platforms that are too dominant,"" he said.
To augment her antitrust powers, Vestager last year proposed new landmark tech rules that will force U.S. tech giants to change their business models to ensure a level playing field for rivals.
Separately, on Tuesday, the UK Supreme Court blocked https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-supreme-court-blocks-43-bln-google-class-action-over-iphone-tracking-2021-11-10 a planned $4.3 billion class action against Google over allegations the internet giant unlawfully tracked the personal information of millions of iPhone users.

COMMENTS:
JOE SALUZZI, CO-FOUNDER, THEMIS TRADING LLC, NEW JERSEY
“The Fed knew this was coming and they're sticking by their guns, saying this is not going to last that long. When you look at stocks, a lot of companies reported saying that they’ll increase prices to offset cost increase and they've actually done well, the earnings season was decent this time. With that said, this can't go on forever. You can't keep right raising the price of milk from $3 to $4 to $5 to $7. Eventually, something's got to give.”“If the rate of change continues to rise, the Fed is going to have to make a move. But, at this point, they're saying no, we're comfortable with these numbers and we expected these numbers and they've hinted it all along too. They'll taper the purchases but they're not raising rates anytime soon, and not until next year.”
STEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO
""A little hot. I think that's to be expected. I think a lot of this is directly related to the fact that we shut down, in some cases more dramatically than in other cases, and as things start to reopen, there's a lot of disorganization in the economy.
    ""How much of this is due to a disorganized economy?... The only way we're going to know is to see what the numbers are a year from today.
    ""I kind of agree with the central bankers. A big part of this inflation is transitory, and it's due to a disorganized economy starting to function again.""
RUSSELL PRICE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES INC, TROY, MICHIGAN
“It’s tough for policymakers to ignore this report because the gains were so broadly distributed. It’s somewhat funny, one of the only things that did go down was alcoholic beverages, so at least consumers can drown their sorrows from higher prices.
“We may start to see some deceleration in food prices in the months ahead because yesterday’s PPI report showed declines at the final and intermediate stage of processing food. 
“It might still be too early to say (if inflation will remain elevated) but, one factor that is likely to continue to contribute, and to contribute in a material way to elevated CPI readings, are housing costs which are related to rental rates. Housing costs are by far the largest percentage component of the CPI index, shelter accounts for just under 33%.”
RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS
“We haven't seen as big of an increase in CPI as we have in PPI, which tells me that corporations have been absorbing a portion of that additional cost themselves which impacts their margins and profitability. But eventually, that has to be passed on if PPI numbers keep rising. So the fact that we've had high PPI numbers gave us some insight into the fact that we were going to get higher CPI, and there's still a lot of room there, which tells me we’ll have higher inflation again next month as well.”
“These numbers have brought the probability of a rate hike in June up a little bit, but it won't bring it any closer than June.”
BEN JEFFERY, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK
“The most meaningful trend I think is the flattening of the curve, as the market is kind of assuming a more aggressive normalization path from the Fed.”
“What we heard from Powell at his press conference last week seems to suggest that for the time being they’re still crediting the upside in inflation to more supply-side issues, and so they are opting to remain patient until some of those supply-side concerns start to work themselves out in the middle of next year.”
“At this point the flatter curve seems to be pointing to more aggressive Fed action, so I think that’s going to be the primary story probably over the next several months or even the next quarter or two.”
JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CRESSET CAPITAL, CHICAGO
“Inflation hawks probably aren’t surprised by this. The inflation came in higher than expected, and bond investors need to be compensated for the purchasing power risk. Already real rates are near record lows. At some point the bond market is going to realize they’ve been a punching bag in this whole market and they’ll demand some kind of compensation.”
RICK MECKLER, PARTNER AT CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS IN NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY
“It’s got to be disconcerting for the bond market to see a CPI number like this...What really is the biggest worry is that the bond market reacts to the point where it does finally become some competition for stocks. And I think we're still a ways away from that. Even though the Fed believes that inflation is transitory, the evidence is starting to add up that that's not true. But my guess is they'll stick with their plan, at least for several more months.”
“The data is a negative for the market, but probably not the type of negative it might have been years ago, as retail investors continue to clamor particularly for technology stocks. The Fed has made very few moves outside of what they've told the markets they plan to do, but I think even they've got to be a little concerned by the strength of the increase.”
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES IN NEW YORK
“What do these numbers say? Simply that inflation is going to be long-lasting and structural inflation has picked up speed. These (year-on-year) numbers the highest, I believe, in about 21 years. 
""The bottom line is that this is going to be a real challenge for the Fed in the coming months and suggests that inflation has not peaked. 
""It's going to lift the eyebrows of the Fed. Inflation will peak probably in the beginning of the second quarter, and over the next several months the Fed will have to change its tune a little bit and accelerate the pace of tapering.”
GREGORY DACO, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK
    ""This report is somewhat concerning in terms of the trend. We had been expecting higher inflation. We had been expecting a bit of a hotter month in October. But this surpassed our expectations. So we're on a firmer trajectory in terms of inflation. And I think things will continue to get worse before they get better in terms of the inflation outlook because we don't see core inflation peaking until sometime in early 2022.""
    ""From the Fed's perspective, it puts additional pressure to consider earlier tightening of its monetary policy. This does not create an immediate force to lead them to tighten, but it does increase the pressure.""
JOSEPH LAVORGNA, AMERICAS CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK
“It’s clear that the rate of inflation and the persistence of elevated inflation are much more than what policymakers and markets had expected. Counterintuitively, the higher inflation goes the more the market believes this will dent real income and in effect slow the economy, which to me is the wrong way of thinking, but that’s how the market is going to approach this. 
""The problem with elevated inflation is the longer you have it, the more likely it becomes ingrained and a the less likely, even with a significant weakening of GDP growth, short of a recession, will change that new dynamic.”
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO

""It is not supply, it is demand. The numbers today, US and globally, are showing that what we have is a demand-driven inflation that can be curtailed with higher interest rates and the Fed is behind the curve. They may now be forced into raising rates sooner rather than later.""
""Interest rates are going up, the yield curve is flattening and so growth stocks are relatively poorer performers while value is doing well with better numbers for some of the commodity stocks, financials, healthcare, industrials, basic materials.""

However, as pandemic data improves and restrictions ease, LYFT should benefit from recovering rideshare demand. But given the stock’s high volatility, is it an ideal addition to one’s portfolio now? Read on.
Multimodal transportation networks-operator Lyft, Inc. (LYFT), which is headquartered in San Francisco, is the second-largest ride-sharing service provider in the United States and offers various transportation options through the company’s mobile-based applications. The company faced several operational disruptions during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic due to reduced demand. However, with rising vaccination rates and easing travel restrictions, rideshare demand is rebounding, which should benefit the company.
LYFT’s shares have soared in price since the company reported better than expected third-quarter earnings and outlined a path to sustained profitability on the back of drastic cost cuts and a return of riders and drivers. The company reported an 11% increase in active riders for the quarter ended September 30, but ridership remained 35% below peak levels registered before the pandemic. LYFT’s revenues increased 73% year-over-year to $864.4 million in its fiscal third quarter, ended September 30. Its adjusted net income was $17.8 million, representing a 106.3% increase versus the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, the company’s EPS surpassed the Street’s EPS estimate by 266.7%. ""We're seeing the right things happening in the market and will begin to taper incentives in the quarter ahead,"" said LYFT President John Zimmer.
However, considering that full-fledged business travel to offices has not yet resumed due to the continuation of remote working, and that many consumers are reluctant to travel with unvaccinated children, it could take a while before the company operates at its pre-pandemic capacity.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German sportswear company Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) warned on Wednesday of a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) hit to sales from factory closures in COVID-hit Vietnam and supply chain bottlenecks that it expects to affect business into next year. 
Shares in the company fell more than 5% as it became the latest multinational to report manufacturing disruptions and shipping delays as the global economy rebounds from the worst effects of the pandemic. 
Factory closures in Vietnam from July to September and a gradual re-opening since October meant Adidas had lost capacity for 100 million items in the second half of 2021, finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer told journalists.
That was exacerbated by delays to container shipping at both origin and destination ports, with a third of shipments leaving Asia with significant delays, Ohlmeyer added.
The lost capacity will wipe 1 billion euros off total sales across the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 even after mitigation actions, with the sourcing network set to be mostly back to normal by the end of this year, Adidas said.
Rival Puma has also warned supply bottlenecks would mean a shortage of its products in 2022. 
Vietnam usually accounts for 28% of Adidas sourcing and its factories mostly make shoes for the company.
Adidas managed to shift production to China and Indonesia for 30 million units, Ohlmeyer said, and is redeploying stock from markets in Asia currently hit by lockdowns, as well as using more air freight to get products to customers on time.
The company also plans to cut the number of products it offers at a discount and increase prices by around 5% going into 2022.
Adidas expects ""flattish"" sales in the fourth quarter, meaning about 17-18% sales growth for the full year, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said. The company expects sales growth of at least 8-10% for 2022, Ohlmeyer said.
Third-quarter sales rose a currency-neutral 3% to 5.752 billion euros while operating profit fell 8.5% to 672 million euros, missing analysts' average forecast.
Sales fell 15% in Greater China owing to renewed pandemic restrictions as well as the ongoing fallout from a consumer boycott that Adidas has faced in the country since March.
Western brands have come under fire in China for saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Beijing denies any abuses.

Adidas has launched an action plan to try to revive its fortunes in China, long its most important growth market. It has set up a dedicated studio to generate faster marketing and is increasing its creation of products just for the Chinese market.

(Reuters) - Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has sold some Roblox stock, cashing in on its 42% jump on Tuesday following the gaming company's strong quarterly results.
The asset manager said it had offloaded 82,267 Roblox shares - worth about $9 million based on the stock's Tuesday closing price - from its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF portfolio.
The surge helped the company more than double its stock price to $109.52 since its market debut in March, while adding $18.7 billion to its market capitalization. 
Shares of Roblox, which describes itself as a metaverse company, slipped about 4% in premarket trading on Wednesday.
Founded in 2004, the company has worked for a decade to build a virtual platform - or the new buzzword in the tech world called metaverse - where its users can interact and play games.
That is expected to help Roblox at a time when other video game companies like  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive, along with social media companies, are scrambling to build a metaverse around their products to keep users engaged.
Roblox has attracted several well-known names including Gucci, Vans and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which are looking to take an early position in the metaverse and attract next-generation consumers, said Rupantar Guha, analytics firm GlobalData's gaming analyst.

""Growing brand involvement will expand Roblox's user base from children to adults, delivering further growth as the metaverse evolves.""
Roblox, known for its popular games ""MeepCity"" and ""Adopt Me!"", reported a 28% surge in third-quarter bookings to $637.8 million on Monday after market close. The company got a boost during the pandemic when millions of pre-teens turned to video games for entertainment.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>","Wendy's profit view squeezed by rising commodity costs, labor crunch","(Reuters) -Wendy's Co on Wednesday projected annual profit below market estimates as a widespread labor shortage and rising costs of raw materials eat into the fast-food chain's margins, sending its shares down 4% in premarket trading. 
The company said it expected annual adjusted earnings between 79 cents and 80 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 82 cents, according to Refinitiv.
A worker crunch in the United States has made it difficult for restaurants to ensure adequate staffing, forcing some to hike wages and others like Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) to cut store hours. 
The industry has also reeled under a surge in prices of raw materials from chicken to edible oils and higher freight costs. 
Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) company-operated restaurant margin, a key measure of profitability, declined to 14.4% in the third quarter from 16.9% a year earlier. 
Its U.S.-same store growth of 2.1% also fell short of expectations of 4.4% as rivals McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands launched new menu items and collaborated with celebrities to lure more customers.
But the Dublin, Ohio-based restaurant chain reported a 14.7% jump in same-store sales at its international restaurants, trouncing estimates of a 9.1% rise. 

Wendy's also increased its share buyback plan to $300 million, as part of which it would launch a $125 million share repurchase program in the current quarter.
Total revenue rose 4% to $470.3 million in the three months to Oct. 3. Wendy's earned 19 cents per share on an adjusted basis, edging past estimates of 18 cents.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google lost an appeal against a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.8-billion) European antitrust decision on Wednesday, a major win for the bloc's competition chief Margrethe Vestager in the first of three court rulings that will strengthen the EU's push to regulate big tech.
Following are comments from complainants and lawyers on the General Court ruling: 
SHIVAUN RAFF, CEO OF UK PRICE COMPARISON SITE FOUNDEM WHOSE COMPLAINT TRIGGERED EU SHOPPING CASE
""The importance of ending Google's ability to manipulate this unprecedented power to its own anti-competitive ends cannot be overstated.
Today's judgment provides the Commission with a firm basis to now enforce its June 2017 Prohibition Decision—not just for the beleaguered comparison shopping market directly addressed by the Decision, but also for the travel, local, jobs and other vertical search markets for which this Decision sets a precedent.""
RICHARD STABLES, CEO OF KELKOO GROUP AND GOOGLE CRITIC
""The real work starts now to fix the ineffective remedy that failed to restore competition and choice to the market – and which may ultimately undermine the efforts to regulate Big Tech in Europe.""
MARKUS FERBER, EU LAWMAKER
""This verdict sends a clear signal that even Big Tech companies cannot do as they please in digital markets. Rules are rules, even for Google.
However, the case still highlights some of the shortcomings of EU competition law. Since the case started in 2014, many of Google's competitors have vanished from the market. Going forward, we need a legal basis that is watertight and allows for much swifter action to fight the abuses by Big Tech.""
MONIQUE GOYENS, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF EUROPEAN CONSUMER GROUP BEUC
""Today's General Court ruling makes clear that Google must give equal opportunities to all market players to compete on the basis of their own merit and gain consumers' trust on an equal footing. In light of the ruling, we ask the European Commission to ensure that Google does not abuse its dominance as a search engine by giving its own services preference in other areas.""
THOMAS VINJE, PARTNER AT LAW FIRM CLIFFORD CHANCE AND ADVISER TO GOOGLE RIVALS
""Google got whacked with this judgment and it is reverberating all the way to its Mountain View headquarters.
If Google is smart, it will take a page out of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s playbook after its 2007 General Court failure, cut its losses, forego an appeal and move on.  It did Microsoft a world of good.
Today's judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google in other areas where it is throwing its weight around, like in online advertising, app stores and video streaming.""
LUTHER LOWE, YELP SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PUBLIC POLICY
""The European Commission must now take this favorable precedent and prosecute Google for its parallel abuses in the local search market and allow services like  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) to compete on the merits.
But history's verdict on this period will be based on whether this odyssey ultimately produced a tangible impact for European consumers, which is why it is vital that these tools be utilized in markets where competition remains salvageable."" 
JONAS KOPONEN, PARTNER AT LINKLATERS 
""It (the judgment) is significant in itself, but to antitrust enforcement in the tech sector generally, and also to new regulation that is being proposed for platforms in Europe and elsewhere.""
RASMUS ANDRESEN, EU LAWMAKER
""This case shows once again that EU laws are not sufficient. We can no longer lose ourselves in years of court cases when the abuse of market power is obvious. That's why it's important that we now quickly conclude the legislative process on the Digital Markets Act and that the law can enter into force.

Only when Big Tech feel economic consequences through penalties and regulation we will see change.
In addition to an adjustment of the Digital Markets Act, we call for a tightening of competition law to make it easier to split up platforms that are too dominant.""

964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:18AM ET</span>",Rivian IPO Looms Large as Tesla Ignites Bubble Talk: Tech Watch,"(Bloomberg) --  Rivian Automotive  Inc. makes its stock-market debut Wednesday just as investors grow increasingly concerned about extreme rallies in electric-vehicle stocks, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s selloff this week adding to fears of a bubble.
Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), a maker of electric pickup trucks, raised $11.9 billion in the biggest initial public offering of the year. At $76.4 billion, Rivian’s eye-popping market value is higher than EV producers Lucid Group Inc. and Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc. 
Those companies have been at the heart of some of the biggest stock-market moves recently as investors bet that the shift away from internal combustion engines will produce huge revenues. For now, though, the companies, Tesla aside, are unprofitable. Rivian lost almost $1 billion in the first half and Nikola Corp., Lordstown Motors Corp. (NASDAQ:RIDE) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) don’t even have sales yet.  
“Everyone wants to invest in a good business in a space that is going to grow,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading Institutional Services. “But it is incredibly dangerous to overpay, especially in a bubble for that growth.”
A slew of deals and policy changes have extended the bubble-like rally beyond carmaking stocks. 
 Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc. surged in the past month after the car-rental companies embraced the adoption of EVs. Laser-based radar maker Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) rallied as much as 37% Tuesday on a deal with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. for self-driving hardware. And EV charging stocks such as Volta Inc (NYSE:VLTA) jumped after Congress passed the biggest U.S. infrastructure package in decades.
The thing is, while these popular stocks often skyrocket, they can just as easily come tumbling down fast. Tesla, for example, plunged 12% Tuesday after a string of negative news -- including a Twitter poll by Chief Executive Elon Musk about a possible stock sale and a report of a tweet from investor Michael Burry that said Musk may want to sell some shares to cover his personal debts. It suffered its biggest two-day slump since September 2020, erasing roughly $200 billion in market value.
The valuations across the industry imply the companies will enjoy massive growth. EV leader Tesla trades at about 14.4 times 2022 sales, much higher than the S&P 500’s 2.85 times. Meanwhile, Nikola trades at a whopping 38.5 times estimated 2022 sales, while Workhorse is valued at 11.1 times estimated revenue. 
The air has already come out of some of the stocks, with Nikola and Lordstown both collapsing 82% from their 2020 peaks. Lordstown has been under investigations by regulators after an internal probe concluded that prior management made inaccurate statements about pre-orders for its planned Endurance pickup, while Nikola’s founder has been hit with criminal fraud charges alleging he defrauded investors. He’s pleaded not guilty.
Still, not everyone’s skeptical. “I wouldn’t count out the space,” Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X Management Co., said in an interview. “When people have tried to bet against that, they’ve for the most part been wrong.”
Indeed,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Inc.-backed Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc. soared 40% on its debut last year and is now trading almost three times its IPO price. But that has of course with some extreme swings -- perhaps the nature of the crowded EV space, as very few companies are even producing cars yet. Rivian is one of them, delivering its first vehicles, mostly to its own employees, a couple of months ago.
And there seems to be plenty of investor demand for Rivian stock. The shares priced at $78 each in the IPO, well above the range of $57 to $62 at which they were initially marketed.
“We were surprised at the valuation of Rivian given its relatively early stage of development,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office.

The deal will help DoorDash enter 22 new markets, including Germany, Denmark and Sweden, while potentially serving about 700 million customers.
""(The move) jump starts international expansion,"" BTIG analyst Jake Fuller said, adding that if it were not for the acquisition, it would have taken DoorDash much longer to reach international markets through ""an organic build-out.""
At least eight brokerages cheered the deal by raising their price targets on the stock. Evercore analysts said a challenge for DoorDash prior to the deal was its lack of international presence.
The takeover is expected to help DoorDash maintain its growth momentum seen during the pandemic. Analysts are estimating a 65% surge in revenue this year, according to Refinitiv data.
""This partnership is really about acceleration and expansion, to play for a bigger prize on an even larger global stage,"" DoorDash Chief Executive Officer Tony Xu said on a conference call on Tuesday. 
Through the all-stock deal, Wolt - which made its first delivery in Helsinki, Finland in 2015 - would be valued at about three times its expected gross order value of $2.5 billion 

""(The deal) speaks volumes that DoorDash would rather buy a sector challenger for more than its own trading multiple than to acquire incumbents at one-third of the valuation,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said.
DoorDash shares, which have nearly doubled since their initial public offering in December, were trading at $223.50 before the bell.

The eighth such deal by the European Union's executive body in the fight against rising infections is a welcome boost for Valneva as it negotiates what has been a bumpy road for its COVID-19 vaccine.
""The Valneva vaccine adds another option to our broad portfolio, once it is proven to be safe and effective by the European Medicines Agency (EMA),"" EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said. ""The message remains the same: trust the science, and vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate.""
Delivery of the VLA2001 inactivated vaccine is expected to begin in April 2022, subject to EMA approval, Valneva said.
The company hopes its candidate, which uses more traditional technology than the mRNA vaccines, could be a more reassuring option for Europeans still reluctant to be immunised.
Valneva last month said that it demonstrated efficacy ""at least as good, if not better"" than AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s shot in a late-stage trial comparing the two, with significantly fewer adverse side effects.
The European Commission said the contract with Valneva provides the possibility for EU member states to purchase nearly 27 million doses in 2022.
Member states can then make a further order of up to 33 million additional vaccines in 2023.
The deal includes the possibility to adapt the vaccine to new variant strains. 
""We are grateful to the European Commission for its support and are eager to help address the ongoing pandemic,"" Valneva Chief Executive Thomas Lingelbach said in a statement. 

The deal will be a relief for Valneva after the European Commission said in April that conditions to conclude a deal had not been met. Then, in September, Britain scrapped a contract for about 100 million doses of the vaccine over concerns that it might not receive approval.
Though Valneva shares have taken several hits along the way, they are up by 175% since the start of the year.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",How GE's Larry Culp split the empire Jack Welch built,"By Anirban Sen and Rajesh Kumar Singh
(Reuters) -It was the break-up that eluded a generation of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co insiders.
When Larry Culp, the first GE chief executive not to rise from within its ranks, convened a board meeting earlier this month to greenlight the split of the industrial conglomerate into three companies, he secured its backing.
It was a far cry from board meetings held in the 1980s and 1990s by one of Culp's predecessors, Jack Welch. The iconic entrepreneur got the GE board to back his moves in the opposite direction, getting GE into businesses as diverse as mortgages, credit cards and television entertainment and prompting the Federal Reserve to characterize the company as too big to fail.
Welch's successors, Jeff Immelt and John Flannery, gradually sold of many of GE's businesses to boost the company's ailing share price in the two decades that followed.
But it was Culp who managed to push through the ultimate untangling of GE, with a plan to break it up into three companies to house its healthcare, aviation and power businesses separately. 
Culp, 58, became GE's CEO in October 2018 after joining it as a board director six months earlier. Culp started informally discussing the idea of a break-up with advisors earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the matter, but discussions with GE's board started to formally intensify in the spring as the plan he put together took shape.
""With the progress on the deleveraging, the progress with our operational transformation, the pandemic lifting ... there's no reason to wait a day,"" Culp told Reuters in an interview. ""It's the right thing to do.""
The idea to spin off healthcare was not new - Flannery had floated it publicly in 2018, but never got to see it through. Financial woes at GE's power business escalated into a crisis that caused the company to miss many profit targets and cost Flannery his job.
In the weeks that followed his appointment, Culp, a former CEO of industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR), undertook a top-to-bottom review of GE's sprawling businesses and numerous profit-and-loss lines, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts and investors lauded him for improving GE's profitability.
Culp decided at the time that the healthcare business, a pre-eminent supplier of medical equipment and instrumentation, was too important of a cash cow, while GE's other two businesses were still not self-sufficient for the break-up to happen, one of the sources said. 
A GE spokeswoman declined to comment on the discussions between Culp and GE's board. 
READY FOR BREAK-UP
Still, Culp wanted to pursue the idea, and pruned GE through other deals in the mean time. These included a $30 billion merger of GE's jet-leasing unit with Ireland's AerCap, and the $21-billion sale of the biopharma business to Danaher. 
Now, GE's troubled power business is finally turning a profit. The company's renewable energy business has also been able to improve its cost structure and be in a position to capitalize on the transition to a low-carbon economy.
""We can spin healthcare, we can do that first. That business is clearly performing well. We have some preparations on the shelf from the (abandoned) IPO a few years ago,"" Culp told Reuters.
""We've talked about some of the work we still need to do in renewables ... but we'll really be ready for this next step in early 2024.""
Hedge fund Trian Fund Management, an ally of Culp on GE's board, lauded the latest moves, stating it ""enthusiastically supports this important step in the transformation of GE.""
To be sure, Culp's tenure at GE has not been without criticism. 
Earlier this year, GE shareholders rejected a payout for Culp of as much as $230 million in a non-binding vote.

Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis, which opposed the pay packages, argued that GE had lowered the bar on Culp's performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic and that his stock award was too generous.
GE countered that the payout was necessary to incentivise Culp.

Shares of the electric-vehicle company have plunged nearly 17% since Thursday’s close, including their worst two days of selling since September 2020 as investor sentiment soured amid a wave of negative headlines. 
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sparked this week’s selloff after asking his Twitter followers over the weekend if he should sell 10% of his stake in the firm.
Tesla was trading down 1.5% at $1,009 as of 7:24 a.m. in New York. Futures contracts on the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq 100 were 0.3% and 0.5% lower, respectively, Wednesday as investors await key inflation data.
The rapid drop in value comes just over two weeks after Tesla became one of only five publicly traded U.S. companies to have a valuation north of $1 trillion. Still, despite the recent pressure, the stock has returned about 143% over the last year, making it one of the S&P 500 Index’s best performing members during that span.

Abdul Latif Jameel, a Jeddah-based group named after its founder and today run by his sons, holds almost 114 million shares in Rivian acquired through $303 million of loans made to the U.S. company, according to the sale prospectus. Shares of Rivian are due to start trading in New York Wednesday at $78 each, valuing the company at about $76.4 billion on a fully diluted basis.
Read: EV Maker Rivian Raises $11.9 Billion in Year’s Biggest IPO
The stake puts Abdul Atif Jameel alongside the biggest backers of Irvine, California-based Rivian, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Ford Motor Co  (NYSE:F). The Saudi company, founded in 1945 as a small trading business, is now better known in its home market as the distributor for  Toyota  Motor Corp.'s (NYSE:TM) vehicles.
Abdul Latif Jameel’s investment unit acquired warrants for Rivian stock in 2018. It was the first investment by the Saudi company, according to Rivian’s IPO filings, though an article in the magazine of management consultant McKinsey & Co. published in 2020 said it had first invested eight years earlier.
Electric vehicle stocks have soared this year amid rising concern about climate change, improving battery technology and higher fuel costs. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have jumped 45%.
Abdul Latif Jameel isn’t the only Saudi investor to benefit from an early investment in an electric-vehicle manufacturer. The kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund put $1 billion into Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) in 2018, followed by a further $600 million this year as the firm went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.
Tuesday’s offering raised about $11.9 billion for Rivian, making it the biggest IPO this year. The truckmaker earlier marketed 135 million shares at $72 to $74 after elevating that range from $57 to $62, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) on Wednesday beat forecasts for first-half profit and upgraded its earnings outlook for the second time this year, sending its stock soaring on bets that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise.
Shares in M&S jumped as much as 21% after the retailer said it expected full-year profit before tax and adjusting items to be about 500 million pounds ($677 million) compared to previous guidance of over 350 million pounds.
However, it cautioned that cost pressures will become progressively steeper and said the reintroduction of dividend payments in the current year remained unlikely.
""Given the history of M&S we've been clear that we won't overclaim our progress,"" Chief Executive Steve Rowe said.
""But ... it is clear that underlying performance is improving, with our main businesses making important gains in market share and customer perception. The hard yards of driving long term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance.""
Rowe and chairman Archie Norman are overseeing a restructuring of the 137-year-old group which is focused on improving the quality and value of its clothing and food products, an overhaul of its store estate and investing in technology and e-commerce, including a venture with online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO).
The profit upgrade, only the second in at least two decades after one in August, is the strongest sign yet that the latest turnaround effort is starting to bear fruit after years of false dawns.
The company made a profit before tax and adjusting items of just 41.6 million pounds in the 2020-21 year.
The overhaul is happening in conjunction with supply chain disruptions that are causing price headaches for companies as the global economy reopens from pandemic restrictions and Rowe warned there remained a ""substantive to do list.""
British retailers are grappling with delays in their international supply chains that are compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks.
Last week rival Next warned that stock availability remained ""challenging"". 
M&S made profit before tax and adjusting items of 269.4 million pounds in the six months to Oct. 2, ahead of analyst forecasts of 205-264 million pounds. It made a loss of 17.4 million pounds in the same period last year.
M&S said trading for the first four weeks of its second half has been consistent with growth rates reported in the second quarter and ahead of management expectations. It said it expected the strong demand to be sustained in the near term.
First half food sales increased 10.4% on 2019, before the pandemic impacted trading, while clothing and home revenue was down 1%, with full price sales up 17.3%.
Clothing and home online sales grew 60.8%, representing 34.4% of total sales.
M&S cut its net debt to 3.15 billion pounds.
The stock was up 11.3% at 1105 GMT, extending 2021 gains to 59%.

""Credit is due to the management team for turning around something that was heading toward being uninvestable to being a potentially attractive recovery story,"" said John Moore, investment manager at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).

BERLIN (Reuters) -Volkswagen's Herbert Diess said on Wednesday he was confident he would remain as chief executive into next year, dismissing speculation that he could be pushed aside.
Diess, who is facing disagreements with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s works council over potential cuts, was asked at an online summit organised by German newspaper Handelsblatt whether he believed he would keep his post to which he replied: ""Yes, certainly"". 
The CEO's relationship with the powerful labour council has been strained over how radical an overhaul Europe's top carmaker needs to achieve electric vehicle dominance.
Diess is due to meet later with works council head Daniela Cavallo, who last week heavily criticised his leadership and implementation of the company's strategy.
He reiterated his confidence in Volkswagen's strategy and business plan, stating it was ""equally competitive in the new world as in the old world"". 
GRIDLOCKED?
Diess also dismissed a pledge by carmakers https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/six-major-carmakers-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2040-uk-says-2021-11-10 including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) at COP26 https://www.reuters.com/business/cop to work towards phasing out internal combustion engine cars by 2040.
""It could still make sense to use synthetic fuel cars in Latin America in 2035,"" he said. 
Greenpeace Germany filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen on Monday for rejecting a proposal to end production of internal combustion cars by 2030 and cut emissions by 65% before then.
Diess told Handelsblatt that such a phase-out was ""not doable"", adding: ""We need raw materials, new mines, a circular economy. Battery capacity and building renewable energy grids across Europe will be the bottleneck"".

Volkswagen has so far committed to producing exclusively electric vehicles in Europe from 2035, and having a CO2-neutral fleet globally by 2050.
Current global chip shortages were affecting production of electric vehicles more than for ICE (NYSE:ICE) ones, Diess said.

At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 95 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 85 points, or 0.5%.
The three major indices closed lower Tuesday, snapping long winning streaks, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping just over 100 points, or 0.3%, the broad-based S&P 500 falling 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite losing 0.6%.
Strong earnings, the ongoing business reopening and monetary policy support have lifted indexes to all-time peaks, but continued high inflation has brought the last of those factors into question.
The Federal Reserve began tapering its bond-buying program at its last meeting, and now the main source of concern in the markets is when the central bank starts hiking interest rates. 
The October consumer price index reading is due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and is expected to show a year-over-year gain of 5.8%, which would be the most in 30 years, while the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to have climbed 4.3% from a year ago.
Weekly jobless claims are also due out Wednesday, a day earlier than usual due to Thursday’s Veterans Day holiday.
The likes of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) and  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) are all scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday, while Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) will be in the spotlight after the cryptocurrency exchange missed revenue expectations with lower monthly active transaction users after the close Tuesday.
DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) will also be in focus after the food delivery company announced the acquisition of Finnish delivery app Wolt for around $8 billion. 
Crude prices edged lower Wednesday, retreating after the previous session’s strong gains on the back of industry data showing a surprise 2.5 million barrel reduction in U.S. crude stockpiles, reinforcing the view that supply will remain constrained as demand continues to improve.
A build of about 1.9 million barrels had been expected. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's data are due later at 10:30 AM ET. 
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $83.69 a barrel, having gained 2.7% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $84.61, adding to the previous session’s 1.6% gain. Both contracts closed at their highest levels since Oct. 27.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,826.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1549.

Investing.com -- Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) shares are rallying this morning on Q3 numbers that outpaced analyst expectations and FVRR guidance, and suggested the post-pandemic hangover fears hanging over the company were not fully justified.
Fiverr reported Q3 revenue of $74.3M, 42% growth from last year and ahead of guidance of $72M and analyst estimates of $71M. Earnings also came in ahead of expectations, with non-GAAP net income of $.19/share vs. expectations of $.02 share. GAAP net loss was $.39 per diluted share. The company posted Adjusted EBITDA of $7.3M.
Active buyers rose 33% year over year while spend per buyer rose 20% and Fiverr’s take rate rose to 28.4%, up from 27%. 
The company’s guidance for Q4 is for 33-39% revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA of $5.5-7M, and  they raised their annual revenue guidance by $10M at the midpoint of their range, though it is still below guidance levels earlier in the year.
Ofer Katz, Fiverr’s President and CFO, said, “Fiverr continues to deliver strong financial results amidst the still uncertain backdrop of the pandemic.”
Fiverr had sold off after their Q2 report where the company cited global reopening as a reason for a muted financial outlook. While shares are up 15% pre-market, they are still down 45% from 52-week highs."

LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Supreme Court has blocked a planned 3.2 billion pound ($4.3 billion) British class action against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) over allegations the internet giant unlawfully tracked the personal information of millions of iPhone users. Britain's top judges unanimously granted a Google appeal against the country's first such data privacy case on Wednesday, a move that upsets a string of similar claims waiting in the wings against companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and TikTok.
The landmark case led by Richard Lloyd, a consumer rights activist and the former director of Which? magazine, sought to extend Britain's class action regime to include compensation claims for alleged misuse of data - even if there is no obvious financial loss or distress.
Lloyd, backed by a commercial litigation funder, alleged Google secretly took more than 5 million Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone users' personal data between 2011 and 2012 by bypassing default privacy settings on Safari browsers to track internet browsing histories, and used this for commercial purposes.
""We are bitterly disappointed that the Supreme Court has failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other Big Tech firms who break the law,"" he said.
His lawyer, James Oldnall from law firm Milberg, called it a ""dark day when corporate greed is valued over our right to privacy"".
Google said it had focused for years on products and infrastructure that respect and protect people's privacy, and that the claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and had been addressed at the time.
British business also welcomed the ruling. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said allowing such a case could have put a chill on investment and impacted firms across the economy.
""The Supreme Court has recognised that the 'loss of control' of an individual's personal data is not, in and of itself, sufficient to found a collective action for compensation,"" said Kate Scott, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance. 
""Data litigation will undoubtedly continue, but with a focus on claims where actual damage has been suffered - which is the right outcome for all businesses, and not just big Tech like Google.""
Under a U.S.-style representative or class action, a group of people affected by the same issue are represented by a single person and are automatically part of a lawsuit, without individually signing up, unless they opt out.
Proponents of such lawsuits say they allow access to justice for those with small individual claims or without sufficient financial resources to take on often large, powerful companies.

Critics say such lawsuits fuel claims without merit, driven by opportunistic commercial litigation funders and law firms.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",Shares in Sorrell's S4 slump on future investment plans,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell's S4 Capital said it would invest in new hires and technology to take advantage of a booming digital ad market, hitting its shares despite continued strong underlying profit growth. 
Built by Sorrell, the founder of the world's biggest advertising company WPP (LON:WPP), the purely digital S4 has grown rapidly since its launch three years ago, acquiring businesses to combine consumer data with digital content and serve the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Burberry and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The company reported third-quarter like-for-like gross profit up over 42%, and said that would keep it comfortably on track to surpass its full-year target of 40%. 
But investors focused on the comment that a proportion of its core earnings margin would be invested in growth to take advantage of the changing market dynamic, where the pandemic has forced companies to accelerate their digital adoption. 
Its shares were down 10% as investors had also got used to the company upgrading its profit forecast every time it reports. 
The world's biggest advertising companies have been in the vanguard of the global corporate recovery from the coronavirus crisis, helping companies to spend on new brand campaigns, digital advertising and e-commerce platforms to tap renewed consumer spending. 
By producing digital advertising only, S4 is also in the fastest-growing segment of the market. 
Sorrell told Reuters that the company, having grown to 7,000 staff in 33 countries, needed to invest further in talent and software to support big clients, and to move into new areas such as connected televisions. 
""We've tempered the guidance on EBITDA but it will still be strong, I think most analysts are at around 18 to 19% for the year,"" he said, adding that inflation tended to force companies like consumer goods groups to spend on advertising to justify higher prices. 

Analysts at Peel Hunt said they had reduced their margin expectation, leading to a 10% earnings per share downgrade for the 2021 financial year. However, they said the investment in talent would help the group in the future.

Investing.com -- Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) shares plunged nearly 20% in pre-market trading after the AI-powered loan company posted strong revenue and net income growth, but offered guidance that was less than what the market was looking for.
The company reported revenue of $228M, 250% growth from a year ago and well ahead of analyst estimates for $214M; GAAP EPS came in at $.30/share, and non-GAAP was $.60/share, again well ahead of estimates of $.33/share.
Guidance was also ahead of expectations, with a revenue outlook of $255-$265M vs. a current forecast of $227.6M for Q4, and an adjusted earnings outlook of $.51/share vs. $.20/share expectations.
For all that, the stock has traded much lower in the initial reaction. Adjusted EBITDA guidance is for $51-$53M, below this quarter’s $59.1M mark, which along with the lower adjusted earnings outlook may be part of the issue, especially as Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for Upstart around holiday demand.
It may also be market gravity, as Upstart has become a favorite of both growth and momentum investors. Shares were up nearly 200% from this summer’s lows and, even at the pre-market levels, are up 1170% from last year’s IPO price. Upstart trades at 30x P/S using the high end of their 2021 guidance.
“Since Upstart's IPO a year ago, we've more than tripled our revenue, tripled our profits, tripled the number of banks and credit unions on our platform, and tripled the number of auto dealerships we serve,” said Dave Girouard, co-founder and CEO of Upstart. ""With that many 3s, Upstart is becoming the Steph Curry of the FinTech industry.""
Analysts have yet to weigh in en masse, though Bank of America maintained an underperform rating and dropped the price target to $255/share in the immediate aftermath. Shares are trading around $253 pre-market, more than 19% off of yesterday's close."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - None of Malaysia's major mobile carriers have agreed to use the government's 5G network yet due to transparency and pricing issues, ahead of a rollout planned for next month, a state agency and industry executives said.
However, state-owned network wholesaler Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) told Reuters it still hoped to launch 5G services in three urban centres, as talks continue with mobile operators. 
The Southeast Asian country, a regional laggard in 5G rollout, unveiled a plan for a single shared network in February, hoping it would help accelerate nationwide infrastructure buildup. Similar state-led approaches have been tested in some other markets including Mexico, but largely stumbled.
The lack of industry support for the Malaysian initiative underscores corporate concerns over state meddling and transparency in a country still reeling from a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). 
Malaysia has been losing foreign investor confidence recently amid political instability, with the third administration in as many years coming into power in August. The 1MDB scandal also tainted its reputation and implicated a former prime minister. 
DNB confirmed that no agreement with carriers has been reached and acknowledged its initial timeline for negotiations had been ""too optimistic"". 
The agency will now seek to have formal long-term agreements early next year and continues talks to deploy 5G services in three central areas, including the capital Kuala Lumpur, next month.
""The target now is to have a live network, covering... a total of 500 sites by the end of December, with at least some operators on board to provide a 5G network to end-users,"" Chief Technology Officer Ken Tan said. DNB did not say what would happen if no operators agreed to be part of the deployment.
Carriers, which had already invested in infrastructure upgrades to support 5G services, are concerned the 5G network plan would result in a nationalised monopoly, hurting their business and limiting their access to future technology, said seven current and former industry sources.
They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Three sources estimated the government plan could destroy up to 45 billion ringgit ($10.8 billion) in market value across all mobile operators including Axiata Group, DiGi.com and Maxis.
The sources did not specify over what period the losses would be incurred.
""By 2030, the majority of the network will be on 5G, then there are enforced limitations on our existing (non-5G network) assets,"" one of the sources said. 
""Valuations (of our business) will go down over time and it will go back and hurt our shareholders.""
Under the plan, DNB would hold all 5G spectrum rights as well as build and maintain the entire network, with operators using the infrastructure to provide mobile services.
Axiata and DiGi declined to comment. 
Maxis said in a statement that it has long been ready to roll out 5G in the country. 
""We will continue to focus on our purpose to serve the people and enterprises of Malaysia, and playing a key role to support the digital ambitions of the nation,"" it said.
STABLE SHARE PRICES
The company sources said under the proposed pricing plan, the telcos could end up paying more than they would have if they rolled out 5G on their own. The plan did not take into account additional requirements related to traffic volumes and contingency costs, among other issues, they said. 
According to internal documents reviewed by Reuters, the carriers have asked for ""extensive revisions"" to DNB's pricing proposal, saying it did not demonstrate the cost efficiencies promised. 
""The price is a function of how much assurance we can get on quality of the network,"" a source said. 
The sources said the companies had also sought assurances that DNB would operate solely as a wholesale provider and would not reserve 5G capacity for itself or harbour any retail ambitions.
The concerns highlight investor worries about the Malaysian government's influence in corporate issues, with most large cap public companies in the country counting state-linked investment firms as top shareholders.
DNB said share prices of leading telcos have been stable since the plan's announcement eight months ago.
It also said a fast rollout would lead to an increase in data traffic that would boost operator revenues, while the wholesale plan will help carriers save billions of dollars of investment.
DNB Chief Operating Officer Dushyan Vaithiyanathan said the plan would likely cost only around 16.5 billion ringgit, around half the 30-35 billion ringgit carriers would have needed to spend to build the 5G network themselves.
""The government isn't trying to take away (telcos') rice bowl... We want to deliver the highest quality of services at the lowest price, so that it gives us more certainty in terms of recovery costs as we kickstart the 5G rollout,"" Dushyan told Reuters. 
DNB however acknowledged its transparency has been questioned, adding that the country's communications regulator would put in place stringent guidelines in public to ensure fair pricing and a smooth rollout. 

""We are working closely with (the regulators). We want the scrutiny, so that people cannot come in and change the principles of what we are aiming with 5G,"" Dushyan said.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Wizz Air CEO says business class flying bad for environment,"LONDON (Reuters) - The boss of Hungarian budget airline Wizz Air attacked the sustainability credentials of traditional airlines like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, saying business class flying was bad for the environment. 
The carbon emissions of airlines has been thrown into the spotlight since travel restarted after the pandemic and as worries over climate change grow. 
Wizz Air's Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told the CAPA industry conference online that there was no place for business class on short-haul flights. 
""Why do we have to fly business class, especially on short haul? A business passenger occupies a lot more space therefore the environmental footprint of your passenger is much greater,"" he said on Wednesday. 
The comments came as world leaders gathered on Wednesday at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, where a number of announcements related to the greening of transportation were expected. 
They also opened a new front in the battle between newer low-cost carriers and older more traditional airlines over tackling the environmental burden. 
Legacy airline leaders including Lufthansa's boss Carsten Spohr have criticised low-cost carriers for offering what they describe as unrealistically low fares to stimulate travel at the expense of the environment. 
Budget airlines like Wizz only offer one class of flying, while full-service airlines like Lufthansa offer different classes with more space for those willing to pay more. 
Varadi said sustainability meant change in future: ""I think that will require some of the airlines to fundamentally rethink how they are doing business and their business approach."" 

British low cost airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said it planned to present further details of its net-zero roadmap in the coming months after committing to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 
British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) agreed to purchase 220,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from Velocys over 10 years, as part of its goal of using 10% SAF by 2030.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge is expected to announce on Wednesday whether Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) must continue defending against tens of thousands of claims that its baby powder and other talc-containing products caused mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.
The pharmaceutical giant is banking on a ruling that would halt ongoing litigation as part of its legal strategy of shifting its talc liabilities onto a newly-created subsidiary, and placing that entity into bankruptcy. 
J&J, which has maintained that its talc products are safe, has already spent nearly $1 billion defending itself in talc-related lawsuits. Settlements and verdicts have cost it about $3.5 billion more, although it has prevailed in some of the cases.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Craig Whitley is expected to rule in a hearing of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of the new J&J entity, LTL Management LLC, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
LTL has asked Whitley to extend protection against litigation that is typically given to bankrupt entities to the non-bankrupt parent company.
LTL has argued that allowing litigation to continue against J&J will defeat the purpose of the bankruptcy, which would allow the company to consolidate and resolve all of the roughly 38,000 talc-related claims.
Some of the plaintiffs suing J&J, however, argue that it should not be able to reap the benefits of bankruptcy protection without filing for bankruptcy itself and that halting litigation will prevent them from having their day in court. One major case that has been pending for five years is on the verge of trial.
A J&J spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Whitley said last week that he would likely issue a ruling on LTL’s request to pause the litigation against J&J at the end of a court hearing on a separate but related matter: whether he will keep the case in his court or transfer it elsewhere.
A government bankruptcy watchdog and people who are suing J&J over its talc products have moved to send the case to New Jersey, where J&J is based and where a large chunk of the talc litigation is consolidated in a federal court.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",GE energy spinoff aims to capture interest in renewables,"By Liz Hampton and Rajesh Kumar Singh
(Reuters) -General Electric Co's plan to spin off energy units into a standalone company could attract investors looking for a well-known name in renewables if they can overlook legacy fossil-fuel operations, financial experts said.
Earlier on Tuesday, the 129-year-old conglomerate outlined a plan to split into three publicly traded companies focused on energy, healthcare and aviation.
The energy unit will combine existing wind and gas-fired power turbines and services, and software businesses. The spinoff would be complete in 2024, GE said.
""Customers need GE at its best and at its most focused to help them navigate the energy transition,"" Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said in an interview, referring to utilities and others now moving to solar, wind and hydropower.
The plan echoes that of GE rival Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), which in 2020 spun off its power division to form Siemens Energy. It is also similar to electric utilities  Enel  (ENEI.MI) and  Iberdrola  (OTC:IBDRY)'s (IBE.MC) embrace of renewable power over fossil fuels.
For GE, the divestment could unlock value from component businesses and be welcomed by investors valuing pure-play companies over conglomerates, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners. 
CREDIBLE PLAYER 
""Investors will welcome a known franchise,"" said Pickering. The GE energy unit's size and reputation will make the spinoff ""a meaningful and credible player in the business,"" he said. 
Colin Scarola, an equity analyst at investment firm CFRA Research, added, the spinoff could lead to ""value creation"" in businesses that ""in aggregate have been shrinking and losing money both before and since the pandemic."" 
Shares touched a 3-1/2 year high on the breakup, and finished up 2.6% at $111.29, compared with a 0.35% drop in the S&P 500 index. 
The energy business would encompass equipment and services for gas, coal and wind turbines, hydro-, nuclear and electric power generation. And it would include renewables and digital software operations. 
Servicing coal-fired power plants, which GE classifies as steam, will be an issue for some investors. 
“We'd like to see some resolution for what they’re going to do with their steam business,” said Matt Breidert, managing director for energy transition investing at fund manager Ecofin. GE, he said, needs ""to be a market leader in sustainability, and they’re not there yet.” 
Another hurdle is the loss-making renewables business, which includes wind turbines. That unit has not achieved an annual profit since 2018, and posted a third-quarter loss of $151 million, compared with a $204 million profit in GE's power group which includes gas turbines.

The company also holds a 16% stake in oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Co remaining from its ill-timed and short-lived 2017 acquisition. Baker Hughes is moving to offer energy transition services and could compete with the future GE energy spinoff. 
But the projected size of the market may prove more enticing. Annual spending to limit global warming to under 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050 could cost more than $3 trillion, estimates the UN-backed International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Investing.com -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock drifted down by 0.7% in premarket trade on Wednesday, after the European Union's top court dismissed its appeal against a $2.8 billion antitrust fine levied by the European Commission.
The European Court of Justice upheld the Commission's 2017 ruling that stated Alphabet's Google unit had discriminated against third-party advertisers in the way it presented results for shopping searches. It's one of three antitrust rulings from the EU that have led to over 8 billion euros ($9.2 billion) in fines so far. The other two rulings affected its Adsense business and its dominance of the Android operating system for mobile devices.
Alphabet has already separated its Google Shopping business operationally from the core search business in response to the ruling. 
Alphabet had earlier this week become the third company in history, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), to reach a market value of $2 trilllion, having risen 67% since the start of the year thanks to a buoyant advertising market.
It was the only one of the Big Tech megacaps whose third-quarter earnings were received posittively, beating expectations for both revenue and earnings handily, as its core advertising business proved relatively immune to the privacy changes on Apple's operating system that hurt other ad-based platforms.

MUNICH (Reuters) -Siemens Energy proposed on Wednesday to pay a dividend on the back of a strong jump in cash flow driven by stricter cost discipline, as it completed its first business year since it spun off from former parent Siemens.
The supplier of turbines and services to the power industry, in which Siemens still holds a direct stake of 35%, said more rigorous demands on clients to make down payments for contracts had partly driven a 39% cash flow rise to 1.36 billion euros ($1.57 billion).
It proposed a dividend of 0.10 euros per share, below the 1.13 euro per share Refinitiv estimate, despite a full-year net loss of 560 million euros triggered by restructuring costs and operating issues at its wind turbine unit.
It also provided an upbeat outlook, expecting its adjusted core profit margin before special items to improve to 3-5% in 2022 from 2.3% this year.
""The measures we have started in the business year 2021 to improve the group's competitiveness are making an impact,"" Chief Executive Christian Bruch said at the group's annual press conference.
Shares in the group were up 1.4%, among the top gainers in Germany's blue-chip index.
Bruch said he was satisfied with recent efforts by Siemens Gamesa, the world's top maker of offshore wind turbines in which Siemens Energy owns 67%, to turn around its struggling onshore division.
""Management has done a lot in recent months,"" Bruch said, striking a different tone than in August when he lashed out at the group for being a drag on Siemens Energy's performance.

Bruch said the group had still not decided on a full takeover of Siemens Gamesa, a deal that would currently cost it 4.63 billion euros excluding a premium, saying such a step would have to create value for shareholders.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) expects the global semi-conductor shortage to remain well into 2022, it said as it posted a 10% rise in fourth-quarter revenue on soaring demand for chips used in everything from cars to home appliances.
Shares of the company rose 2% in Wednesday morning trade.
Infineon, which gets about 40% of sales from the automotive sector, also forecast revenue of 3 billion euros for its coming first quarter, exceeding the 2.97 billion euros expected in a poll of 19 analysts by Vara Research.
""Demand is by far outstripping supply,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said on a call with analysts. 
""Supply is bound to catch up with demand eventually, but we do not see this happening on a broader scale within 2022,"" he said.
The leading supplier of chips to the auto industry is benefiting from a tailwind as more carmakers shift to electric vehicles, along with demand for chips used in consumer appliances and industrial equipment.
The company is also investing heavily to expand its manufacturing capacities - for silicon as well as for the compound semiconductors silicon carbide and gallium nitride.
Last month, the Munich-based chipmaker said it would invest about 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in 2022, up from about 1.6 billion this year. 
Infineon's revenue rose to 3 billion euros ($3.47 billion) from 2.72 billion in the fourth quarter, ahead of expectations of 2.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Rival chipmaker STMicroelectronics also reported bullish earnings in its latest quarterly report. 
Infineon forecast 2022 revenue of between 12.2 billion and 13.2 billion euros, in line with expectations. It also increased its dividend by 5 euro cents to 27 euro cents per share.

BetMGM, a U.S. rival to DraftKings, is jointly owned by Entain and NYSE-listed casino group MGM. 
MGM's chief had said he would have sought to take control of BetMGM if DraftKings had agreed to buy Entain, a deal which would have made the combined group a competitor to MGM in the United States. 
The complication was long viewed as a barrier to DraftKings' pursuit of Entain, but Entain Chief Executive Officer Jette Nygaard-Andersen's remarks are the first public admission from either party that the venture played a role in deal talks ending.
""We have always been clear that the joint venture (with MGM) provides exclusivity for both parties for any activities involving sports betting and gaming in the United States,"" Nygaard-Andersen said in an interview. ""I think that played a role here but any transaction of this size is complicated.""
Both Entain, the owner of  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) betting shops as well as many online betting brands, and DraftKings have expressed confidence in their individual prospects.
Dealmaking in the betting industry has been heating up this year as the United States opens up to sports betting and companies look to tap into the expertise of companies forged in more developed gambling markets such as Britain.
Separately, Nygaard-Andersen, among the few women bosses at British blue-chip groups, said Entain was launching a diversity initiative to train or educate 1 million people by 2030 as part of a 100-million-pound ($135 million) commitment. 

FTSE 100-listed Entain said the initiative was aimed at candidates from under-represented groups to pursue careers in technology.

France's second-biggest listed lender did not benefit from the rebound in equity trading in the quarter as it is less exposed to the equity derivatives market than European peers.
Revenue in capital markets was down 18.7%. That compares with a 8.4% rise in capital markets revenue at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and a 1.2% increase at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Nevertheless, Chief Executive Philippe Brassac made clear that Credit Agricole would not change its strategy in the investment banking landscape to bet on what he called a short-term opportunity as the COVID-19 crisis was not over yet.
""It is a matter of long-term policy on our side,"" Brassac told reporters.
Shares in Credit Agricole were down 1.75% by 0928 GMT, underperforming a rise of 0.30% in the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index.
Analysts at JP Morgan and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said revenue in capital markets was below expectations as well as in insurance, but higher in financing activities, French retail banking and asset management.
Credit Agricole said net income rose 43.5% in the third quarter to 1.40 billion euros ($1.62 billion) and beat a mean forecast for 1.23 billion in a poll of analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue was up 7.4% at 5.53 billion euros, above analysts' forecast of 5.46 billion, while its cost of risk, reflecting provisions against bad loans, fell by 56.1%.
Brassac confirmed the lender was on track to meet its 2022 targets, including a net profit of 5 billion euros.
""There is no reason today to change our target,"" Brassac said.

In retail banking, revenue was up 5.1% in France and rose 32.6% in Italy, where the lender acquired local lender Creval this year. 
In corporate and investment banking (CIB), revenue was down 3.7%, led by a drop of 23.7% in fixed income, currency and commodities trading.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Allianz (DE:ALVG) nudged its forecast for record profit in 2021 even higher on Wednesday after a bumper third quarter while it tries to work out how much money it may need to set aside for a U.S. investigation into its fund management division. 
The German insurer said it expected operating profit to be close to 13 billion euros ($15 billion), up from a previous forecast of between 12 billion and 13 billion and above a record of 11.9 billion euros in 2019, before the pandemic struck.
Allianz abandoned its profit target last year due to the economic uncertainty resulting from the spread of the coronavirus and reported its first decline in operating profit in nearly a decade.
Like other insurance companies, Allianz faced clients making claims for business interruptions and cancelled events due to lockdowns, while demand for car and travel insurance also fell.
The earnings rebound has been overshadowed, however, by a case involving possible misconduct by fund managers at Allianz, which is also one of the world's largest asset managers.
The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating losses at Allianz's Structured Alpha funds during the wild stock market swings of early 2020.
More than two dozen U.S. institutional investors have sued Allianz for a combined $6 billion in damages and Berenberg analysts have estimated the insurer could face a total hit of $8 billion from the lawsuits and fines in a worst-case scenario.
Chief Financial Officer Giulio Terzariol said the company was moving towards getting a clearer picture of any provisions it may need to set aside for possible U.S. fines and litigation. 
He told reporters the company was not committing or promising to give an estimate before the end of 2021, ""but it is something that we are working toward"".
In the third quarter, the insurer's net profit attributable to shareholders come in at 2.111 billion euros, up from 2.063 billion euros a year earlier and ahead of a consensus forecast of 2.044 billion.

Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete said it was the company's strongest third quarter on record.
The quarterly figures got a boost from Allianz divisions for asset management, which benefits from rising markets, and health and life insurance, the company said.

The shares jumped as much as 10% in early trading and were on track for their best performance since March 2020, boosting the company's market value by more than one billion euros, based on Refinitiv data.
Analysts from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and JP Morgan welcomed  Alstom  (PA:ALSO)'s the cash outflow as ""reassuring"" and ""better than feared"".
Alstom had finalised its purchase of Bombardier Transportation early this year - a 5.5 billion euro deal that should make the French train maker the second-biggest player in its sector behind China's CRRC.
But stabilising some legacy projects had caused Alstom to predict ""significant"" cash outflows for its current financial year.
Alstom reported a negative free cash flow of 1.46 billion euros ($1.69 billion) for April to September 2021, beating consensus forecasts and the negative 1.6-1.9 billion euros it had guided in July.
A year earlier, Alstom had reported half-year outflows of just 253 million euros.
In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said the group's cash had benefited from more downpayments and a ramp-up in production. 
Alstom reported ""no material impact"" from supply chain problems in its first half, but Poupart-Lafarge said that delays could have an impact in the next six months.
The CEO added the integration of the rail business and stabilisation of its projects was ""fully on track"" and that projects were now being managed at a local level, following a period of central assessments.
The company, which makes trains and signalling systems for urban and regional rail networks, confirmed its forecast that it would begin to generate cash from the second half onwards, as well as its mid-term financial targets.

It reported a 14% increase in half-year sales, adjusting for acquisitions and foreign exchange rates, while its adjusted net profit for the period edged up to 172 million euros.

LONDON (Reuters) -  ITV  (LON:ITV), Britain's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, expects strong demand from the recovering economy to drive advertising revenue to a record high this year, it said on Wednesday.
The company, which made ""Vigil"", ""Endeavour"" and ""Love Island"", said both its broadcasting and production businesses had recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue at both divisions in the nine months to Sept. 30 exceeded levels for the same period last year and in pre-pandemic 2019.
ITV reported overall revenue for the nine months to Sept. 30 of 2.38 billion pounds ($3.2 billion), up 28% year on year.
Chief Executive Carolyn McCall described the performance as an ""outstanding"" nine months ""by any standards"".
Shares in the company jumped as much as 10% in early trade to a 12-week high of 121 pence.
The company said it expects advertising revenue to grow by 24% this year, helped by a buoyant market and the ability to deliver millions of viewers on its main channels and targeted audiences on video on demand.
McCall has focused on improving the broadcaster's video-on-demand offer, which had fallen short of standards set by streaming specialists such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
She said that a redesigned ITV hub resulted in a 22% increase in monthly active users to 9.6 million and a 39% rise in advertising revenue on the platform.
While competing with ITV for viewers' attention, streaming services are also buyers of productions by ITV Studios.
The company said it expects continued strong revenue growth from streaming platforms, led by shows such as ""Snowpiercer"" for Netflix.
On ITV's own channels, the European soccer championship finals, ""Love Island"" and dramas such as ""Manhunt: The Night Stalker"" and ""Vera"" delivered strong ratings, helping the broadcaster's channels lift their share of British viewers to 22.5% from 22.2%.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 04:30AM ET</span>",Column: A winter of market confusion,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - If any investor tells you they are sure of what happens next in macro markets, they are likely to be fibbing.
Such is the confusion in policy and investment circles right now over the course of inflation, output, jobs, financial prices and central bank policy that the next 3-6 months is likely impossible to predict with any conviction.
Ironically, there appears to be much less uncertainty over the long-term horizon - where risk premia have traditionally been far higher because more things can go bump in the night over elongated time spans.
But it may be easier for forecasters to look beyond unprecedented pandemic-related supply bottlenecks and labour market distortions than navigate a Northern winter of still wildly skewed economic statistics and policy nervousness.
After eye-watering swings in short-term interest rates over the past couple of weeks - due in part to bum steers from the world's top central banks - market conviction about the next few months is understandably low.
Again this week, there's been what ING's Rob Carnell called a 'cacophony' of central bank speeches that do little clarify the big picture for ""messy and directionless"" markets and do much more to encourage thoughts of divergence and volatility.
Adding to the complexity, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone by emphasising the Fed is looking closely at labour market disparities rather than just headline numbers in assessing maximum employment.
But his colleagues still sing from very different hymn sheets. On Monday alone, Fed vice president Richard Clarida said conditions for lifting interest rates may just be in place by the end of 2022; St Louis Fed chief James Bullard agreed with markets that there will be two rate hikes by then; but Chicago Fed boss Charles Evans doesn't expect one until 2023.
That even assumes investors can judge the mood of the Fed from who's in the hot seats at the moment. They still don't know if Powell will be re-appointed as chair when his term expires in February. And this week's decision by top bank supervisor Randal Quarles to resign next month leaves at least two vacant seats on the board going into year-end.
Although faced with similar inflation and jobs conundrums, the Fed's overseas peers seem on similarly fractious paths. 
European Central Bank officials have pushed back against market pricing for a small ECB rate rise next year, and chief economist Philip Lane led the charge again this week in insisting higher rates next year could be counterproductive. 
And yet ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said the bank cannot ignore surging house prices, while bank supervisor Andrea Enria stressed that low interest rates are hurting bank margins more than they are boosting lending volumes. 
Faith in Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey's speechifying, meantime, was holed beneath the waterline last week after he spent a month nudging markets into thinking a UK rate rise was possible and then voted against one at last Thursday's meeting. While still pointing to higher rates, he also insists tighter credit does nothing to solve supply-distorted inflation spikes.
A TOSS OF COIN
Returning to fundamental models of where interest rates should end up at the end of the cycle - so-called terminal rates - provides some anchor for bond and currency markets. 
But even that pre-supposes this centrally-mandated global recession and bounce-back of the past 18 months is anything like any other cycle we've seen.
And for many there's simply no consensus now on how we get from here to there. 
A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) survey of its clients this week asked whether markets or central banks were correct in their interest rate expectations over the coming year. The answer was split 50-50 - just like so many other questions it posed on equity or bond positioning.
And it's not just a question of clarity. 
Few envy the central banks' conundrum. Hike too early and they risk shutting down the recovery before it matures; jump the gun on other countries and you risk a rising currency amplifying the hit; or just do nothing and risk inflation entrenching.
Mark Nash at Jupiter's Fixed Income Alternatives thinks the Fed is an ""unenviable position"" and ""has to choose between economic price stability and equity price stability.""
Compounding that dilemma are the financial stability arms of the central banks that warned once again this week that persistently easy money threatened blowing bubbles in everything from equities to crypto tokens and meme stocks.
What are investors to do? Many appear to be just staying long equity, buying inflation protected bonds and crossing fingers.
The seemingly endless sinking of inflation-protected government bond yields to records ever deeper below zero reflects just that. Inflation-linked bond yields are now below -1.1% in the United States, below -2.0% in Germany and below -3.2% in Britain.

Franklin Templeton's Fixed Income CIO Sonal Desai thinks it will come down to post-pandemic labour supply in the end and how quickly returning job seekers can prevent temporary inflation spikes seeding a wage-price spiral. But she admits this could take a lot longer to assess than markets have patience for.
""For now though, investors had better prepare for sluggish labour supply, persistent inflation and rising financial volatility.""

GLASGOW (Reuters) - Swedish automaker Volvo said on Wednesday it had set a price on carbon emissions from its operations of 1,000 Swedish crowns ($116.30) a tonne, part of attempts to ensure all future projects are sustainable.
Announcing the move at global climate talks in Scotland as it joined an imitative to phase out fossil fuel cars and vans, the company said it had deliberately set a relatively high price to ""future proof"" itself.
Negotiators at the COP26 talks are trying to finish rules to create an international carbon market. Put simply, it would allow some countries to pay others to cut emissions - with the aim of pushing much-needed cash into green projects around the world.
Volvo said it was the first automaker to set such a price across its whole operations, as part of its aim to be a climate neutral company by 2040. The price is double the current cost of carbon in the European Union's carbon trading scheme.
Going forward, every new car project would go through a ""sustainability sense-check"", with a carbon price assigned throughout the life of the vehicle, to ensure it would be profitable even under a much higher government-set price. 
“A global and fair price on CO2 is critical for the world to meet its climate ambitions, and we all need to do more,” Björn Annwall, chief financial officer, said in a statement.
“We strongly believe progressive companies should take the lead by setting an internal carbon price. By evaluating future cars on their CO2-adjusted profitability, we expect to accelerate actions that will help us identify and reduce carbon emissions already today.”

Also on Wednesday, Volvo signed up to the Glasgow Declaration on Zero Emission Cars and Vans, along with peers including Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM), aiming to end production of internal combustion engines by 2040.

Construction of the factory, which local media said last month would supply semiconductors to Sony's image sensor business, will begin in 2022, with production slated to begin at the end of 2024, the companies said in a press release.
The decision marks a success for Japanese industry ministry officials, who want world No.1 contract chipmaker TSMC to build plants to supply chips to Japan's electronic device makers and auto companies as trade friction between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains and demand for the key component grows. 
""The fab (plant) is expected to directly create about 1,500 high-tech professional jobs and to have a monthly production capacity of 45,000 12-inch wafers,"" Sony and TSMC said.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, boosted by solid corporate earnings ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data. 
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded largely flat, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%.
The European quarterly corporate earnings season is in full swing, and has been generally supportive for the overall market. 
The good news largely continued Wednesday, with Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) stock soaring over 15% to their highest in two years after the British retailer beat forecasts for first-half profit and raised its full-year outlook, suggesting its latest attempt at an elusive turnaround is succeeding.
 Alstom  (PA:ALSO) stock climbed over 8% after the French train maker reported a smaller-than-expected cash outflow for the first half of its financial year, as it integrates the rail unit it bought from Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) stock rose 2.2% after the German chipmaker reported a sharp rise in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue amid robust demand for its chips, which are used in everything from cars to mobile telephones. It also forecast a strong fiscal 2022.
ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) stock gained 3.5% after the Dutch bank announced a stock buyback on the back of reporting an unexpected 14% increase in third-quarter profit. 
On the flip side, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) stock fell 4.7% after the German sportswear company cut full-year sales and profit forecasts, citing sourcing disruptions caused by Covid-19 outbreaks, notably in Vietnam.
Away from corporate earnings, investors on both sides of the Atlantic will be keeping a wary eye on the release of the latest U.S. consumer price index later Wednesday, amid concerns that high levels of inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates earlier than expected.
Data released earlier Wednesday showed China's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, while German consumer prices rose 4.5% on the year in October, a considerable jump from the 4.1% level seen in September. 
Crude prices rose again Wednesday, after industry data showed a surprise 2.5 million barrel reduction in U.S. crude stockpiles, reinforcing the view that supply will remain constrained as demand continues to improve.
A build of about 1.9 million barrels had been expected. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's data are due later at 10:30 AM ET. 
By 3:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $84.25 a barrel, having gained 2.7% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $85.16, adding to the previous session’s 1.6% gain. Both contracts closed at their highest levels since Oct. 27.

There's no respite for global policymakers from the dreaded “I” word. They may have spent the greater part of the last two weeks reiterating their belief that high inflation is transitory, but markets remain wary of buying into that message. 
Hardly surprising, given recent data prints. Chinese factory gate prices gained at their fastest clip in a quarter century, according to latest data, which follows on from Tuesday's solid production inflation reading in the United States. 
Then add in a fourth straight day of higher oil prices, with Brent crude at $85 a barrel. 
The widening disconnect between policymakers mantra and economic data pushed Wall Street into the red on Tuesday, ending an eight-session run of all-time closing highs.
So despite a slew of forecast-beating company results -- the bumper Q3 earnings season has seen 81% of the S&P 500 names beating estimates so far -- European and U.S. stock futures are pointing south on Wednesday.
The nervousness around price pressures is even more palpable in bond markets, where investors are rushing to scoop up inflation-linked debt. Inflation-linked, or ""real"" bond yields are now below -1.1% in the United States, below -2.0% in Germany, and below -3.2% in Britain.
Then there are swirling concerns about China's cash-strapped Evergrande's ability to make an offshore bond payment before a Wednesday deadline, and what you have is Wall Street's “fear gauge”, the VIX at a one-month high.
The safe-haven Japanese yen too is catching a bid, taking the dollar to a one-month low below 112 yen. 
Another test looms. The U.S. consumer price index, due later on Wednesday, is predicted by a Reuters poll of economists to come in at an annualised 4.3%, versus the Fed's average annual 2% inflation target.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
-Macro corner: German CPI, Italian industrial production, U.S. initial jobless claims.
-Japan manufacturers' mood falls to 7-month low
-Allianz raises full year outlook after a better-than-expected 2.3% rise in Q3 net profit.

-Credit Agricole Q3 profit beat expectations due to lower bad loan provisions and higher retail revenue
- Shares of China's Fantasia Holdings developer plunged 50% after it said there is no guarantee it can meet debt obligations

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>","Analysis-Caveat emptor: Chile stocks look cheap, but political risk is rising","By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chile's market darling status is threatened by its economic and political outlook, but investors see an opportunity as the South American country heads into a presidential election with no clear favorite while also rewriting its constitution.
Chile's local stocks are back in the black for the year following the rise of right-wing presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast ahead of first-round elections on Nov. 21. But the index priced in dollars is on track for a fourth straight negative yearly return. 
An index of Chilean stocks traded on U.S. exchanges is nearly flat for the year.
The sharp decline in the currency is partly to blame, but the declines have come even with Chile expected to post double-digit GDP growth this year and its central bank one of the world's most hawkish as the economy overheats.
Economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) say no matter who wins among the top two polling candidates, Kast or leftist Gabriel Boric, the constitutional reform process ""implies a likely deterioration of the country's fundamentals.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) research agrees, saying public sector debt levels will rise beyond their current estimates in a Kast or Boric win scenario.
""The far-left program encompasses a hefty fiscal expansion relying on what we think are too optimistic assumptions of about 40% of the planned tax collection,"" Diego Pereira, chief economist for the Southern Cone & Peru at JPMorgan, said in a note.
""On the other side, the far-right candidate seems too optimistic on the ability to lower expenditure and taxes and its potential impact on economic growth, in particular given the likely mandate for increased unfunded social entitlements stemming from the Constitutional Convention.""
Chile in May elected a constitutional convention in which left, center-left and independent candidates won more than two-thirds of the seats.
The re-drafting of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship-era constitution is expected to have an important impact on mining, likely raising taxes in the sector.
Yet this year's rise in commodity prices, including for copper, Chile's largest export, makes it an attractive destination for foreign investors. Even if prices drop from current levels, they would likely remain in an area ""beneficial to countries like Chile as far as their export orientation,"" according to Brian Jacobsen, senior investments strategist at Allspring Global Investments.
Despite the upcoming election adding risk to the outlook, ""from our view, neither candidate really looks like a major risk to a continued economic rebound,"" Jacobsen said.
""Nobody's promising people bread and circuses."" 
BUY ON THE CHEAP
In the local market, the leaders and outliers are shipping company Vapores, up near 150% year-to-date, alongside miner SQM and brewer CCU, both up just over 50% so far in 2021.
Foreign net flows into Chilean stocks through the third quarter ran up to $1.67 billion according to data from the Institute of International Finance, far outpacing the net $204 million for all of last year and more than the $1.27 billion seen in the first nine months of 2019.
But the overall underperformance of the index makes Chilean stocks a rebound candidate as well, with EM specialist Tellimer adding them to their top picks for this month as they are considered ""cheap"" and a play on copper demand.
On the policy side, they say ""Chile retains legal safeguards for orthodox economic policy.""
But the uncertainty brought by the constitutional changes is a step too far as it implies a will to drift away from Chile's economic model, according to Daniel Grana, manager of EM equity portfolios at Janus Henderson.

""We don't know the end result of it, but it would seem probable that it involves a lot more social spending at the expense of a much higher tax rate on the mining sector,"" he said.
In that scenario, Grana added, ""political governance will dilute the benefit to minority shareholders of what we expect to be a very strong copper outlook.""

Over the past several months, the FDA has authorized  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s boosters for people who are immunocompromised, those who are aged 65 and above, all people at high risk of severe disease, and people who are regularly exposed to the virus. 
Pfizer previously requested authorization for all people aged 16 or over, but the FDA held back on extending boosters to everyone, partly because there was not enough evidence of waning immunity or of the benefit of boosters in younger people.
Pfizer said it would present data from a large clinical study which last month showed that a booster dose of its vaccine was 95.6% effective against the coronavirus when compared to a vaccinated group that did not get the third shot.
The company and U.S. health officials have argued that boosters prevent hospitalizations and deaths and that they can slow mild infections as well.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in August announced plans to roll out booster doses for all adults in September, before the FDA's advisers had recommended a limited authorization. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is likely to file a request with the U.S. FDA to broaden emergency use authorization of its boosters in all adults, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter, but said the timing of the filing was not known yet.

Moderna's booster doses have been cleared for use in a similar group of patients to Pfizer's, and a booster shot of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized for use as well. Roughly 25 million Americans had received a booster, as of Monday. 
Moderna did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ABN Amro said on Wednesday it was looking to buy back its shares, as the Dutch bank reported an unexpected 14% increase in third-quarter net profit helped by economic recovery and the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns.
""Developments in the third quarter were encouraging,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Swaak said.
""Demand for lending showed signs of recovery and both our mortgage book and corporate loan book grew.""
Credit demand was helped by the lifting of many coronavirus restrictions in the Netherlands, as bars, restaurants and stores were gradually allowed to reopen in recent months.
Interest income dropped 18% in the three months to Sept. 30, as low rates continued to bite the interest margin, but the drop was less dramatic than analysts had feared. 
This pushed up ABN's net profit to 343 million euros ($396 million), while analysts in a company-compiled poll had predicted it to fall on average to 147 million euros, from 301 million a year ago.
The largely state-owned lender resumed dividend payments last month and said it was now in a ""constructive dialogue"" with the Dutch central bank about the possibility to start buying back shares after the first quarter of next year.

ABN, one of the three dominant banks in the Netherlands, was re-privatised six years ago after its bailout in the 2008 financial crisis, but the Dutch state still owns 56% of the shares and hasn't sold any since September 2017.

1007,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 02:03AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Edge Lower; Corporate Earnings, U.S. CPI Due","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Wednesday, amid caution ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation data, fresh concerns over the health of the Chinese property market. 
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
Investors on both sides of the Atlantic will be keeping a wary eye on the release of the latest U.S. consumer price index later Wednesday, amid concerns that high levels of inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates earlier than expected.
Data released on Tuesday saw the headline annual rate of U.S. producer price inflation come in at 8.6% and the core rate at 6.8%, nearly twice as high as at any time in the last 10 years.
The theme of high inflation continued Wednesday, as data from China showed that the country's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, while German consumer prices rose 4.5% on the year in October, a considerable jump from the 4.1% level seen in September. 
Another factor prompting caution is the health of China's property industry, with developer Fantasia Holdings warning Wednesday it might not be able to meet its debt obligations. The country’s biggest developer China Evergrande Group faces its biggest solvency test yet Wednesday with over $148 million of coupon payments due on three dollar bonds.
It's also a busy day for European corporate earnings. French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit, supported by lower pandemic-related provisions for bad loans.
German insurer Allianz's (DE:ALVG) profit also beat expectations, rising 2.3%, while the Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) announced a stock buyback after reporting an unexpected 14% increase in third-quarter profit.
Crude prices rose again Wednesday, after industry data showed a surprise 2.5 million barrel reduction in U.S. crude stockpiles, reinforcing the view that supply will remain constrained as demand continues to improve.
A build of about 1.9 million barrels had been expected. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's data are due later at 10:30 AM ET. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $84.42 a barrel, having gained 2.7% on Tuesday, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $85.37, adding to the previous session’s 1.6% gain. Both contracts closed at their highest levels since Oct. 27.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,827.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1575.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:57AM ET</span>","GE, an industrial conglomerate pioneer, to break up","By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Abhijith Ganapavaram
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co will split into three public companies as the storied U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to simplify its business, pare down debt and breathe life into a battered share price, the company said on Tuesday.
The split marks the end of the 129-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power. 
GE shares closed 2.6% higher at $111.29 on Tuesday, after reaching a nearly 3-1/2 year high, compared with a 0.35% drop in the broader S&P 500 index. The industrial conglomerate's shares have gained about 9% since July 30 when the company reduced the number of its traded shares.
In the past three years, GE Chief Executive Larry Culp has focused on reducing debt by selling assets, and improving cash flows by streamlining operations and cutting overhead costs.
""With the progress on the deleveraging, the progress with our operational transformation, the pandemic lifting ... there's no reason to wait a day (for the split),"" Culp told Reuters in an interview. ""It's the right thing to do."" 
The Boston-based company said the three businesses would focus on energy, healthcare and aviation.
GE will separate the healthcare company, in which it expects to retain a stake of 19.9%, in early 2023. It will combine GE Renewable Energy, GE Power and GE Digital and spin off the business in early 2024. 
Following the split, it will become an aviation company, helmed by Culp. The aviation company will inherit GE's other assets and liabilities, including its runoff insurance business.
A company spokesperson said brands and names of the spun-off units will be decided later.
It is the boldest attempt under Culp, who took GE's reins in 2018, to simplify the company's business. Measures taken so far have led to an improvement in GE's balance sheet, putting it on track to reduce debt by more than $75 billion by the end of 2021. 
The company now expects to generate more than $7 billion in free cash flow in 2023 and is planning to monetize its stakes in Baker Hughes, AerCap and the healthcare unit to cut its net debt to less than $35 billion by then. 
Culp told Reuters the decision to split the company was paved by GE's progress in terms of repairing its balance sheet and operational performance.
He did not expect the spinoff to face any regulatory or labor issues and said there was no investor pressure behind the decision.
""Spins create a lot of value,"" he said in the interview. ""These are moves geared toward making GE stronger, helping our businesses and the teams perform better.""
INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE
Culp's strategy is in stark contrast to the path GE pursued in the 1980s and 1990s under Jack Welch, who expanded the company into an industrial behemoth.
A founding member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896, GE spent more than a century in that storied stock index before getting the boot in 2018 following years of sliding valuation. It created the first electric cooking range and clothes washer, the first nuclear power plant, and supplied the U.S. space program. Its interests have spanned television, movies and insurance to lightbulbs and locomotives.
However, it has been facing investor skepticism about its ability to turn a corner since the 2008 financial crisis, while struggling with debt. The sagging fortunes prompted the company to fire Chief Executive John Flannery and hand over the reins to Culp.
For a graphic, see https://tmsnrt.rs/30eqk2r.
The company's revenue for 2020 was $79.62 billion, a far cry from the $180 billion-plus in revenue it booked in 2008.
In 2015, activist investor Nelson Peltz took a stake in GE and demanded changes at the company, including moving away from finance operations and toward its industrial roots. On Tuesday, Peltz's company, Trian, said it ""enthusiastically supports this important step in the transformation of GE.""
GE's aviation business, usually its cash cow, makes jet engines for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY). Questions remain over how the company will fund the unit's operations, which tend to be very capital-intensive.
The company reckons the aviation unit's low-cost structure, strong order book and investment-grade balance sheet would let it tap capital markets. But some analysts say the unit's valuation could suffer as it will also take over GE's financial liabilities after the split.
""There is clearly a debate among investors as to how much the aviation valuation should be penalized vs peers because of the financial liabilities,"" analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note.
An industry source, however, said the aviation business has been distracted until now by propping up rest of the company, which took a lot of the unit's bandwidth. The unit is expected to be valued at more than $100 billion after the spinoff, the source added.

Culp also said the split would make different units ""more focused"" and result in ""greater accountability.""
The company expects to take a one-time charge of $2 billion related to separation and operational costs and tax costs of less than $500 million.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Cloud service provider Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) on Wednesday said it was partnering with Indian telecoms group Bharti Airtel's data centre unit in an expansion push that will widen the U.S. company's customer access in one of its fastest-growing markets.
The partnership with Airtel Nxtra will help Oracle, which runs a cloud region in financial capital of Mumbai and another in the southern tech hub of Hyderabad, expand the capacity of its India West region, said Garrett Ilg, President, Oracle Japan and Asia Pacific.
""When we bring a company like Airtel into the conversation they have these relationships with customers ... and that will help us get to that customer base way faster, with way more trust and most importantly with way less risk,"" Ilg told Reuters.
Ilg did not disclose financial terms of the Oracle-Airtel collaboration.
For Oracle, the tie-up marks the opportunity to sell cloud services to Airtel's more than a million India enterprise customers. It's also a chance to tap tens of millions of small businesses looking to use digital services in a market where public cloud spending is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2025, according to tech researcher  Gartner  (NYSE:IT).
The arrangement also boosts Airtel's data centre expansion drive - for which it has committed to invest more than $673 million- helping the company add new revenue streams and lure enterprise clients who typically offer higher margins.
Airtel competes with billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio telecoms venture, which forged an alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2019 to build data centres across India. This year Jio partnered with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to boost its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
Ilg said Oracle was going to hire thousands of employees annually over the next few years, highlighting the Austin, Texas-headquartered company's focus on India.

Separately, Oracle also said it was opening a cloud region in Singapore which will help it offer enterprise cloud services in Southeast Asia, another key market for the U.S. company.
Oracle will also invest as much as $30,000 in the city state's startups to help them enhance their cloud capabilities, Ilg added.

The rebound was driven by 167 deals including 13 mega rounds, which accounted for $2 billion of the total funding, according to the report by United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY), PwC Singapore and the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA).
Mega rounds are those which raise $100 million or more.
Late-stage fintech firms, or those in their series C funding and beyond, garnered most interest, with involvement in 10 of 13 mega rounds this year, as investors took a more risk-adverse approach during the pandemic by backing more established firms, the report said.
The payment sector attracted most funding due to greater use of digital payments. Tech and cryptocurrency firms saw the highest growth this year, ranking second and third place respectively. 

Singapore, Southeast Asia's financial hub, accounted for nearly half of the region's deals at $1.6 billion, including six mega rounds worth a combined $972 million.
The next most active was Indonesia, the region's most populous country, with $904 million raised, followed by Vietnam at $375 million.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian insurer FWD Group, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li, is contemplating shifting its $2-$3 billion share sale from the United States to Hong Kong, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The Hong Kong-based company, which filed confidentially in June for the New York initial public offering (IPO), is considering the switch amid delays by U.S. regulators scrutinising the plan and lacklustre interest from investors, the sources told Reuters.
A FWD spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday when asked by Reuters about a possible change in the listing venue. 
The insurer has yet to receive the nod from U.S. regulators for its IPO to go ahead before the end of the year, a timetable that sources had flagged previously.
One source said the delays had increased concerns that approval would not be granted, while the second source cited lukewarm interest from investors.
The uncertainty has prompted FWD and its advisors to consider returning to Hong Kong for its market debut, the two sources said. A final decision has yet to made, a third source said. 
FWD has faced questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on its mainland China ties and has been treated by authorities as a Chinese business rather than a Hong Kong entity, said one of the sources and a fourth person. 
The four sources could not be named as the information has not yet been made public.
FWD last week filed amended prospectuses with the SEC that included an expanded risk factor section, which said the company could not guarantee Beijing would not interfere in its business.
FWD emphasized in the filing it had no mainland business and maintained only representative offices, some information technology and support staff in China.
The SEC has started to issue new disclosure requirements https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-sec-gives-chinese-companies-new-requirements-us-ipo-disclosures-2021-08-23 to Chinese companies seeking to list in New York as part of a push to boost investor awareness of the risks involved, Reuters reported in August.
FWD's foundation was laid in 2012 with the acquisition of ING's Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand business units for $2.1 billion, and it has since continued this bolt-on approach to expand in the region.
It now has a business presence in 10 markets in Asia and sources previously estimated the New York IPO would value the company at between $13 billion and $15 billion.
SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURE
A Hong Kong listing would require FWD to change its dual-class shareholding structure, given it has weighted voting rights. Hong Kong's listing rules only permit weighted voting rights for innovative companies and FWD does not fit the exchange's definition of that category.
There has been indicative interest in up to $500 million worth of the shares to be sold in the planned New York IPO, according to the firm's filings.

The foundation of Richard Li's father Li Ka-Shing, Hong Kong's richest man, has indicated it could buy up to $300 million worth of stock. Richard Li's PCCW Ltd, a major internet service provider in Hong Kong, could take $100 million, the filings showed.
FWD's controlling shareholder, Pacific Century Group – another Richard Li firm – has also flagged its interest to invest $100 million.

In other developments, Evergrande’s electric-vehicle unit sold shares at a deep discount, and Fantasia Holdings Group Co. plunged as much as 52% in Hong Kong following a six-week halt after the company’s surprise default. 
The Securities Times report on debt issuance rules sparked what would be the biggest jump in three weeks for China’s junk-rated dollar bonds. Higher-quality issuers such as Country Garden Holdings Co. and CIFI Holdings Group Co. saw some of their bonds rise more than 4 cents. Before Wednesday’s rally, a Bloomberg index for China’s high-yield market had dropped 13 of the last 14 trading days, putting yields at 24.6%.
Key Developments:
China Fallen Angel Risks Flare as Shimao Cut to Junk (12:30 p.m. HK)
Major Chinese property developer Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. lost its investment-grade rating at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, adding to concerns about a spate of downgrades amid a property industry debt crisis that’s already pushed some firms’ borrowing costs to decade highs.
Shimao’s long-term rating was downgraded to BB+ from BBB- with a negative outlook, according to a S&P statement Wednesday. That reverses a move S&P made just seven months ago, when it raised the firm to BBB-. 
The developer is China’s 13th biggest by contracted sales and among the largest property debt issuers with about $10.1 billion in outstanding local and offshore bonds. The company already has a junk Ba1 long-term rating from Moody’s Investors Service. It still has an investment-grade rank of BBB- at Fitch Ratings.
 
Fantasia Plunges After Month-Long Trading Halt (9:35 a.m. HK)
Fantasia shares opened 50% lower at HK$0.28 in Hong Kong after trading was suspended for more than a month. The developer’s woes have been mounting after two directors quit the troubled Chinese developer last month and it defaulted on a dollar bond. 
Evergrande Faces Payment Test as Grace Periods End (8:20 a.m. HK)
Evergrande is facing its biggest payment test since signs of a liquidity crisis emerged at the firm five months ago. 
Investors are waiting to see if the embattled developer makes coupon payments totaling $148.1 million for three dollar bonds before the end of 30-day grace periods Wednesday. Evergrande missed the initial interest deadlines last month, Bloomberg-compiled data show.  
The due date looms as credit-market stress spreads beyond China’s junk-rated builders. Higher-quality dollar bonds are suffering their worst selloff in months, as investors grow increasingly concerned about the impact on larger property firms and the broader economy. 
While there’s been no indication that Evergrande will miss the payment, any such development could also trigger cross-default clauses among the builder’s $19.2 billion of outstanding dollar notes and give creditors more room to negotiate.  
Developer CIFI Plans Rights Issue After Bond Market Shuts (8:15 a.m. HK)
With the bond market all but closed for China’s embattled real-estate industry, one developer is tapping shareholders for fresh capital to weather the storm.
The planned rights issue from Hong Kong-listed CIFI Holdings Group Co. offers a potential funding road map for Chinese property companies with highly concentrated ownership. CIFI, led by Chairman Lin Zhong, is seeking to raise as much as HK$1.68 billion ($216 million), according to a filing Tuesday.
Rules for China Developers to Issue Bonds May Be Eased: Report (8:13 a.m. HK)
China is likely to loosen controls for domestic real estate companies to issue local-currency bonds soon as part of efforts to prevent a further deterioration in their financing, according to the official Securities Times.
The easing will center on the interbank bond market, which has seen issuance from developers fall in the past year. Banks and other institutional investors will resume “blood transfusions” for real estate enterprises through bond investment, the Securities Times said Wednesday in a front-page report. 
Authorities sent the policy signal at a meeting on Tuesday between some developers and the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, which is under the country’s central bank and shares oversight of corporate bond issuance in the interbank market.
Evergrande NEV to Raise HK$500m in Stock at Discount (8:10 a.m. HK)
China Evergrande Group’s electric-car unit plans to raise HK$500 million ($64 million) in a share sale, which it says will be used to put its long-delayed vehicles into production. 
The stock was priced at HK$2.86 apiece, a 20% discount to yesterday’s closing price, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. said in a statement Wednesday. That’s way off the record high of HK$72.25 the stock reached in February, before a selloff as the unit’s parent company battled to stave off collapse. 
As recently as September, Evergrande NEV warned of a serious shortage of funds, saying it had suspended paying some of its operating expenses and some suppliers had stopped work, stoking concern it wouldn’t be able to start mass production of its long-awaited electric vehicles.

That plant is the main factory responsible for making Santanas in China and has the capacity to manufacture 224,400 units a year. 
Volkswagen did not directly comment on its plans for the Santana but said in a statement to Reuters consumer tastes had shifted away from sedans toward SUVs. 
""Customer preferences are gradually shifting away from notchback ICE (NYSE:ICE) (internal combustion engine) models towards BEV (battery electric vehicle) and SUV models,"" the company said. 
Production of Santanas began in China in 1985 and Volkswagen said more than 6 million had been delivered to Chinese customers over the years. It was unclear whether Volkswagen would continue to make Santanas in other markets.
The affordable sedans - which became status symbols in the 1990s as China's economy boomed - have been credited with helping Volkswagen break into the Chinese market and rise to the top rank of foreign automakers there in terms of sales. 
Volkswagen sold 3.85 million vehicles in China last year, ahead of second-ranked foreign manufacturer General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), thanks in part to its shift in focus to more popular and profitable SUV models. 
Competition in the family car market has intensified with the entry of more international rivals and Chinese firms, putting pressure on some of the established foreign manufacturers. 

In the first 10 months of this year, SAIC-Volkswagen sold 970,438 vehicles, down 18% from a year earlier. Companies such as Hyundai Motor,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Suzuki Motor have shut plants, exited joint ventures or quit the Chinese market entirely. 
Instead of Santanas and Rapids, the Yizheng plant would make T-Cross and facelifted Tharu SUVs, Polo hatchbacks and Lamando sedans, according to the document. These arrangements would be completed in 2023. Volkswagen has other joint ventures with FAW Group and JAC. All ventures are building new plants for electric vehicles.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 11:51PM ET</span>",Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches China playbook with eye toward EV showrooms,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp is revamping its playbook in its home country by opening thousands of new stores to spur domestic sales growth in a highly competitive market, and provide a channel for its plans to sell electric vehicles.
Xiaomi opened its 10,000th store on Oct. 30, capping a promise to double its offline store count, and set a fresh target to open 30,000 shops over the next two to three years.
The brick-and-mortar push is a shift for a company that grew rapidly by pioneering online smartphone sales, and shows how some Chinese businesses are responding to persistently soft consumption and slowing economic growth.
But it comes with challenges in the form of higher advertising and inventory costs, analysts said.
""In the future, the company's strategy will tilt more towards offline based on our sales capabilities. Our initial goal is that our offline sales will achieve the same volume as our online sales,"" Shang Jin, Xiaomi's general manager of retail for China, told Reuters.
While Hong Kong-listed Xiaomi has successfully expanded overseas, it lags behind larger rivals such as privately-owned Oppo and Vivo in its home market because of its weak offline presence. About 70% of all smartphones in China are purchased offline, while Xiaomi gets 30% of its sales offline.
Xiaomi's new stores also offer its suite of internet-connected home appliances and cameras which have fatter margins than phones - analysts say about 15% fatter - and set it apart from its rivals. 
Looking ahead, Xiaomi hopes its new stores will become showrooms for its electric cars, which company founder Lei Jun has said will be his last major entrepreneurial project. The company aims to mass produce cars by 2024.
PLAYING CATCH-UP Xiaomi has pursued an online sales model because it helps keep prices low without networks of offline distributors.
This strategy has helped the company grow rapidly from its birth in 2010. It overtook Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the second quarter to become the world's No. 2 smartphone maker, according to market research firm Canalys.
However in its home market, the world's biggest, it has slipped in the rankings from first in 2015 to fourth in the third quarter, lagging behind Vivo, Oppo, and Huawei spin-off Honor. 
As its domestic market share has struggled to keep pace, so have its store openings. Xiaomi opened its first stores in China in 2015 but it is far behind Oppo and Vivo, both owned by BBK Electronics. Shang says those two rivals now have about 200,000 stores in China. 
This year, to increase its store count, Xiaomi altered its offline distribution model to lure in more franchise partners. While it owns some of its stores, it eventually aims for a majority to be franchisees, particularly in rural areas. 
Under this new plan, for certain stores Xiaomi only classifies a device as ""sold"" when a consumer purchases it rather than when it is shipped to middlemen. This lowers inventory risk for the stores and shifts the burden of unsold inventory back to the manufacturer. 
""Compared to store rent and labor cost, inventory is the biggest risk for smartphone retail businesses,"" Shang said, adding that the new system meant ""no stockpiling"".
This helps sweeten the deal for franchisees, who otherwise may balk at Xiaomi's relatively lower margins per phone. ""Xiaomi can't increase their profit margins without increasing their price, which they won't do,"" said Nicole Peng, who tracks China's smartphone market at Canalys. ""So now they're saying to vendors, 'You'll make a smaller margin but I'll take the risk away from you'.""
The new system is not without its costs. Peng said it would force Xiaomi to invest more in offline advertising, which is more expensive than online advertising. 
And since franchisees did not own inventory, they could more easily switch to selling non-Xiaomi products if they were unsatisfied.

In the longer term, Peng said the store expansion made sense for Xiaomi's push into electric cars, which would require dealerships.
""Cars are not standardised and customers demand a lot of customisation based on personal preference. Offline sales are very important for that,"" she said.

Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the company which owns the Nykaa brand, opened at 2,018 rupees in pre-open trade, compared with the initial public offering (IPO) price of 1,125 rupees.
The company's offering last week drew bids worth $32.55 billion as it was oversubscribed by nearly 82 times, signalling strong investor demand for a startup that, unlike many others, has already achieved profitability.
The listing comes at a time when companies attempt to cash in on an Indian market that has scaled record highs on the back of a decline in COVID-19 cases, a reopening of the economy and ample liquidity.
The company, which functions in two broad segments, namely beauty and personal care and apparel & accessories, was incorporated in 2012 and swiftly became a popular name among Indian consumers.
With famous Indian celebrities such as Alia Bhatt and Katrina Kaif investing in the firm, Nykaa currently runs its online operations through mobile applications and websites along with 80 brick-and-mortar stores across the country, as of Aug. 31.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 10:46PM ET</span>","India could ship vaccines to COVAX in a few weeks, say sources","By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India could resume deliveries of COVID-19 shots to global vaccine-sharing platform COVAX in a few weeks for the first time since April, two health industry sources said, ending a suspension of supplies that has hurt poor countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO), which co-leads COVAX, has been urging India to restart supplies for the programme, especially after it sent about 4 million doses to its neighbours and partners in October.
Based on an informal approval from India, COVAX officials have started planning allocations of the Covishield shot for various countries, said one of the sources, both of whom declining to be identified pending a final agreement.
Covishield is a licensed version of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker. 
SII has nearly quadrupled its output of Covishield to up to 240 million doses a month since April, when India stopped all exports in order to inoculate its own people during a surge of cases.
""There will need to be purchase orders confirmed to SII, labelling and packing, export authorisation granted for each of these shipments,"" said the source. ""So the first deliveries, assuming the Indian government grants export authorisation, won't happen until a few weeks from now.""
A WHO spokesperson said in an email that a new COVAX supply forecast would be published next week. SII and India's health ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
The ministry said in a statement earlier in the day that Indian states had more than 159 million unutilised doses of various vaccines, as inoculations have slowed after 79% of the country's 944 million adults got one dose and 37% got two doses.
SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last month that the company could send 20 million to 30 million doses a month to COVAX in November and December, which would increase to ""large volumes"" from January once India's own needs were met.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that COVAX had the money and the contracts to buy vaccines for low-income countries but ""manufacturers have not played their part"".
COVAX in September cut its 2021 delivery target by nearly 30% to 1.425 billion doses.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Amazon-backed electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian sold shares in its initial public offering (IPO) at $78 per share, above its target range, to raise more than $11.93 billion, the company said on Tuesday. 
The flotation ranks among the top 10 IPOs of all time in the United States, according to data from Dealogic. 
Rivian priced an upsized IPO of 153 million shares at $78 per share, the company said https://refini.tv/3EW1vHe. On Friday, Rivian had boosted its price range to $72 to $74 per share, up from an earlier range of $57 to $62. 
The mammoth IPO follows a highly successful investor roadshow last week, with Wall Street's biggest institutional investors betting on Rivian to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
The EV market is witnessing a surge in demand globally, as consumers are growing more environmentally conscious and betting on eco-friendly vehicles. Tesla produced a record number of cars in its latest quarter and is building factories all over the world.
Founded in 2009, Rivian has been investing heavily to ramp up production. It is doubling down on production of its upscale all-electric R1T pickup truck, which was launched in September.
The EV maker had about 55,400 R1T and R1S pre-orders in the United States and Canada as of Oct. 31, according to a recent regulatory filing.
Rivian said it had started deliveries of the R1T and had recorded revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30. The net loss for that period, however, is estimated to increase due to higher production costs.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which recently disclosed it holds an approximately 20% stake in Rivian, has ordered 100,000 of Rivian's electric delivery vans as part of the e-commerce company's broader effort to cut its carbon footprint.

Rivian will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""RIVN"" on Wednesday. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the offering.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden spoke on Tuesday with the chief executives of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) to discuss speeding up deliveries and lowering prices for consumers. 
Biden took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to say he understood the concerns about the supply chain gridlocks and the potential impact on Americans as they brace for the holiday season. He said he had talked to the executives and they were confident people will be able to get the items they want in the upcoming weeks.
""You're going to be able to get to the store, get to the outlets you're looking for, get the products you need, the gifts you want. That's what we've been working on,"" Biden said in the roughly 90-second video posted on Twitter.
Biden, facing political pressure over rising U.S. prices, has been organizing an effort https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supply-chain-too-snarled-biden-christmas-fix-experts-say-2021-10-14 to clear transportation bottlenecks, ease semiconductor shortages and pass a spending bill that officials hope will ease long-term inflation.
""Target CEO Brian Cornell shared that we are ready to deliver a great shopping experience for guests this holiday season,"" the company said in a statement, adding its inventory levels are well above last year's and that it is processing more containers at night.
The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment about their conversations with the president.
Concerns about labor and goods shortages have grown ahead of the U.S. holiday season, when travel and gift buying normally create jobs for workers and profits for retailers. 
Last month, one senior White House official told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/china/with-xi-biden-meeting-us-aims-show-responsible-handling-china-ties-2021-10-21 that ""there will be things that people can't get,"" come Christmastime.
Experts have also said the problems, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic closing factories and putting people out of work globally, were unlikely to be solved quickly.

The shortages have helped lift consumer prices by 5.4% over the 12 months through September, according to the U.S. Labor Department. Due to inflation, most workers' real hourly wages sagged 0.8% over the same time frame.
Administration officials said on Tuesday they were working https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-looks-move-quickly-17-bln-revamp-us-ports-2021-11-09 to quickly put to work some of the provisions in the $1 trillion infrastructure package that Congress approved last week to clear backlogs at U.S. ports that have kept some goods from store shelves.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 09:42PM ET</span>",Analysis: Japan's controversial cross-shareholdings get second wind after court battle,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A simmering Tokyo legal battle could embolden Japan Inc to hang on to cross-shareholdings as a defence against hostile takeovers, a setback for corporate governance reforms championed under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The development threatens to sow uncertainty at a time when investors are trying to gauge new premier Fumio Kishida's commitment to pro-market reform and attracting international investors.
The Tokyo District court last month ruled manufacturer Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho could issue a poison pill, rejecting a request for an injunction from top shareholder Asia Development Capital (ADC), which sought to block the move after being excluded from voting on it.
In the absence of ADC, other shareholders approved the poison pill. Owned by Malaysian businessman Anselm Wong, Tokyo-listed ADC built up most of its 40% stake in a matter of weeks, enough to give it veto rights over important board decisions.
Tokyo Kikai's other shareholders include its business partners, reflecting the common practice in Japan where companies take stakes in partners to cement relationships. 
""Cross-shareholdings and special shareholders of various kinds continue to insulate management from having to serve the interests of general shareholders,"" said Tokyo-based corporate lawyer Stephen Givens.
Tokyo Kikai said ADC was excluded from voting because it was an ""interested party"", adding members of company management were also excluded.
But ADC says the fact shareholders with ties to Tokyo Kikai were allowed to vote - including insurer Sompo Japan, Mizuho Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Banking Corp - shows the ""interested party"" definition was arbitrarily applied.
""Interested parties, if broadly interpreted, could also include shareholders with cross-shareholding or business interests,"" said Kazunori Suzuki of Waseda Business School.
On Tuesday, the Tokyo High Court dismissed ADC's latest appeal. The fund has appealed to the supreme court.
Sompo Japan said it holds Tokyo Kikai shares for strategic purposes. It said its policy is to contribute to the sustainable growth of investee companies, and that it exercises its voting rights appropriately, taking into consideration corporate governance and compliance.
Mizuho and SMBC declined to comment on individual shareholdings. Both banks said they vote appropriately at investee firms. Mizuho said its voting took into account governance and long-term value.
'COERCIVE' BIDS, OPAQUE HOLDING
To be sure, some economists such as Cambridge University's Ha Joon Chang say cross-shareholdings - like the presence of workers on company supervisory boards in Germany - can serve as a check on the influence of short-term investors who may neglect investment and over-emphasise dividends and buybacks.
Veteran M&A lawyer Yo Ota, who is advising Tokyo Kikai, said it was reasonable to exclude ADC to give other shareholders a say on the acquisition, especially as they were adversely affected by what he said was the ""coercive"" nature of ADC's bid - when an investor feels compelled to sell or risk having their interests damaged.
Like any other investor, corporate shareholders could be hurt by the acquisition, Ota said. 
ADC said corporate shareholders would not be subject to coercion because they own stakes for non-investment purposes.
While Japanese firms have been slowly unwinding their cross-shareholdings in the last two decades, a third of Japan's $6.6 trillion stock market is still owned by cross-shareholders.
That's down by half since the late 1990s, according to Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research. 
Under Japan's stewardship code, only institutional investors are forced to disclose voting records at shareholder meetings. 
In a recent survey of nearly 1,600 firms by Japanese commercial law journal ""Shoji Homu"", over 60% of the respondents said such allied shareholders account for 40% or more of their registers.
Japan's governance code now requires companies to annually assess whether the purpose of a cross-shareholding is appropriate. 
Companies that have been targets of successful hostile acquisitions in the past year or two have lacked cross-shareholders to protect them, said lawyer Givens.
Several bankers said it would be impossible to end the practice because companies worry about the price impact from a share sale and the prospect of allied shareholders being replaced by activists.

""It's a business practice that you don't see in developed Western countries where the environment forces companies to listen to the opinions of their shareholders,"" said Ken Hokugo, director of Japan's Pension Fund Association.
""The number of shares and amount of shareholder capital that companies spend on this shows the inefficiency and unattractiveness of the Japanese market.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with investors digesting inflation data from China that indicated a build-up of inflationary pressure in the global economy. They now await further data from the U.S.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.18% by 9:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.61%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.7% month-on-month and 1.5% year-on-year in October. The producer price index (PPI) grew by 13.5% year-on-year.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee is also continuing its meeting, which runs to Nov. 11. The meeting is expected to pave the way for an unprecedented third term for President Xi Jinping. Xi will also reportedly meet U.S. President Joe Biden at a virtual summit in the following week.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.50%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.36% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.82%. In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.08%.
Longer maturity U.S. Treasuries halted a rally, with the 30-year yield hitting its lowest level since July 2021 earlier. U.S. bond markets will be closed on Wednesday ahead of a holiday.
On the data front, the U.S. PPI grew 0.6% month-on-month and 8.6% year-on-year. The core PPI grew 0.4% month-on-month, and the CPI  figure is due later in the day.
If inflationary pressures persist and central banks tighten monetary policy at an accelerated pace in response, global shares could fall from their recent, near-record levels. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard noted corporate pricing power and has already penciled in two interest rate hikes in 2022.
However, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly expects “eye-popping” inflation to subside in 2022 as supply-chain bottlenecks subside.
“Because we haven’t seen inflation for a while, people aren’t used to it,” MetLife (NYSE:MET) Investment Management chief market strategist Drew Matus told Bloomberg.
“What we should expect over the next half a year is, as people become more understanding of what the Fed might do, we are going to see more volatility,” he added.
Investors also continue to focus on China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333). The developer faces coupon payments totaling $148.1 million for three-dollar bonds before the end of 30-day grace periods on Wednesday."

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday denied Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s efforts to pause orders handed down after an antitrust case brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games.
The iPhone maker immediately said it would appeal the denial, aiming to stave off potentially significant changes to its lucrative App Store before a Dec. 9 deadline to implement the court's orders.
Epic went to trial earlier this year over Apple's practice of forcing developers to use its in-app payment system and to pay commissions to the iPhone maker. In September, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) issued a ruling that was mostly favorable to Apple.
But she expressed concern that Apple was keeping consumers in the dark about alternative payment methods and ordered Apple to lift its ban on in-app links, buttons and messages to users about other ways to pay.
Apple has appealed the judge's ruling, asking her to pause her orders while the appeals process plays out, which could take several years.
In a sharp rebuke to the iPhone maker, Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple's prohibitions on telling consumers about other payment methods showed ""incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins"" for its App Store.
She wrote that Apple's own in-app payment methods would still be more convenient than third-party methods and that many consumers might still choose to use it.
""The fact remains: it should be their choice,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote. ""Consumer information, transparency, and consumer choice is in the interest of the public.""

Apple said it will appeal Gonzalez Rogers' denial to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which could grant Apple a temporary stay before the Dec. 9 deadline.
""Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,"" Apple said in a statement.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Latin America's largest airline, LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), reported losses of some $692 million in the third quarter on Tuesday, as the indebted company said it was still battling challenges from the coronavirus pandemic.
LATAM's total revenue climbed to $1.31 billion in the July-September quarter, an increase of 156% compared with the same period last year, but only around half the level compared with before the pandemic struck in early 2020.
""Despite the pandemic, which is not over yet and that is still having an impact, we have managed to close a third quarter with better operational performance in all businesses,"" Finance Vice President Ramiro Alfonsín told reporters.
The result was supported by a better performance in the domestic travel market and solid cargo business, balancing weaker performance on international routes hit by global travel restrictions that are still in flux.
The operating capacity for the quarter averaged close to half the pre-pandemic level and the airline said it expected to reach around 65% of that level by the end of the year. Alfonsín said he expected the airline's key Brazilian operation to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 or early 2022.
In May 2020, LATAM filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States, due to the impact of the restrictions related to the pandemic. Alfonsín said on Tuesday that the airline would present the reorganization plan this month.

""Now we are finalizing the last details of our reorganization plan, for that we are meeting with stakeholders and we hope to present by November 26,"" he said.
The airline, born from the merger of Chile's LAN with Brazilian rival TAM in 2012, has operating units in Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Peru.

(Reuters) - DoorDash Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Finland-based rival Wolt Enterprises OY in an all-stock deal valued at about 7 billion euros ($8.09 billion), as the biggest U.S. food delivery firm expands into Europe.
A pandemic-driven boom in demand for services offered by DoorDash and rivals is expected to ease in the coming months, but with most companies still losing money while seeking scale, the stage is set for a wave of consolidation.
DoorDash's deal would be one of the biggest yet in the space following Just Eat Takeaway.com $7.3 billion acquisition of American rival Grubhub and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Inc's $2.65 billion deal for Postmates Inc last year.
DoorDash's shares surged nearly 19% in after-market trading on the acquisition that helps the company enter 22 additional markets, including Germany, Serbia, Croatia, Denmark and Sweden, as well as a beat on third-quarter revenue.
Analysts have said DoorDash had been gearing up to launch in Germany and Mexico for some time now.
Wolt, since its first delivery in Helsinki, Finland, in 2015, has grown to expand in Europe and Asia and has over 30,000 restaurant and retail partners.
The company had more than 2.5 million monthly active users, as of Sept. 30, while DoorDash exited third quarter with over 9 million members using its subscription service.
""Joining forces with Wolt will ... allow us to accelerate our international growth, while elevating our focus on the U.S.,"" DoorDash Chief Executive Tony Xu said in a statement.
The deal would allow DoorDash ""to play for a bigger prize on an even larger global stage"", he said on an earnings call. 
Wolt and DoorDash said they expect combined adjusted core earnings to be between breakeven and $500 million in 2022, with the deal expected to close in the first half of next year.
Nearly two-thirds of Wolt's gross order value, a metric totaling value of all orders and subscription fees, brings in positive contribution profit, DoorDash said, adding it would not share further details.
DoorDash equity issued as part of the deal will be valued at $206.45 per share, the companies said.
Separately, DoorDash said third-quarter revenue rose 45% to $1.28 billion, topping estimates of $1.18 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday, ending a multi-day rally of consecutive record closing highs as profit-taking and worries over ongoing inflation fueled a broad sell-off. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground, marking the conclusion of an eight-session streak of all-time closing highs set by the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
After such a run, and in the absence of market-moving catalysts, market participants appeared primed to take profits.
""We've had an incredible run, so letting some air out of the balloon is perfectly normal,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""It's a reminder that stocks can’t go up every day,"" Detrick added. ""We’re seeing some oversold weakness today, nothing overly concerning.""
The Labor Department's producer prices (PPI) report showed inflation continues to gather heat as ongoing goods and labor supply challenges send price growth further beyond the U.S. Federal Reserve's average annual 2% inflation target. 
Wednesday's CPI report will be scrutinized for clues regarding the extent to which producer prices are being passed along to the consumer, whose spending represents about 70% of the U.S. economy. 
(Graphic: Inflation: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnekkokvl/inflation.png) 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 112.24 points, or 0.31%, to 36,319.98, the S&P 500 lost 16.45 points, or 0.35%, to 4,685.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 95.81 points, or 0.6%, to 15,886.54.
Five of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session red, with consumer discretionary shedding 1.4%, the largest percentage drop. Utilities led the gainers, advancing 0.4%.
  The finish line for third-quarter earnings season is in sight, with 445 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 81% have beat consensus, according to Refinitiv.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co surged 2.6% following the 129-year-old industrial conglomerate's announcement that it would split into three separate public companies to simplify its business.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc plunged 12.0%, weighing on the consumer discretionary sector and extending its losses after Chief Executive Elon Musk's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll proposing to sell a tenth of his holdings garnered a 57.9% vote in favor of the sale. This raised questions as to whether Musk violated a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Online retail stock-trading app  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) reported a security breach affecting about 5 million customers, sending its shares sliding dropped 3.4%.
On the plus side, upbeat quarterly results sent video game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) Inc jumping 9.4% and shares of homebuilder D.R. Horton up 5.2%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 73 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.02 billion shares, compared with the 10.76 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Therefore, fundamentally sound semiconductor companies Wolfspeed (WOLF), Silicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB), SiTime (SITM), and MaxLinear (MXL), whose shares have soared in price over the past month, could continue rallying. Read on for details.Even though the current semiconductor chip shortage affects several industries worldwide, the semiconductor industry witnessed 27.6% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter. And although the industry is facing production logjams, increasing corporate investments and efforts made by governments to address this shortage should help it achieve a solid production rebound.
Also, technological breakthroughs, such as manufacturing chips that use a 3 nm process that consumes low power and offers low latency and better performance, should drive the industry’s growth. Investor interest in this space is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 22.6% gains over the past month. The global semiconductor market is expected to grow at a 7.7% CAGR to $778 billion by 2026.
Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally sound semiconductor stocks Wolfspeed, Inc. (WOLF), Silicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB), SiTime Corporation (NASDAQ:SITM), and MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL), which have rallied by more than 35% in price over the past month, should continue advancing. Therefore, we think these stocks could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now.

So, established real estate services companies RE/MAX (RMAX) and Realogy (RLGY) should prosper for the foreseeable future. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. (RMAX) operates internationally as a franchisor of real estate and mortgage brokerage services. The Denver, Colo.-based concern operates through three segments: Real Estate; Mortgage; and Marketing Funds. In comparison, Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) provides residential real estate services through its subsidiaries. It operates through three segments: Realogy Franchise Group (NASDAQ:FRG); Realogy Brokerage Group; and Realogy Title Group. RLGY is based in Madison, N.J.
The continuing low-interest-rate environment and peoples' desire to move to improved living spaces have driven increased demand for real estate services over the past year. Furthermore, as travel restrictions are lifted on approximately 33 countries for vaccinated visitors, wealthy buyers from overseas are expected to descend on United States luxury housing markets, which could generate tens of billions of dollars in added sales. According to a SpendEdge report, the real estate agents and brokerage services market is expected to grow at a 4.8% CAGR by 2024. Therefore, both RMAX and RLGY should benefit.
RMAX shares have gained 0.9% in price over the past month, while RLGY's delivered negative returns. However, RLGY’s 41.7% gains over the past year are significantly higher than RMAX’s 0.5% returns.

On the other hand, high growth stocks such as ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Ovintiv Inc. (NYSE:OVV), and ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON) offer the potential for strong gains with more reasonable volatility.When we started the year, it was cyclical stocks that were all the rage. Why not? The economy was bouncing back, and companies that thrive in that type of environment saw their share prices rise. However, growth stocks have come back in favor over the past few weeks. In fact, the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Growth ETF (RPG) is up 14.9% since October 4th. That compares extremely favorably to the S&P 500's 8.9% gain. 
Bitcoin has also gotten investors' attention this year as it has reached new record highs. But Bitcoin is also more volatile than many growth stocks. Looking at its price, Bitcoin peaked earlier this year at $63,229.04 in April, only to fall to $29,796.15 in July.
That's a pretty significant drop. While the cryptocurrency managed to rebound and hit new highs, that kind of volatility is best suited for a side trading account, not your primary portfolio. If you're looking for the potential for strong performance but with a reasonable amount of volatility, then high growth stocks such as ArcelorMittal (MT), Ovintiv Inc.

Shares in Poshmark, which went public in January, fell 27% in extended trading, as it also missed third-quarter revenue estimates a day after rivals ThredUp Inc and RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) beat expectations.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched a privacy update in April, preventing advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent, sparking an uproar from major social-media companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which have warned of a prolonged hit from the changes.
Meta-owned Facebook has said the change would impede businesses' ability to cost-effectively target local customers with advertisements.
Poshmark said it was spending more on marketing, directing funds toward TV advertisements and partnering with social media influencers to counter the impact of Apple's privacy changes. 
The increased expenditure, however, has led Poshmark to report a third-quarter loss of 9 cents per share, bigger than analysts' estimates of a loss of 7 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company's downbeat results come amid intensifying competition among resale platforms looking to attract shoppers turning to secondhand apparel as traditional retailers face shortages of new clothing.
ThredUp, which went public in March, forecast fourth-quarter revenue above estimates and said it was lowering prices to attract customers at a time clothing retailers have been increasing rates to counter surging costs and supply bottlenecks.

Poshmark forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $80 million to $82 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $85.2 million,
Poshmark said third-quarter revenue rose 16% to $79.7 million, missing analysts' average estimate of $82.7 million.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:56PM ET</span>",Commerce's Raimondo on how the U.S. will spend $65 billion on broadband,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Tuesday detailed plans to spend $65 billion to expand broadband access and affordability, a significant part of the Biden administration's new infrastructure bill.
The bill's authors say 19 million Americans lack access to high-speed internet. Raimondo said the administration's goal is for ""every single American"" to have access to high-speed affordable broadband, ""which means truly affordable."" 
The bill includes $42.45 billion in grants for expanding physical access to broadband, including building fiber or other networks.
The bill automatically awards $100 million to each state that can be used for technical assistance, to build out a state broadband office or other efforts, for a total of $5 billion. 
The rest of the $42 billion will be allocated by Raimondo's agency to states using a formula-based grant program, and all recipients of funding must offer a low-cost plan.
""Show us a plan that guarantees every single person in your state has access to high-speed affordable internet,"" Raimondo said. Projects must meet a minimum speed requirement of 100/20 megabits per second. 
She said it will take some months to get money to states and that it will come only after states submit plans that are approved by the department.
All recipients must offer a low-cost plan and states must address all of their unserved areas before they are able to fund deployment projects in underserved areas. ""We have to make sure we don't spend this money overbuilding,"" Raimondo said. 
She stressed that Americans would not see this spending right away in their communities. ""We want to get this right. It's more important to get this right than to rush.... Not everybody's going to have broadband a year from now.""
Biden initially proposed $100 billion for broadband and the White House conceded in May https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-would-back-smaller-broadband-internet-boost-2021-05-21/#:~:text=President%20Joe%20Biden%20in%20April%20called%20for%20%24100,said%20Friday%20in%20a%20memo%20to%20Senate%20Republicans that with $65 billion, it would take longer to extend access to all Americans.
AT&T (NYSE:T) CEO John Stankey said the government funds will pave the way ""for universal connectivity to unserved areas, making broadband affordable for low-income households, and providing more resources for digital equity and adoption."" 
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) said the funding appropriately focuses ""on getting broadband infrastructure first to areas where it does not currently exist, while at the same time continuing to promote faster speeds and disincentivizing duplicative projects.""
MORE AFFORDABLE BROADBAND 
The new infrastructure bill also includes $14.2 billion for the Federal Communications Commission to provide a new permanent $30 per month voucher for low-income families to use toward any internet service plan of their choosing. 
It expands on a $3.2 billion temporary COVID-19 pandemic program called the Emergency Broadband Benefit that is currently used by nearly 7.4 million U.S. households and provides a $50-a- month subsidy. The new program expands eligibility to more low-income households.

Minority and low-income households are less likely to have home internet, a Pew Research survey this year found. Fewer than 60% of adults with annual household income under $30,000 have home internet, according to the survey. 
As the government spends the billions funded in the bill, Raimondo vowed it would be transparent. ""Every single state plan is going to have to be put online, so you can comb through every detail of every plan,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares posted their worst daily fall in 14 months on Tuesday as investors dumped the high-flying stock ahead of a possible stake sale by company chief Elon Musk.
Nearly $200 billion in market capitalization was wiped off from Tesla as Musk's potential sales of his $17 billion stake triggered concerns about the stock's valuation following a flurry of stock sales by some board members. 
The rout comes after Musk asked his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers over the weekend if he should sell 10% of his stake in the company as Washington proposes to hike taxes for the super-wealthy. Nearly 58% said they would support such a sale.
Musk could time the proposed sale to coincide with a federal tax bill of nearly $11 billion that would be triggered by exercising a chunk of his Tesla stock options, worth $26.6 billion as of Monday's close. 
After the sharp run-up in Tesla's shares, ""Musk has used the now moot political debate on billionaire taxes as an opportunity to monetize billions of his wealth without reflecting a negative view on the company or its share price,"" wrote Michael O'Rourke, of Jones Trading, in a note late on Monday. 
""It is highly unlikely that there are institutional buyers for Tesla shares at current prices.""
The shares are up nearly 50%% year-to-date after hitting a series of record highs, triggered by a large order for Tesla cars placed by rental car company Hertz. 
The electric-car maker's shares ended down 12% at $1,023.50 on Tuesday, the biggest daily percentage drop since early September last year. They shed $138 billion in market capitalization, far more than the total market value of Ford Motor (NYSE:F), in addition to losing nearly $60 billion on Monday.
About $62 billion worth of Tesla shares changed hands on Tuesday, sharply up from $39 billion on Monday.
“We do feel the stock has moved up substantially in the short term and is probably over-valued by about 20 percent so... for long term investors this isn’t a bad time to rebalance by any means,"" Tesla bull Ross Gerber said on Monday.
BOARD MEMBERS SELL $1 BLN IN SHARES
Four former and current Tesla board members, including Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, filed to sell nearly $1 billion worth of shares since Tesla's market value surpassed $1 trillion late last month, according to filings and market data.
Kimbal Musk on Friday filed to sell 88,500 Tesla shares worth $109 million, a day before Elon Musk tweeted about his 10% stake. 
“The Big Short” investor Michael Burry noted “the tax-free cash he took out in the form of personal loans backed by 88.3 million of his shares,” Business Insider reported, citing his tweet on Musk's stake sale. 
Billionaires have been criticized for borrowing against their stock without selling the stock and paying capital gains tax on the appreciation. 
Burry's office and Tesla were not immediately available for comment.
While the stock sale could solve a major tax headache for Musk, his tweets raised questions about potential violation of his settlement with the U.S. securities regulator.He was fined $20 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for tweets in 2018 and was required to step down as chairman. 
Investors will closely watch SEC filings from Tesla for any details on Musk's plans. SEC rules give companies four working days to report major events.

Meanwhile, rival electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc is poised to price its roughly $10 billion initial public offering later on Tuesday.
Backed by both Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Ford Motor Co , Rivian last Friday boosted its offering's price range as investors bet on the company to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:28PM ET</span>",Facebook plans to remove thousands of sensitive ad-targeting options,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it plans to remove detailed ad-targeting options that refer to ""sensitive"" topics, such as ads based on interactions with content around race, health, religious practices, political beliefs or sexual orientation.
The company, which recently changed its name to Meta https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebooks-zuckerberg-kicks-off-its-virtual-reality-event-with-metaverse-vision-2021-10-28 and which makes the vast majority of its revenue through digital advertising, has been under intense scrutiny over its ad-targeting abilities and rules in recent years.
In a blog post, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gave examples of targeting categories that would no longer be allowed on its platforms, such as ""Lung cancer awareness,"" ""World Diabetes Day"", ""LGBT culture"", ""Jewish holidays"" or political beliefs and social issues. It said the change would take place starting Jan. 19, 2022. 
The company has been hit with criticisms around its micro-targeting capabilities, including over abuses such as advertisers discriminating against or targeting vulnerable groups. In 2019, it agreed to make changes to its ads platform as part of a settlement over housing discrimination issues.
""We've heard concerns from experts that targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Mudd, the company's vice president of product marketing for ads, in the post. 
Its tailored ad abilities are used by wide-ranging advertisers, including political campaigns and social issue groups as well as businesses. 
""The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations,"" Mudd said in the post, adding some advertising partners were concerned they would not be able to use these adds to generate positive social change. 
Advertisers on Facebook's platforms can still target audiences by location, use their own customer lists, reach custom audiences who have engaged with their content and send ads to people with similar characteristics to those users.
The move marks a key shift for the company's approach to social and political advertising, though it is not expected to have major financial implications. CEO Mark Zuckerberg estimated in 2019, for example, that politicians' ads would make up less than 0.5% of Facebook's 2020 revenue. 
The issue of political advertising on social media platforms, including whether the content of politicians' ads should be fact-checked, provoked much debate among the public, lawmakers and companies around the U.S. presidential election. 

 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) in 2019 banned political ads altogether, but Facebook had previously said it would not limit how political advertisers reached potential voters. 
Facebook, which now allows users to opt to see fewer ads related to topics like politics and alcohol, said on Tuesday it would early next year give people more controls over the ads they see, including ones about gambling and weight loss.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:28PM ET</span>",Stocks close below record amid U.S. inflation worries; oil climbs,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - World stock indexes slid on Tuesday, bringing a multi-day rally of record closing highs to a wrap as profit-taking and worries over ongoing inflation fueled a broad selloff. 
The retreat came as a solid rise in producer prices last month deepened concerns over inflation and oil prices have soared to seven-year highs, driving up the U.S. retail gasoline cost to $3.42 a gallon, the highest in seven years. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields edged lower.
After the U.S. Labor Department said producer prices increased solidly in October, investors heavily bought government-backed debt obligations. The data indicated that high inflation, which has become a bigger concern for investors than the COVID-19 crisis, could persist as supplies remain tight.
Wednesday's CPI report will be scrutinized for clues regarding the extent to which producer prices are being passed along to the consumer, whose spending represents about 70% of the U.S. economy.
Oil prices rose to a two-week high on Tuesday after the United States lifted travel restrictions and other signs of a global post-pandemic recovery boosted the demand outlook, while supply remained tight. 
U.S. crude was recently up 3.11% at $84.48 per barrel and Brent was at $85.04, up 1.93% on the day.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.19% while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.23% after coming within a point of uncharted highs earlier in the session.
Global equities had hovered near all-time highs as investors weighed strong earnings, easing travel curbs and U.S. infrastructure spending against inflation risk that may lead to tighter monetary policy.
""Markets have risen fast and strong, there's been a vigorous rebound but the catalyst provided by the third-quarter earnings season is coming to an end,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Cau noted that market positioning was far from extreme and that many investors remained prudent despite no imminent threat to the rally.
He argued it was ""healthy"" to see markets pause to digest upbeat corporate earnings and news that major central bankers were in no rush to raise interest rates.
Fears of a sudden tightening of monetary policy sparked a fixed-income selloff in October but government bond yields have since turned lower.
""Central bank pushback against early tightening supports a pro-risk stance,"" JP Morgan analysts told clients in a note.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31% and the S&P 500 lost 0.35%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6%.
The yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities dipped as low as -1.21%, the lowest since early August, and the yield on 30-year TIPS touched a record low of -0.592%
The benchmark 10-year yield was last down 5.8 basis points to 1.439%. The yield on the 30-year bond reached as low as 1.795%, the lowest since July, and was last down 6.9 basis points to 1.819%. 
Yields for both the U.S. and the euro zone benchmark are trading close to one-month lows. 
""The headline inflation numbers we're getting monthly, it's no longer a phenomenon for investment professionals, now it's hitting the mainstream,"" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy for WisdomTree.
Market analysts awaited Wednesday's U.S. consumer prices data. A stronger-than-expected reading would rekindle talk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates sooner than expected.
The dollar index fell 0.094%, with the euro up 0.08% to $1.1595.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.33% versus the greenback at 112.86 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.356, down 0.01% on the day. 
Oil prices rallied as the passage of the U.S. infrastructure bill and China's export growth supported the outlook for energy demand.
Saudi Arabia's state-owned producer, Aramco (SE:2222), also raised the official selling price for its crude.

Gold prices climbed to their highest level since early September in tandem with a softer dollar ahead of U.S. inflation data due out later in the week. 
Spot gold added 0.4% to $1,831.53 an ounce.

However, its price is rebounding on rising demand for the metal. And the passage of a bi-partisan infrastructure bill by Congress this week could boost the industrial demand for this metal. Given the favorable price trends, we think silver stocks Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) and Silvercorp Metals (NYSE:SVM) might be ideal additions to one’s portfolio now. So, let’s evaluate these companies.Silver prices were trading at their highest levels earlier this year due to a Reddit-induced rally. However, prices declined to settle at $21.485 in September, their lowest level since July 2020, on indications of a forthcoming tightening of central bank monetary policy.
Analysts expect the metal’s demand to climb 15% globally this year to 1.03 billion ounces. Given silver’s heavy industrial usage and rebounding industrial activities, spot silver prices have bounced back to settle at $24.45 per ounce. The rally was driven by the passage of the b-partisan infrastructure bill this week, which is expected to bolster the demand for silver for electrical grids, WiFi, and electric vehicle charging stations. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) ETF has gained 8.1% over the past month versus the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 7.1% returns.
Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally strong silver stocks  Pan American Silver Corp . (PAAS) and  Silvercorp Metals Inc . (SVM) could be ideal bets now.

Line 5 is at the center of a long-running environmental dispute between Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge and the state of Michigan that has embroiled the Canadian and U.S. governments.
""We expect that both the U.S. and Canada will engage constructively in those negotiations,"" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 
She said those discussions should not be viewed as an indicator that the U.S. government was considering shutting down the pipeline. 
""That is something that we're not going to do,"" she said.
The Line 5 pipeline ships 540,000 barrels per day of crude and refined products between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, via Michigan, and is a key link in Enbridge's Mainline network, which transports the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered Enbridge to stop operating the pipeline by May because of concerns a section running underwater in the Straits of Mackinac could leak into the Great Lakes. The company ignored that order and the two sides are in a legal battle over Line 5's fate.
Last month, the Canadian government, which backs Enbridge, escalated the dispute by invoking the decades-old pipeline treaty with the United States to trigger negotiations.

""Line 5 is a top priority for Canada,"" said Lama Khodr, a spokesperson for Canada's foreign ministry. ""Canada's objective remains to work with the U.S. in these formal treaty negotiations to seek a solution where Line 5 remains open and operating safely.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped its eight-day winning streak Tuesday, as investors eased their bullish bets amid a Tesla-fueled slump in consumer discretionary stocks and weakness in financials as U.S. Treasury yields slid.
The S&P 500 fell 0.36%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.31%, or 112 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.60%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 12%, adding to its 10% slump from Monday as investors anticipate that CEO Elon Musk will offload 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker after followers backed the move in a recent twitter poll.
General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) also dragged the sector deeper into the red.
Financials were weighed down by weakness in banking stocks amid a fall in U.S. bond yields following signs of slowing producer inflation.
Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were down more than 1%.
The producer price index, or wholesale inflation rose 0.5% in September, missing expectations for a 0.6% gain expected. But core ppi inflation fell short of estimates.
“Core goods inflation, however, looks to be peaking […] this is not definitive, yet, but it is encouraging, at the margin,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a mote.
Energy shrugged off rising oil prices as investors seemingly took some profit on run-up in the Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN).
Industrials outperformed the broader market following a 2% climb in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) after the conglomerate outlined plans to split into three business.
GE will split its business into health care, energy, and aviation, but would eventually focus on the latter amid plans to sell health care and energy in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
The earnings front, meanwhile, offered mixed results from corporates.
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) fell 12% after the payments company reported mixed third-quarter results, with a miss on revenue estimates, while guidance also disappointed.
The quarterly results drew a slew of negative reactions from Wall Street analysts, with Morgan Stanley cutting its price target on the stock to $265 from $340, but kept its overweight rating.
 ""PayPal is being adversely impacted from hangover impacts of the pandemic, [which is] creating a bigger drag on growth than we had previously anticipated, negatively impacting our ’22 estimates,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) slumped more than 9% despite reporting third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.
Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), meanwhile, was one of the standout performers, rising 42% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 results underpinned by stronger user activity despite the easing of pandemic restrictions and back-to-school seasonality.
In other news, speculation over whether Jerome Powell will retain his position as Federal Reserve Chairman intensified following a Bloomberg report that President Joe Biden had interviewed Fed Governor Lael Brainard as a possible candidate for the top job."

OTTAWA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden is planning to host an in-person meeting with the leaders of Mexico and Canada on Nov. 18, the first of its kind in more than five years, a source in Ottawa said on Tuesday.
Three other people familiar with the matter had said final details were still being worked out but if the meeting goes ahead it would most likely be some time next week in Washington.
Sources based in Ottawa and Mexico City requested anonymity because the plans were not yet public.
Biden has held virtual meetings with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since taking office this year, and attended the G20 in Rome with Trudeau. The in-person summit coincides with policy tensions over immigration, energy and trade.
Immigration on the U.S. southern border with Mexico has reached record levels, and Mexico wants the U.S. https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-warns-migration-will-not-slow-without-more-us-investment-central-america-2021-10-13 to invest more to stem it. 
As well as immigration, the agenda will cover fighting COVID-19 and competitiveness, the Ottawa source said.
The leaders of the three countries started holding what is informally known as the Three Amigos summit in 2005 and met most years until 2016 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-canada-mexico/adios-three-amigos-obama-heads-to-last-summit-with-canada-mexico-idUSKCN0ZD0NU. The practice ended when U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.
The countries are bound together by the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement that governs https://www.reuters.com/business/us-trade-chief-tai-urges-canada-mexico-enforce-new-north-american-trade-deal-2021-05-18 some $1.5 trillion in North American trade annually.
Trudeau welcomed Biden's election win a year ago but since then a series of old trade disputes over lumber, pipelines and procurement have flared up. 
Canada is also unhappy about proposed U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles and says if they are introduced, it would respond appropriately. Ottawa says the move could harm the highly-integrated continental auto industry.

In July, Canada and United States expressed concern about Mexican energy policies.
The White House and Trudeau's office declined comment. The office Lopez Obrador did not respond to requests for comment.

Meta said the topics include referencing causes, organizations, or public figures related to health, race or ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, or sexual orientation. 
""The decision to remove these Detailed Targeting options was not easy and we know this change may negatively impact some businesses and organizations. Some of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change, while others understand the decision to remove them,"" said Graham Mudd, VP Product Marketing, Ads.

The legislation, introduced by Representatives Ken Buck, a Republican, and David Cicilline, a Democrat, and others, would require big internet platforms to show consumers information not directed to them via algorithms, putting them outside what the lawmakers called the ""filter bubble.""
Cicilline is chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, and Buck is the top Republican. The panel wrote a big report unveiled last year that sharply criticized big tech companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The House measure is a companion to a bill introduced in the Senate in June. That one is also bipartisan.
""Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data,"" Buck said in a statement.

There is also a raft of antitrust legislation aimed at the big tech platforms.

 General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) jumped after announcing a plan to split itself in three, adding an element of surprise to Tuesday’s session.
So far, strong earnings and the ongoing business reopening have lifted indexes to all time peaks. On Monday, the U.S. opened its borders to air travelers from 33 countries, also boosting sentiment on the travel and leisure sectors.
The Labor Department's producer prices data showed rising prices, which has replaced the pandemic as a main source of concern in the markets and could linger for a while. On Wednesday, we get data on consumer prices for October, another key benchmark.
In single stock news, GE rose nearly 4% on the plan to divide itself.  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD), the mobile investing app, fell nearly 3% after saying late Monday it was the target of a security breach.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s fourth-quarter profit per share is seen coming in at 51 cents on revenue of $18.82 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts will be eager to hear about the recovery of its theme parks business and progress in its streaming operations.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",From Edison to Welch to Culp: the rise and fall of GE,"(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), whose innovations range from X-ray machines and fluorescent lamps to television broadcasting, on Tuesday announced its plans to split into three public companies.
Here is a timeline of the key events in GE's history:
** In 1890, Thomas Alva Edison, inventor of the light bulb, established the Edison General Electric Co, which later merged with a rival to form the General Electric Co.
** In 1896, GE became one of the 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average.
** In 1941, GE built the first U.S. jet engine, the I-A, that was used next year to power America's first jet aircraft for military use. Eventually, 100,000 GE turbo superchargers were used by the U.S. military in aircraft during World War II.
** In 1957, GE supplied power to nearly 120,000 customers from the world's first commercial nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.
** Jack Welch took over as CEO of GE in 1981 and led the company for over 20 years. Welch renamed the company ""GE"". He died in 2020.
** Jeffrey Immelt took over GE's reins on Sept. 7, 2001 - days before the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington triggered a long slump in the key aviation market.
** Immelt stepped down https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-ceo-flannery-idUSKBN1931W3 as CEO after 16 years and was succeeded by GE Healthcare unit's head John Flannery in August 2017. 
** The company gets bumped out of the Dow Jones index in June 2018.
** Flannery was ousted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-ceo-idUSKCN1MB2CY in October 2018 due to the slow pace of GE's turnaround and a massive $23 billion write down in its power division. He was replaced by Larry Culp.
** In October 2018, Culp took his first step https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-results-idUSKCN1N41BJ in reviving the conglomerate as it slashed its dividend to a penny from 12 cents to preserve cash. 
** GE, in January 2019, said it would combine https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-renewable-energy-idUSKCN1PO1QP its battery storage and electrical grid units into its wind turbine and hydropower business to cut costs.
** A month later, GE said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-divestiture-danaher-idUSKCN1QE1GY it planned to offload its biopharma business to Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion in the biggest strategy reversal under Culp.
** In signs that Culp's turnaround strategy was working, GE lifted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-results-idUSKCN1UQ19S its full-year profit forecast in July 2019 and said it might generate as much as $1 billion in free cash flow. 
** A year later, COVID-19 pandemic hit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-general-electric-results-idUSKCN24U1JT GE's finances resulting in a wider-than-expected quarterly loss in 2020. Its aviation unit, the most profitable and most cash-generative business segment, registered the steepest fall in sales and orders.
** In March 2021, Culp outlined plans to divest GE's leasing business to Ireland's AerCap in an over $30 billion deal, in a move to reduce debt and focus on GE's industrial core of power, renewable energy, aviation and healthcare.

** On Nov.9, Culp brings GE's conglomerate era to an end with a plan to split it into three public companies that would focus on energy, healthcare and aviation.

Meanwhile, even though the S&P-500 continues to make new highs, silver is not making new lows relative to the S&P-500 and looks to be trying to bottom out currently. This is a reason to remain optimistic, as is the fact that silver continues to make higher lows vs. the gold price (GLD (NYSE:GLD)). Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Just over two months ago, we had concerning readings for the silver/gold ratio and the silver/S&P-500 ratio, with the latter in free fall and the former looking like it would make a new 1-year low and break below its key moving average. However, the bulls stepped up exactly where they needed to for silver, holding the critical $21.50/oz - $22.00/oz support zone and recently breaking out of a short-term downtrend. As the chart above shows, this allowed the silver/gold ratio to make a higher low relative to Q4 2020 levels, and it has also contributed to the silver/S&P-500 ratio not making a new low and continuing to hold above its 2018 lows, in the depths of that violent bear market. Generally, outperformance in silver vs. the gold price suggests that both metals remain healthy and that violent pullbacks should be treated as bull market corrections, not the start of new bear markets.

(Reuters) -Airbnb Inc on Tuesday announced a slew of new features including a translation tool to be launched later this year and expanded insurance for hosts, as easing COVID-19 curbs send more people to its home-rental app.
The features, aimed at facilitating rising cross-border travel and longer stays, will help Airbnb further capitalize on a pandemic-driven shift in consumer preference towards non-urban destinations and alternative accommodations.
""What you're going to see is as the world moves into a post COVID-19 world, people are going to travel a lot more than they did before, certainly a lot more than they do now,"" Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky told Reuters in an interview.
Chesky expects the new tool, which will be able to translate listing descriptions and reviews in 60 languages, to help in bookings, especially in Europe and Asia Pacific where there is high demand for cross-border travel.
Airbnb said more than 100,000 guests stayed on its rental properties for at least three straight months in the past year.
Its ""AirCover"" insurance will offer hosts protection against pet damage as global searches surge on its platform for pet-friendly listings. 
Truist analyst Naved Khan expects the latest upgrades to drive incremental growth at Airbnb. The brokerage maintains its ""hold"" rating on the stock.
Months of pent-up demand triggered a major spike in bookings to the United States on Monday, as the country lifted pandemic-driven travel curbs imposed in early 2020.

Overall cross-border travel has risen steadily to 33% of gross nights booked in the third quarter, compared with 27% in the second and 20% in the first quarter, Airbnb said. 
As of Nov. 8, the top destinations for inbound foreign travel to the United States include Los Angeles, Miami and New York, according to Airbnb.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 03:07PM ET</span>",GE investors hope split remedies years of lackluster performance,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s decision to break up into three separate companies, investors who have held the stock through a long, troubled period may be hoping the move will give the conglomerate's underperforming shares a jolt.
The 129-year-old industrial conglomerate announced on Tuesday it would split into three businesses focusing on aviation, energy and healthcare.
GE shares jumped as much as 7% after the announcement and hit their highest level since May 2018. The stock then pared its gains and was up about 3% in afternoon trade.
Once the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, GE's shares have grown steadily less relevant in the wider stock market for the past two decades.
Here is a closer look at GE in the markets:
In 2000, GE's market value hovered around $600 billion, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
But a number of struggles over the years - including the 2008 financial crisis that nearly bankrupted its most profitable business, GE Capital, and later a downturn in oil prices and issues with GE's power business - took a heavy toll. GE's market value stood at $119 billion on Monday. 
(Graphic: GE market value since 2000: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwnnbevo/Pasted%20image%201636477313794.png) 
While GE shares struggled, its market value was eclipsed by dozens of companies, particularly those in the information technology sector. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example, has become the largest U.S. company by market value today, while GE ranks around 80th. 
(Graphic: GE: Built for an earlier century?: https://graphics.reuters.com/GE-MARKETCAP/mopanllrkva/chart.png) 
Tuesday's decision to split up came under Chief Executive Larry Culp, an previous outsider to GE who was named to the top job three years ago to help restore the company.
Under Culp, GE's shares have continued to languish. Since he was named CEO, the stock had gained about 25% as of Monday, against a 61% rise for the overall S&P 500 and a 37% rise for the S&P 500 industrials sector. 
(Graphic: GE shares under CEO Larry Culp: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbpgnbbxyvq/Pasted%20image%201636477059178.png) 
GE faced skepticism from more than just stockholders. It is one of the corporate debt market's largest issuers with nearly $68 billion of outstanding bonds, and bondholders gave it just as cold a shoulder for most of the last decade. 
Before the financial crisis, it sported a ""triple A"" rating, but the long shadow of that episode has hung over its debt ever since. Its once-prized bonds fell so far from grace that a possible downgrade to below investment grade - or junk bond - status was a common concern as recently as 2018.
Its bonds have fared much better recently - especially since the Federal Reserve took extreme steps to calm markets in March 2020 in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, igniting a powerful rally in risky assets, including GE's bonds. 
(Graphic: GE bonds: From pariah to debt market darling: https://graphics.reuters.com/GE-DEBT/xmvjorrwzpr/chart.png) 

Whether the split is in fact the cure for GE shares remains to be seen. As it stands, GE shares have been trading at a more expensive valuation, based on price-to-earnings ratio, than those of industrial rivals.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 03:01PM ET</span>",Private equity industry asks how long the boom will last,"By Chibuike Oguh
BERLIN (Reuters) - Private equity dealmakers are descending on Berlin for their annual get-together, with their industry thriving and many of them wondering how long the good times will last.
Armed with billions of dollars, buyout firms have already taken advantage of what has been a record year for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), selling some of their assets for top dollar.
Private equity-backed M&A deals more than doubled to a record $818.4 billion in the first nine months of this year, up from $315.2 billion last year, according to Refinitiv. 
The S&P private equity index, meanwhile, is up 43% so far this year, compared with a 25% gain in the benchmark S&P 500.
Shares of the biggest private equity firms, including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc , and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES), have surged as the U.S. economy rebounded with the easing of coronavirus restrictions. 
The private equity industry's median internal rate of return was 33% as of March 2021, the highest on record, according to data provider Pitchbook.
Despite the looming threat of inflation, dealmakers expect the current pace of activity to continue, with hundreds of millions of dollars of management fees at stake for top industry executives. 
""We are certainly seeing some inflationary pressures combined with somewhat of an easing of the pandemic globally,"" Brian Bernasek, co-head of U.S. buyout and growth at Carlyle, told Reuters. ""We expect to see a continued robust environment, but with perhaps a bit less steam in the system.""
At the annual SuperReturn International conference, attention is also expected to focus on the labour shortage facing numerous U.S. businesses - a worrying sign for many private equity-owned companies. 
""People have been paid to stay home,"" said Michael Psaros, managing partner at KPS Capital, who says orders at his industrial companies are going unfulfilled despite surging demand. ""The impact is the opportunity cost or forgone profit."" 
While larger buyout deals have been few and far between this year, some private equity firms have banded together to acquire companies for huge sums, raising expectations that such so-called club deals could happen more often.
Most buyout firms typically assume sole control of companies and rarely team up.
But in June, Blackstone, Carlyle and Hellman & Friedman together agreed to buy medical supply and equipment company Medline Industries Inc for $34 billion, including debt.
On Monday, Advent International, Permira Advisers LLC, and Crosspoint Capital Partners agreed to jointly take the cyber security company private in a $14 billion deal.
Dealmakers say more such deals could occur, given the availability of capital, though some point to the industry's high levels of debt.

""The private equity market is generally more levered than the public market on a relative basis but with better matched return and duration,"" said Scott Graves, co-head of private equity at Ares Management.

(Reuters) -The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $465 million judgment against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in a lawsuit by the state alleging the drugmaker fueled the opioid epidemic through the deceptive marketing of painkillers.
The decision marked the latest setback for states and local governments pursuing lawsuits to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for a drug abuse crisis the U.S. government says led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades. 
The court ruled https://tmsnrt.rs/3bSrnrj that the state's public nuisance law does not extend to the manufacturing, marketing and sales of prescription opioids and that a trial judge went too far in holding the company liable under it.
""However grave the problem of opioid addition is in Oklahoma, public nuisance law does not provide a remedy for this harm,"" Justice James Winchester wrote.
New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based J&J in a statement said it sympathized with those affected by the epidemic but that the court ""appropriately and categorically rejected the misguided and unprecedented expansion of the public nuisance law.""
A spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor did not respond to requests for comment. His office had on appeal sought $9.3 billion from J&J to fund treatment and other programs to address the epidemic.
The Oklahoma lawsuit was the first of the more than 3,300 lawsuits over the opioid crisis against pharmaceutical manufacturers, drug distributors and pharmacies to go to trial.
The trial pre-dated an agreement this year by J&J and the three largest U.S. drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) - to pay up to $26 billion to settle thousands of opioid-related cases against them.
PUBLIC NUISANCE LAWS
Tuesday's decision came days after a similar trial in California pitting several large counties against J&J and three other drugmakers resulted in a tentative ruling in the companies' favor.
Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman ruled in August 2019 that J&J had engaged in misleading marketing about the benefits of painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, and concluded that their addictive risks caused a public nuisance.
J&J had argued that there was scientific support for the marketing claims and said that Duragesic and Nucynta accounted for a tiny fraction of the opioids sold in Oklahoma. 
The company, which no longer promotes the drugs, also argued the state's public nuisance law should not apply. 
In Tuesday's ruling, Winchester agreed that the law only applied to discrete, localized problems involving criminal or property-based conflicts, not policy problems.
""The district court's expansion of public nuisance law allows courts to manage public policy matters that should be dealt with by the legislative and executive branches,"" Winchester wrote.
Paul Geller, a plaintiffs' lawyer at the law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd who helped draft the $26 billion nationwide settlement proposal, said the Oklahoma ruling could lead to increased participation in the settlement.
""Perhaps the realization that, despite the gravity of the epidemic, trials are inherently risky and appellate courts are largely unpredictable will ultimately help increase participation,"" he said.
Eight states have declined to sign-onto the deal with J&J, which agreed to pay up to $5 billion. Local governments in states that did join the have until January to sign-on. The ultimate payout is contingent on participation.

The Oklahoma ruling, coupled with the California decision, could prompt states and localities who have not backed the proposed nationwide settlement to re-think their positions, said Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a University of Georgia law professor.
""To the extent folks are on the fence about going into that settlement, this definitely changes the risk profile,"" Burch said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen said on Tuesday it plans to build a new state-of-the-art car factory close to its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, hoping to raise its game as the opening of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s gigafactory near Berlin draws closer.
The plant, which still requires approval by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s supervisory board over the coming weeks, is part of the group's Trinity project under which the carmaker wants to build a flagship electric sedan in Wolfsburg from 2026.
Volkswagen, which gave no cost estimate for the factory, said it aimed for a production time of 10 hours per vehicle for the Trinity model, similar to how long it will take Tesla to assemble the Model 3 at its planned site in Gruenheide.
Constructing an all-new plant is an alternative to adapting the existing Wolfsburg plant to produce the Trinity model, which VW says would limit the possibilities for more radical changes to the manufacturing process.
""That's why we're planning greenfield construction: efficient and without limitations by existing structures,"" Volkswagen brand CEO Ralf Brandstaetter said in a statement.
""That way we are gaining time and space to gradually modernise the main factory in a far-reaching way and raise production there, too, to a new level.""
Volkswagen's Trinity model is aiming for a level 4 autonomous standard, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.
Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess has benchmarked Wolfsburg against Tesla's German site, expected to open later this year or early next, arguing that VW's main site was way behind in terms of efficiency and speed.

This has helped to escalate a conflict between Diess and labour representatives, who have accused the CEO of spreading fear by warning of major job cuts that a shift towards leaner faster production would entail.
Diess earlier on Tuesday said there were no plans for mass layoffs.

Meyer himself will directly invest in the Panera Bread owner at the time of the IPO, Panera Brands said on Tuesday, and become the lead independent director of the company's board.
Typically, special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) are shell firms raised with the intent of later merging with a private entity to take it public. In the case of Panera, Meyer's USHG Acquisition Corp will invest following the IPO.
After the listing, a unit of Panera Brands will merge with USHG Acquisition for $287.5 million and the proceeds will be invested in the restaurant chain owner. 
The IPO plan comes four years after European investment firm JAB Holdings took Panera private in a deal valued at about $7.5 billion, with the sandwich chain's return coming at a time when people are heading to restaurants again after months of ordering in during lockdowns.
Coffeehouse Dutch Bros Inc, donut chain Krispy Kreme and hot dog maker Portillo's Inc also went public this year. 

Shares of USHG Acquisition were up nearly 8%.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Industrie De Nora, which makes components to produce green hydrogen, has picked Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to work on plans to list in Milan, two sources said on Tuesday.
The initial public offering (IPO), which is planned for next spring, could value the Italian company at more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), one of the sources said.
Italian gas group Snam last year completed the acquisition of a 33% stake in De Nora, valuing it at around 1.2 billion euros including debt. Snam now holds 37%.
De Nora, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse declined comment.
The prospects for the green hydrogen market as a potential solution to reducing fossil fuel use and limit climate change had attracted investors looking for a company well-positioned in global clean energy, the sources said.
De Nora, which also operates in the water treatment sector, is a leading manufacturer of electrodes that are used in devices called electrolysers that generate carbon-free green hydrogen.
It also has 34% of an electrolyser joint venture with Germany's ThyssenKrupp which is involved in several large global hydrogen projects.
""That stake alone is worth more than 1 billion euros,"" the second source said.
As the energy transition gathers pace, Brussels is determined to give hydrogen a major role in helping to clean up economies and decarbonise areas hard to electrify, such as heavy transport and industry.

The electrode business accounts for 60% of De Nora's revenue which last year stood at 500 million euros. Core earnings, in a year marked by the COVID pandemic grew to 80.5 million euros.

Biden, a Democrat who has continued some of President Donald Trump's policies on China, said he would extend the restrictions laid out in his Republican predecessor's executive order of November 2020.
""The PRC is increasingly exploiting United States capital to resource and to enable the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses, which continues to allow the PRC to directly threaten the United States homeland and United States forces overseas,"" Biden said in a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The executive order was originally designed to deter U.S. investment firms, pension funds and others from buying shares of Chinese companies that were designated by the Department of Defense as backed by the Chinese military.
Biden in June made changes to what his team described as the ""legally flawed"" Trump-era order, tasking the Treasury Department with enforcing and updating on a “rolling basis” a new list of about 59 companies that replaced the earlier list from the Pentagon. 
U.S. entities are barred from buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, which include China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO). 
Biden's new list added about 10 publicly listed companies, but removed some other top names including Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading efforts to compete with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus, and two that challenged the ban in court - Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp. 
China hawks in Washington applauded Biden's extension of the policy, but took aim at the administration's failure to add new companies to the list since the June revisions.

“While we should applaud the extension of the ‘national emergency’... it’s hard to understand why not one Chinese company has been added to this modest capital markets sanctions list since the issuance of the Order on June 3,” said Roger Robinson, former chairman of the congressional U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. 
Biden said China's military-industrial complex, supported by its intelligence and other security, continues to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, paced by a Tesla-led slump in consumer discretionary stocks and weakness in financials as U.S. Treasury yields slipped following signs of slowing inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6%, or 228 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.7%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell nearly 11%, adding to its 10% slump from Monday as investors anticipate that CEO Elon Musk will offload 10% of his stake in the electric vehicle maker after followers backed the move in a recent twitter poll.
General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) also dragged the sector deeper into the red.
Financials were weighed down by weakness in banking stocks amid a fall in U.S. bond yields following signs of slowing producer inflation.
Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were down more than 1%.
The producer price index, or wholesale inflation rose 0.5% in September, missing expectations for a 0.6% gain expected. But core ppi inflation fell short of estimates.
“Core goods inflation, however, looks to be peaking […] this is not definitive, yet, but it is encouraging, at the margin,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a mote.

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) fell 12% after the payments company reported mixed third-quarter results, with a miss on revenue estimates, while guidance also disappointed.
The quarterly results drew a slew of negative reactions from Wall Street analysts, with Morgan Stanley cutting its price target on the stock to $265 from $340, but kept its overweight rating.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is creating a separate division for vaccines and antibody therapies, the drugmaker said on Tuesday, to focus on its COVID-19 shot and coronavirus treatments after a series of setbacks during the pandemic.
Reuters reported in July that the Anglo-Swedish company was exploring options for its vaccine business and expected to have greater clarity on the matter by the end of 2021. 
The new division, which will be led by executive vice-president of Europe and Canada, Iskra Reic, will combine research and development, manufacturing, as well as commercial and medical teams, a company spokesperson said.
""The team will be dedicated to our COVID-19 vaccine, our long-acting antibody combination and our developmental vaccine addressing multiple variants of concern, as well as to our existing portfolio for respiratory viral disease,"" the representative said.
The decision to set up a new business comes after a tumultuous 18 months for the drugmaker, which developed its COVID-19 vaccine in conjunction with the University of Oxford.
Production problems forced the company to cut deliveries to the European Union this year, prompting the bloc to launch a legal challenge that has now been settled.
Governments have also restricted its use among certain age groups due to links to rare blood clots. Regulators including the World Health Organization (WHO) have said, however, that the vaccine's overall benefits outweigh any risks.
AstraZeneca's application for U.S. approval of its shot is taking longer than expected too.
But positive results from trials of its antibody cocktail as a preventative shot against COVID-19 have given AstraZeneca a major boost, potentially positioning it as a supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The antibody treatment is currently under review by European regulators. 
BROADER MARKET?
The creation of the vaccines division, first reported by the Financial Times, indicates AstraZeneca sees a future for its COVID-19 shot beyond the pandemic but shouldn't be taken as a sign it is planning a full-scale entry into the broader vaccine market,  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said.
""That would require significant new research and development investment, and as yet we have no indication that this is forthcoming,"" he said.
AstraZeneca has pledged to supply vaccines at cost during the pandemic. The not-for-profit strategy and challenges with the shot had fuelled speculation about whether it would want to keep the business in the long term.
The company's COVID-19 shot is the biggest contributor to the COVAX vaccine sharing scheme backed by the WHO. 
""Vaccines is not a traditional area of strength (for AstraZeneca) ... but the new group structure suggests the company is looking to pull together certain operations across its portfolio to ensure they operate more effectively and more profitably,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. 

While AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine remained a drag on profits in the second quarter, sales of the shot more than tripled to $894 million from the first three months of the year, making it one of the drugmaker's best-selling products.
AstraZeneca is due to report third-quarter results on Friday.

The recent rally of education and training stock Meten Holding (METX) does not look sustainable given its weak fundamentals. However, Adtalem Global Education (NYSE:ATGE), Universal Technical Institute (NYSE:UTI), and Lincoln Educational Services (LINC) look well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds and perform better than METX.The pandemic has led to a significant shift in the formal education structure, switching to online modes from traditional classroom learning. In the United States, post-secondary degree attainment stood at 52% at the end of 2020, much higher than the OECD average of 45%. Furthermore, the global education and training services market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 9% starting this year, to reach $4.20 trillion by 2023.
Over the past month, Chinese Omnichannel English Language Training (ELT) service provider Meten Holding Group Ltd. (METX) has rallied 109.7%, after its strategic cooperation agreement with AGM Group Holdings Inc. (AGMH), for developing METX’s crypto mining business. However, the gains may be hard to sustain, given METX’s weak fundamentals. For the fiscal second quarter ended June 30, adjusted net loss came in at $11.73 million, while loss from operations stood at $12.01 million. Selling and marketing expenses increased 8.9% year-over-year to $11.95 million. Furthermore, Street expects its EPS to be negative $0.39 for the next year (fiscal 2022).
So, it could be wise to bet on education and training stocks Adtalem Global Education Inc. (ATGE), Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (UTI), and Lincoln Educational Services Corporation (LINC), which are better positioned to cash in on the industry’s growth and outperform METX.

E-retail sales as a share of total retail sales have increased substantially over the past year. Currently trading at a discount, the shares of Qurate Retail (QRTEA) should benefit from the industry tailwinds. However, considering the company missed its third-quarter earnings estimates, is QRTEA a Buy at the current price level? Let’s discuss.Qurate Retail, Inc. (QRTEA) is an Internet retail-based company engaged in video and online commerce in North America, Europe, and Asia. The Englewood, Colo.-based concern markets and sells various consumer products, primarily through live televised shopping programs, internet, and mobile applications. The stock gained 3.8% in price intraday to close yesterday’s trading session at $10.02, which was 31.5% below its 52-week high of $14.62. But QRTEA has slumped 18.1% over the past six months and is currently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Digital’s share of total retail sales has grown incrementally over the last year as people became more comfortable with online purchases amid stay-at-home restrictions. Also, with the economy’s reopening and increased consumer spending, both brick-and-mortar and online sales are expected to benefit from pent-up demand. E-commerce growth is projected to be 17.9% in 2021. However, the favorable industry trends were not reflected in QRTEA’s financials in its last reported quarter. For the third quarter, ended September 30, QRTEA reported $3.14 billion of revenue, representing a 7% decline year-over-year. Its adjusted net income declined 48% from the prior-year quarter to $123 million. In addition, its adjusted EPS decreased 46% year-over-year to $0.30, missing the $0.49 consensus estimate by 38.8%. David Rawlinson, President and CEO of QRTEA, stated, “Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are impacting our entire industry, and we have taken action to help mitigate the potential impacts.”
Retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. are expected to grow to 23.6% of all sales by 2025, representing a 13.7% change year-over-year, and its highest growth prediction yet. The industry trends and the company’s strategic plans and initiatives should enable the company to drive growth in the long run.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",French health authority advises against Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for under 30s,"PARIS (Reuters) -France's public health authority has recommended people under 30 be given  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine when available instead of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's Spikevax jab, which carried comparatively higher risks of heart-related problems.
The Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), which does not have legal power to ban or licence drugs but acts as an advisor to the French health sector, cited ""very rare"" risks linked to Myocarditis, a heart disease, that had shown up in recent data on the Moderna vaccine and in a French study published on Monday.
""Within the population aged under 30, this risk appears to be around five times lesser with Pfizer's Comirnaty jab compared to Moderna's Spikevax jab,"" HAS said in its opinion published on Monday. 
The decision in Paris came after regulators in several other countries, including Canada, Finland and Sweden, had also taken a more defensive stance on Spikevax over heart-related safety concerns affecting younger people.
The European Union's drug regulator EMA last month approved Moderna's booster vaccine for all age groups over 18, at least six months after the second dose.
The EMA earlier this year said that it had found a possible link between the very rare inflammatory heart condition and COVID-19 vaccines from both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines. 
However, according to the EMA, the benefits of both mRNA shots in preventing COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risks, the regulator said, echoing similar views expressed by U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization.

France's HAS said that its recommendation, which would apply regardless of the vaccine's use as a first, second or third ""booster"" dose, would be valid until more scientific findings on the matter are known. 
For persons aged over 30, however, the authority explicitly recommended the use of the Moderna vaccine, saying its effectiveness was slightly superior.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government will buy another $1 billion worth of the COVID-19 pill made by Merck & Co Inc and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, the companies said on Tuesday.
The government in June agreed to buy 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir for $1.2 billion and is now exercising options to buy 1.4 million more.
That brings the total secured courses to 3.1 million and worth $2.2 billion. Merck said the government has the right to buy 2 million more courses as part of the contract. 
The drug has been closely watched since data last month showed that when given early in the illness it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19.
""Molnupiravir, if authorized, will be among the vaccines and medicines available to fight COVID-19 as part of our collective efforts to bring this pandemic to an end,"" said Frank Clyburn, president of Merck's human health business.
President Joe Biden said on Friday that the United States had also secured millions of doses of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s rival antiviral drug, which was shown to cut by 89% the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease.
The Pfizer negotiations were for a deal similar to the one with Merck - 1.7 million courses of the treatment upfront with an additional option for 3.3 million, a senior U.S. health official said on Tuesday, confirming a New York Times report. 

Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Alfred Bourla said on Friday that the company plans to sell its treatment for around the same price for high-income countries as Merck, at roughly $700 for a course of therapy.
Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022.

Horton Inc posted a 65% rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, benefiting from record-high property prices as demand far outpaced supply that was crippled by raw material and labor shortages. 
Demand for housing remains strong as home buyers take advantage of low mortgage rates before the government raises them next year. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 3.14% last month, before coming down to 3.09% for the week ending Nov. 4, according to data from mortgage giant  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
""While mortgage rates fell after several weeks on the rise, we expect future upticks due to stronger economic data and as the Federal Reserve pulls back on its stimulus,"" said Sam Khater, mortgage company Freddie Mac's chief economist. 
Rising borrowing costs could make homeownership less affordable for some first-time buyers. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 3.97% in September 2019 before the pandemic. 
The top U.S. homebuilder said homes closed in the fourth quarter increased 8% to 21,937 homes compared to 20,248 units a year earlier. 
Net income attributable to the largest U.S. homebuilder rose to $1.33 billion, or $3.7 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $829 million, or $2.24 per share, a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates bank Mashreqbank PSC has agreed to pay $100 million in penalties to resolve a U.S. government probe into violations of sanctions against doing business with Sudan, regulators said on Tuesday.
Between January 2005 and February 2009, Mashreq sent $4 billion worth of Sudan-related payments through financial institutions in the United States, violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan, according to statements from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the U.S. Treasury Department. From 2009 through 2014, the bank's New York branch processed another $2.5 million in prohibited payments, DFS said.
The investigation found the bank instructed its employees to avoid disclosing certain information sent between banks to conceal the violations and avoid triggering alerts or freezes on the transactions, DFS said.
Mashreq said in an emailed statement the bank stopped the conduct ""of its own volition"" and had dedicated ""significant resources"" to boosting compliance policies and procedures.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the bank had provided ""substantial cooperation"" throughout the course of the investigation.
The Federal Reserve Board said in a separate statement it has issued a cease and desist order against the bank for having insufficient policies and procedures to ensure compliance with U.S. sanctions laws.

The United States imposed the sanctions in 1997 after Sudan was designated a state sponsor of terrorism, prohibiting financial institutions from conducting business with the government and some designated individuals and companies. 
Mashreq also agreed to report on the status and sustainability of the bank's compliance program.

(Reuters) - OneStream Software, which is backed by private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR), has hired advisers to help it prepare for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York that could value the software maker at over $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said.
Rochester, Michigan-based OneStream, which builds software tools and solutions designed for chief financial officers (CFOs) of companies, has tapped investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to lead preparations for a stock market launch that is expected to happen early next year, the sources said. 
Earlier this year, OneStream raised funding at a valuation of $6 billion from a group of investors including D1 Capital Partners and Tiger Global Management. At the time, OneStream indicated it planned to go public later.
The software firm is expected to nearly double its valuation at the time of its flotation in 2022, the sources said. 
The sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions were confidential, cautioned the timing and size of the deal were subject to market conditions and could change. 
Morgan Stanley and KKR declined to comment. OneStream did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
During the pandemic, demand for software tools built by companies such as OneStream boomed as companies accelerated digital transformations and sought tools that make forecasting and financial planning more efficient. 
OneStream said its annual recurring revenue (ARR), an important metric for software firms, doubled in the first half of 2021.

Launched in 2010, OneStream helps CFOs prepare and report financial statements to regulators and investors. On its website, the company says it also helps organizations with planning, budgeting and forecasting, among other things. 
Its prominent customers include  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp,  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD). KKR bought a majority stake in OneStream in 2019 at a valuation of over $1 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - Anne Perrot, an economist who has written in the past about the need for more regulation of Big Tech, is on the final short list to become France's new antitrust chief, three sources close to the matter said. 
The role is deemed strategic by Paris as it seeks to tame the dominance of U.S. tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), while the European Union considers new regulation of the sector, the sources said.
The French antitrust body is in the midst of probing the merger of France's two biggest private TV networks,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY)' TF1 and Bertelsmann's M6, in a very sensitive deal that would see the combined entity have sway over nearly three quarters of advertising on television and redefine the rules in the field. 
No final decision has been taken yet on the nomination, which may take several weeks to be finalised, the three sources said. The sources declined to say how many people were on the shortlist.
Perrot, 63, is a top civil servant at the French finance ministry. 
The Elysée declined to comment on what it called ""rumours"". Perrot and the finance ministry declined to comment.
Holding doctorates in economics and mathematics, Perrot has written several research papers on competition and large online tech firms, one of which, published last year, is entitled ""Digital platforms: regulating them before it's too late"". 
She also co-authored a report in 2019 that calls for European antitrust policy to be reformed to allow the emergence of European champions, something French President Emmanuel Macron has been pushing for since his election.
""It's important to have someone who has a new ideas about competition,"" a fourth source close to the French government said, speaking in general about the search for a new anti-trust chief. 

Perrot knows the French antitrust world well, having served as co-chair of the antitrust authority and having been part of a consultancy firm, Mapp, that specialises in competition matters. It was sold in 2018 to audit giant KPMG. 
In April 2017, she co-signed an op-ed in newspaper Le Monde calling on people to vote for Macron, a month before he was elected president.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 12:42PM ET</span>","U.S. credit card use returning to pre-pandemic patterns, NY Fed report finds","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - U.S. consumers are spending more and ramping up credit card balances, reversing a shift during the COVID-19 crisis, when they scaled back spending and substantially paid down debt, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report showed on Tuesday. 
After rising by $17 billion in both the second and third quarters, credit card use appears to be returning to pre-pandemic patterns, the researchers said. However, balances were still $123 billion lower than at the end of 2019, according to the quarterly report on household debt and credit.
""As pandemic relief efforts wind down, we are beginning to see the reversal of some of the credit card balance trends seen during the pandemic, namely reduced consumption and the paying down of balances,"" Donghoon Lee, a research officer at the New York Fed, said in a statement. ""At the same time, as pandemic restrictions are lifted and consumption normalizes, credit card usage and balances are resuming their pre-pandemic trends, although from lower levels.""
Credit cards typically follow a seasonal pattern, in which balances show ""modest"" increases in the second and third quarters, followed by a more substantial increase in the fourth quarter, researchers said. Consumers then usually reduce those balances in the first quarter as they pay off holiday spending, the report said. 
During the pandemic, however, households supported by direct cash payments and forbearance programs that paused payments on mortgages and student loans largely reduced their credit card debt. 
With forbearance programs winding down, some of those consumers may be able to use some of their available credit to make ends meet, the Fed researchers said. 
The report also found that total household debt increased by $286 billion in the third quarter to $15.24 trillion, driven mostly by a $230 billion increase in mortgage balances. Total debt balances are now $1.1 trillion above where they were at the end of 2019, the report showed. 
Auto debt increased by $28 billion in the third quarter and student loan balances grew by $14 billion. 
Originations of new mortgage loans, at $1.1 trillion, and auto loans, at $199 billion, both remained near series highs. Rising car prices contributed to the high volume for new auto loans by leading to a higher origination amount per loan, researchers said. The authors did not do a similar breakdown for mortgages but said rising home prices could be having a similar effect on mortgage debt. 

Lenders may be offering more credit to borrowers with lower credit scores after clamping down at the start of the pandemic, the report showed. For example, credit card issuance for lower credit score borrowers is back to pre-pandemic levels after declining at the start of the crisis. The median credit score for new mortgages and auto loans declined slightly in the third quarter, but was still high by historic standards, researchers said. 
The findings showed that consumer debt delinquencies remain low, thanks in part to forbearance programs and other federal aid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The aviation industry told the White House on Tuesday it will take ""significant time"" to ensure it is safe for major U.S. wireless companies to use C-Band spectrum for 5G communications.
In a letter sent to the White House, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), U.S. airlines, pilots and others said they need the Biden administration and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ""to help aviation and telecommunication industries reach acceptable mitigations.""
Last week, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) agreed to delay by a month the commercial launch of C-band wireless service from Dec. 5 until early January.
The Federal Aviation Administration issued a bulletin last week alerting manufacturers, operators and pilots that action may be needed to address potential interference with sensitive aircraft electronics caused by the 5G deployment.
The FAA said operators ""should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.""
The White House did not immediately comment but has been heavily involved in the issue - and even reviewed the FAA safety bulletin before it was cleared for release, officials said.
The letter said the aerospace industry would work to develop new standards, equipment, and aircraft/helicopter integration solutions but that they ""require more detailed knowledge of the C-Band deployment and will take significant time to ensure they meet the FAA’s robust safety requirements.""
The letter urged the White House to work with the FCC and FAA ""to convene a joint industry working group and continue to delay the deployment"" until air safety is assured.

The bulletin said ""there have not yet been proven reports of harmful interference due to wireless broadband operations internationally.""
Wireless trade group CTIA says 5G networks can safely use C-band spectrum ""without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,"" and cited numerous active 5G networks using this spectrum band in 40 countries.""

The boy, identified in a statement by Crump only as ""E.B.,"" sustained life-threatening injuries at a weekend performance headlined by hip-hop star Travis Scott that ended with eight people killed and dozens more injured in a stampede.
""This little boy is currently fighting for his life, and his parents will never know the same child they entered Astroworld with,"" Crump said in a statement https://twitter.com/BenCrumpLaw/status/1458109527119773696/photo/1 on Tuesday.
The lawsuit, which names Scott, Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), Scoremore Mgmt and Cactus (NYSE:WHD) Jack Records as defendants, alleges negligence in ""a great number of aspects"" including crowd control and failure to provide proper medical attention.
It also accuses the defendants of failing to stop the hip-hop star's performance ""until over 40 minutes"" after officials declared a mass casualty event had begun. 
Ezra Blount, 9, was on his father's shoulder at the event before falling during the crush, according to NBC News. 
Once the family was able to locate him at Texas Children's Hospital, the boy was in a coma to fight the brain trauma. 
""It's just a lot of things that could have prevented it,"" Taylor Blount, the nine-year-old's aunt, told NBC's ""Today"" show. 
Houston's police chief said he met briefly with Scott to voice his ""public safety concerns"" before the rapper took the stage. Friday's deadly crowd surge has led to a flurry of lawsuits on behalf of concert-goers, while police are pursing a criminal probe of the tragedy.
The eight https://www.reuters.com/world/us/eight-killed-texas-music-festival-stampede-include-college-high-school-students-2021-11-08fans who lost their lives ranged in age from 14 to 27 and included a high school baseball player, a high school band member who loved to dance and several college students from across the country.
The victims were crushed in a surge of fans near the stage at NRG Park at around 9:30 p.m., with some unable to breathe and others trampled underfoot. Hundreds of others in the sellout crowd of 50,000 were injured throughout the day.
Fans described a chaotic scene after a steady escalation of disruptive behavior over several hours.
Scott, who said he was ""devastated"" by the events, announced on Monday he would cover all funeral costs and offer aid to those affected. He is also working with law enforcement and city officials to ""respectfully and appropriately connect"" with victims and their families, according to a statement.
Canadian rapper Drake, who made an appearance at Astroworld with Scott, said in an Instagram statement https://www.instagram.com/p/CWCr3ydlVVA on Monday night his heart was ""broken for the families and friends of those who lost their lives and for anyone who is suffering."" 
More than a dozen lawsuits from victims and their families have already been filed against several defendants, including Scott and concert promoters  Live Nation Entertainment Inc  and ScoreMore. 

The lawsuits generally accuse Live Nation of acting negligently by failing to create and enforce sufficient safety protocols, failing to provide adequate security and failing to maintain proper crowd control.
Live Nation issued a statement on Monday saying the company ""would address all legal matters at the appropriate time."" Scott's representatives declined comment on civil suits filed.

So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist. Let’s evaluate.Ethereum or Ether is the world’s second-largest virtual currency by market capitalization and facilitates operations with the help of the Ethereum blockchain. Investors’ interest driving the cryptocurrency craze has helped Ethereum soar 552.6% year-to-date. It also hit its 52-week high of $4,831.59 today.
Recent reports show that the Ethereum network burned more Ether than it issued for at least a week (burning means that the ether is permanently removed from the circulating supply) after Ethereum’s London hard fork upgrade introduced a mechanism to burn a large portion of transaction fees, measured in ether, rather than sending them to miners. This is primarily responsible for the unprecedented surge in this digital currency. However, although the hash rate has increased, lower transaction fees could indicate lessening demand, and trading volume has also declined over the past few days.
On the other hand, the major U.S. stock market indexes notched up a round of records yesterday to start the second full week of trading in November. So, even though Ethereum has skyrocketed this year, Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC),  GameStop Corp . (NYSE:GME), and Avis Budget Group, Inc.

Revenues rose by 35% to 785 million euros ($907 million) in the first nine months of the year, mainly driven by strong growth in the United States in the last quarter. 
That was still down on the 994 million euros booked in the same period of 2019, before the pandemic hit. 
However, operating profit increased to 19 million euros in the third quarter, above pre-COVID levels. 
Analysts had expected revenue to rise by around 10% in the quarter, with a 16 million euros operating profit, according to a Refinitiv consensus. 
Most luxury groups have now surpassed pre-COVID levels. But Ferragamo was hit harder than most by the fallout from the coronavirus crisis last year and is still suffering from its high exposure to shops in airports and travel spending.
In addition, the health emergency broke out just as the family-owned firm was striving to revamp a brand famous for shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn. 

The Florentine group announced its new CEO in June in a bid to speed up its relaunch, following Gobbetti's success with Burberry's's turnaround.

Chief Executive Officer Linda Rendle said she’s committed to rebuilding the company’s margins after a turbulent 20 months of pandemic ups and downs, focusing on raising prices and holding down costs. 
“We’re controlling what we can control,” Rendle, who took the helm last September after 17 years at the firm, said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg News. At 43, she is the youngest female CEO of an S&P 500 company. 
Clorox has slumped from its pandemic-driven high, with shares trading higher than in 2019 but far below last year’s levels. Although well-known for disinfectant wipes and cleaning supplies, its brands are wide-ranging. Clorox also makes Burt’s Bees personal-care products, Brita filtered-water pitchers and Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing. 
Like many packaged-goods companies, Clorox is struggling with high commodity costs, labor shortages and supply-chain challenges. The Oakland, California-based company expects its gross margin, at 37% in the fiscal first quarter, to decline by 3 or 4 percentage points before beginning to expand again in the fourth quarter.
“We have every intention of restoring margins and we believe we can do it,” Rendle said. “I do see these things starting to ease as the global supply chain rights itself. Our mantra is to take every action that we can right now and we can always take additional action.”
To counter cost pressures, the company is increasing prices on 70% of its products this fiscal year -- on some of them, more than once. Rendle said she’s prepared to raise prices more if needed. “We do think this cost environment is more pervasive than was originally thought months ago,” she said.
Clorox capitalized early in the pandemic on consumers’ worries that the coronavirus spread easily on surfaces, which turned out not to be the case. Even so, Rendle said, the company’s customers are still cleaning more than they did pre-pandemic, with a more normal cold and flu season this winter likely to support use of wipes and sprays.

(Reuters) -European shares retreated from record highs on Tuesday, although strong corporate earnings and hopes of a recovery kept losses limited as investors awaited fresh cues from economic data due this week.
The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.2% lower at 482.71 points, holding just below its record peak hit last week. 
Insurers were among the biggest drags on continental European markets, falling 0.8%. German group Munich Re fell 2.5% after warning of more COVID-related losses in its reinsurance business.
British insurer Direct Line also slipped 4.2% after reporting lower-than-expected growth in quarterly premiums.
Bank stocks tracked declines in bond yields, while basic resources stocks shed 1.1%. 
 Renault  (PA:RENA) rose 3.8% to the top of France's CAC 40 after its Japanese partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) reported a quarterly profit and hiked its full-year forecast. 
The STOXX 600 had marked eight straight sessions of gains, with France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX breaching new records in the first week of this month on the back of strong corporate earnings and the European Central Bank's dovish stance. 
A survey showed investor sentiment in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, rose unexpectedly in November on hopes that inflation will ease next year and economic growth will pick up.
""The equity rally has been impressive,"" said Ankit Gheedia, head of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' equity and derivatives strategy for Europe.
""How long companies can keep profit margins elevated is going to be the key indicator for when the bull market is over, and, so far, all signs suggest profit margins should stay supported in the medium-term.""
Investors are now awaiting inflation data from the euro zone's largest economy, as well as industrial production data for the bloc, later in the week. 
Retail stocks were the best performers for the day, rising 1.2%, while declining bond yields helped real estate stocks gain 0.6%. 
Among gainers, German agriculture and pharmaceutical firm Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) climbed 1.5% after posting higher quarterly adjusted earnings that beat analysts' forecasts.
French supermarket group  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) rose 2.9% after pledging 3 billion euros between 2022 and 2026 for its digital push.

Wall Street stocks also retreated from recent highs, as caution kicked in ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data on Wednesday. While the Federal Reserve has already outlined plans to taper stimulus, a high inflation reading could prompt it to bring forward policy tightening. [.N]

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Amazon seeking to settle EU antitrust investigations, sources say","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeking to settle two EU antitrust investigations to stave off potential hefty fines and orders to change its business practices, people familiar with the matter said.
The European Commission in November last year charged the world's biggest online retailer with using its size, power and data to push its own products and gain an unfair advantage over rival merchants that sell on its online platform.
It also opened an investigation into Amazon's possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services. 
Amazon is engaged in preliminary discussions with the EU competition enforcer and has offered concessions to address their concerns, the people said. 
Settlement talks can take months to wrap up, with no guarantee that both sides will reach an agreement.
Amazon, however, may find a receptive ear in EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager compared to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google, which tried but failed to settle with her.
Vestager, who has taken a tough line with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as well, has cited Amazon's willingness in 2017 to offer concessions to settle an investigation into its distribution deals with e-book publishers in Europe, which she subsequently accepted.
An offer to settle gives a company an opportunity to take the edge off regulatory demands for changes to business practices seen as anti-competitive.
The Commission, which can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover, declined to comment. Based on last year's revenue, that could total around $38.6 billion for Amazon. 

Amazon is also under fire in India after thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by Reuters show it ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India.
It also faces a Washington D.C. antitrust lawsuit over its agreements with wholesalers as well as third-party sellers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co on Tuesday raised its full-year operating profit outlook by a fifth as its margins got a boost from newer models and lower sales incentives due to tight supplies of vehicles.
Nissan like other big global carmakers has been forced to cut production because of a shortage of semiconductors and other components. But vehicle demand in key markets such as China and the United States is growing as consumer spending rebounds following a pandemic-induced slump.
""Two years ago, we had a problem of how to sell, and that is not the problem today,"" Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told a news conference.
Nissan had also benefitted as it revamps its aging model line-up as part of a business plan to improve profitability by reducing global production and model types by a fifth, he added.
Nissan's break even point is now around 3.7 million vehicles a year, down from 4.4 million, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ma said.
Nissan now expects a full-year operating profit of 180 billion yen ($1.59 billion) compared with an earlier prediction for 150 billion yen. That is higher than a mean 161 billion yen profit based on forecasts from 23 analysts, Refinitiv data shows. 
Last week, Honda Motor Co cut its full-year operating profit outlook 15% to 660 billion because of the chip shortage, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp cut its annual vehicle sales target and warned that the lack of semiconductors still posed a risk to its production plans.
Nissan's Gupta cautioned that the lack of chips remained ""a challenge"" as competition for the key component grows among automakers and electronic device makers. 
Japan's No. 3 carmaker lowered its global sales target to 3.8 million vehicles from 4.4 million.

Nissan posted an operating profit of 62.8 billion yen for the three months to Sept. 30 compared with a loss of 4.8 billion yen a year earlier. That result was better than an average 4.4 billion yen loss forecast from 10 analysts, Refinitiv data shows.

1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>","U.S. Rent Hikes Are Spreading to Older, Cheaper Apartments","(Bloomberg) -- The biggest rent increases of the past year in the U.S. were mostly focused on higher-end properties. Now older buildings with lower-income tenants are catching up. 
Rent growth in so-called Class B units outpaced that of Class A apartments from March to October, according to rental marketplace Zumper.
Class B buildings are generally older and more affordable. The rents are usually less volatile than for Class A apartments, whose rental prices collapsed in many urban areas last year as dwellers deserted city centers at the onset of the pandemic -- and have since bounced back. 
The new trend is making it tougher for lower-income households to afford their rents, and signals that the housing market is becoming even hotter. Renters who are priced out of more expensive apartments or homes are moving to Class B communities. 
“We have seen dramatic and pronounced rent growth across the multifamily market that is just now catching up to the ‘scalding hot’ single-family housing market,” said James Morgan, principal at Morgan Properties, the second-largest owner of multifamily properties. “It comes down to supply and demand.”
Morgan said rent growth was 10% this year through September across the company’s 93,000 units. That’s up from 3.9% in the 12 months following the start of the Covid-19 crisis.
One driving factor is increasing wages for workers who help maintain the buildings, Morgan said. At the same time, typical, working-class renters of Class B properties also have benefited from nationwide gains in hourly wages.
Morgan anticipates that rents will continue to rise at above-average rates through the first half of next year -- although he doesn’t expect that increases of 10% or more will become the norm in 2022 and 2023.
“Until the supply of new homes and new apartment buildings increases, we can anticipate price increases to be here to stay,” he said.

But can the stock continue to rally even though the company’s costs and expenses have risen over the last quarter? Let’s find out.
Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB), which is headquartered in San Francisco, attracted huge investor interest when it made its stock market debut last December. The company operates a platform that facilitates temporary accommodation for guests worldwide. Its shares have climbed in price over the past few weeks and peaked at $203.29 on November 5, thanks to its stellar third-quarter earnings. The stock has gained 17.9% over the past month and 18% over the past week to close yesterday’s trading session at $200.32.
The U.S. government’s elimination of its travel ban on more than 33 countries has been a catalyst for ABNB’s business revival. Furthermore, investors’ sentiment about traveling improved with the November 5 announcement that  Pfizer  Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 pill reduces the risk of being hospitalized or dying from the virus by 89%.
However, ABNB’s cost of revenue in the third quarter (ended September 30, 2021) increased 37% year-over-year to $312 million due to an increase in merchant fees driven by higher Nights and Experiences Booked. In addition, a company director, Jeffrey Jordan, sold 25,000 shares in September 2021. So, ABNB’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday that deliveries fell to 27 airplanes in October while its 787 remains sidelined, but the U.S. planemaker seized on strong air cargo demand by winning an order for two 777 freighters for Maersk's Star Air.
October's deliveries were eight fewer than in September but 14 more than in October last year, according to closely watched company data released on Tuesday. 
Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and its 737 MAX are integral to the company's ability to rebound from the pandemic and a safety scandal caused by two fatal crashes. 
Of the 27 aircraft delivered last month, 18 were 737 MAXpassenger jets - six of which were for European low-cost carrier Ryanair. It also delivered two 737-800 business jets to an unnamed buyer, and two P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to the U.S. Navy, Boeing said.
The remaining five jets were larger widebodies feeding cargo capacity: a 747 freighter to  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), one 777 and one 767 for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), a 777 freighter for Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp, and one 767-based tanker for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing said.
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to idle unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters at a time when e-commerce has been a lifeline for many. 
This year, Boeing has delivered 268 aircraft, including 241 through September. It delivered 111 in the first 10 months of 2020.
Of the sales this year, 212 were its best-selling 737 MAX jets, which returned to service in late 2020 after a near two-year safety ban.
But Boeing continues to grapple with structural defects inits bigger 787, which have caused it to cut production and haltdeliveries. 
""We have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead"" on resuming 787 deliveries, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts last month. He gave no specific timeline pending regulatory approvals.
Boeing sold seven aircraft in October, after cancellations and instances where a buyer converted an order for one type ofaircraft to another.
It had 10 gross orders, which included eight 737 MAX jets whose buyer was unidentified, and two 777 freighters for Maersk's Star Air.

Boeing said Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp canceled an order fortwo 787-10 jets in October, while Aviation Capital Group dropped one 737 MAX. 
That brings orders for the year so far from 710 to 720, or from 302 to 309 after cancellations and conversions, Boeing said.

PARIS (Reuters) -French supermarket group  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) on Tuesday pledged to spend 3 billion euros ($3.47 billion) between 2022 and 2026 to step up digital commerce expansion and boost profits, in line with boss Alexandre Bompard's future strategy plan.
As Europe's largest food retailer looks to stay ahead of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on grocery deliveries and to speed up an ongoing turnaround, the main drivers of an online push will be e-commerce - boosted by express delivery and innovative services - the ramp-up of data and retail media, and the digitalisation of financial services. 
""Digital will be the centrepiece of our next strategy plan to 2026. It is a tremendous opportunity for Carrefour,"" Chairman and CEO Bompard told investors at the group's Digital Day.
By 1442 GMT, Carrefour shares gained 2.2% at 15.70 euros. The shares are however 30% below their level when Bompard took over in July 2017. He secured a further three-year term in May. 
Carrefour has spent 2 billion euros since 2018 on technology and digital expansion under the first leg of its turnaround plan, tripling its food e-commerce activity in the process. 
As a result of the new digital push, Carrefour is raising its total annual investment target to around 1.7 billion euros, the higher end of a 1.5-1.7 billion range given in early 2021.
""As a successful first transformation plan comes to its end, we now want to transform Carrefour, a traditional retailer with e-commerce capabilities, into a digital retail company, which places digital and data at the heart of all its operations and its value creation model,"" Bompard said.
Commenting on competition from Amazon, Bompard said: ""Today it is very difficult for them to enter the food market, notably fresh food. We must look for the model they cannot replicate,""
Carrefour said the extra investment would help it to triple its e-commerce Gross Merchandise Value - the total value of merchandise sold - by 2026 to 10 billion euros.
It expected digital to contribute an extra 600 million euros to recurring operating income in 2026 versus 2021. ""This will be a minimum,"" finance chief Matthieu Malige added.
With Carrefour in the later stages of a five-year turnaround plan launched in January 2018, he faces the challenge of conducting the second leg without the extra financial resources that would have been on hand if two planned tie-ups https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/carrefour-auchan-end-exploratory-talks-over-potential-194-bln-deal-source-2021-10-11 this year had not failed - one with Canada's Couche-Tard and one with France's Auchan.
Past digital initiatives have ranged from a strategic partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to rapid grocery delivery services deals with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).

Carrefour on Tuesday said it was setting up a dedicated venture capital fund to enable it to take minority stakes in companies involved in innovations and emerging technologies.

Investing.com – PayPal stock (NASDAQ:PYPL) plummeted more than 12% Tuesday as the payments company lowered its outlook for sales and the volumes it will process during the year.
Third-quarter performance suffered as transactions tied to eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) marketplace slid 45%, according to a statement by PayPal. That led to the company missing analysts’ forecast for third-quarter sales. A raft of downgrades followed.   
PayPal now expects 2021 revenue to grow by around 18% to $25.35 billion at the midpoint, compared to around 20% growth the firm had guided earlier.
It also lowered the top end of its growth forecast for total payment volumes processed to 34% from 35% earlier. It kept the lower end of around 33% growth unchanged.
Ebay’s share of PayPal’s TPV more than halved to 3%. This loss was expected since the two decided to end their longtime partnership in 2018 but the pace of decline may hold a surprise for the payments company.
Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman attempted to paint the company’s agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the next big thing. The company said the tie-up will enable Venmo’s 80+ million users in the U.S. to pay with Venmo on Amazon starting next year.
Net revenue in the third quarter rose 13%, to $6.18 billion. Profit per share of $1.11 was higher than estimates.
Piper Sandler lowered the price target for PayPal shares to $280. Truist Securities sees them at $200. Deutsche, RBC and Rosenblatt also lowered their targets. The stock touched a low of $200.83 so far in the session.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>",Telecom Italia: looking for the right connections,"(Repeats to additional subscribers)
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) board members will face off this Thursday over plans to reorganise Italy's biggest telecoms group and extract value from its main network assets as top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) challenges TIM CEO Luigi Gubitosi.
Under pressure to raise cash after two profit warnings in three months, Gubitosi last month presented the board proposals to carve out assets and attract new investors for parts of TIM's portfolio, including its key landline grid that supplies broadband and fixed-line services to millions of Italian homes and businesses.
But the plan from the 60-year old CEO, who secured a second-term in March, got a cool reception from Vivendi -- leading shareholder in the former phone monopoly ahead of state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP).
Last week it emerged private equity firm KKR is eyeing further investment in TIM's fixed-line network on the prospect of some kind of tie-up with smaller wholesale-only fibre-optic rival Open Fiber.
Options for TIM's network assets will be discussed at a special board meeting on Nov. 11 as requested by Vivendi representatives Arnaud De Puyfontaine and Frank Cadoret and three other independent board members.
WHAT AILS TIM?
TIM has seen revenue shrink by a fifth over the past five years due to aggressive competition from rivals such as Iliad, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), Wind Tre and Fastweb on its home market where it needs to boost investments to meet increasing demand for digital services. 
TIM's 22 billion euro ($25 billion) debt, supported by its network asset, is rated 'junk' by the three main credit rating agencies.
WHO CALLS THE SHOTS AT TIM? Vivendi holds 24% of TIM but does not control its board which has a majority of independent directors. CDP has built a stake of almost 10% in TIM but holds just one seat out of 15.
WHAT DOES CDP WANT? Treasury-owned CDP, which is close to becoming Open Fiber's controlling shareholder with a 60% stake, sees superfast fibre networks as strategic for the country. It invested in TIM to oversee the group's network and offset Vivendi's influence.
Last year it backed a plan sponsored by the previous government to create a single entity combining all TIM's network access with Open Fiber.
That plan, which envisaged TIM keeping a majority stake in the new company while giving CDP vetting powers on strategic issues, has stalled with key figures in Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition opposing it and question marks hanging over whether it would ever get past regulators in Brussels. WHAT DOES VIVENDI WANT? Vivendi, facing a potential 1.8 billion euro capital loss on its TIM stake at current market prices, wants to have more of a say in mapping the group's future and has called into question Gubitosi's role after backing his reappointment in March. The CEO has been trying to persuade Vivendi that giving CDP control in a network tie-up with Open Fiber is the only way to overcome regulatory and political resistance to such a plan.
Vivendi has always opposed TIM handing over control of its most-prized asset and wants a direct line with the government over strategic options for the group.WHAT DOES KKR WANT?
KKR last year spent 1.8 billion euros for a stake in TIM's 'last-mile' FiberCop grid linking street cabinets to homes. It not only wants to protect that investment but is keen to boost exposure to TIM's fixed-line assets as Italy prepares to spend billions of euros of European Union recovery funds to boost digital connectivity.

The prospect of an Open Fiber deal regaining traction has set alarm bells ringing and it is eyeing a further investment in TIM's network assets to strengthen its hand, sources have said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa's Telkom is considering options to boost its technology division, including a partnership or acquisition, it said on Tuesday, after weaker-than-expected results at the company's mobile business hit its shares. 
Telkom's technology division, part of its BCX unit, offers information and communication technology services such as cloud computing, cyber security, analytics and network infrastructure to large and mid-sized companies in South Africa. 
The business has been under pressure due to sluggish investments by firms hit by the pandemic, global supply chain issues and chip shortages, the company said. 
Speaking to analysts, group CEO Sipho Maseko said BCX was exploring options that could bring in new capabilities and skills, and help expand into new markets. 
During an interview with Reuters, Maseko said Telkom could also look at acquiring companies in areas where it cannot grow its skills ""organically.""
""We may have to complement that, either with local niche acquisitions as an option, alternatively a global strategic equity partnership to help fortify that niche area.""
BCX, which accounts for roughly a third of the company's turnover, saw its revenue decline by 6.1% to 7.5 billion rand ($498 million) in the six months ended Sept. 30.
Telkom, the third biggest mobile operator in South Africa, posted a 30.4% rise in headline earnings per share (HEPS) to 285.5 cents for the period.
However, its shares dropped around 12% as it reported lower than expected growth of 6.8% in mobile service revenue and 6.1% in mobile data revenue.

Some analysts were also disappointed by an 839 million rand free cash outflow, which compared with an inflow of 211 million rand in the same period last year, although the company said it expected cash flows to normalise in the second half of the year.

Investing.com — Evgo Inc (NASDAQ:EVGO) stock added to yesterday's rally by jumping another 25% Tuesday after it announced it is expanding its partnerships with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and  Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER). 
On Monday, the electric vehicle charging business told investors that it had been awarded several grants in Pennsylvania. Alongside the news about the infrastructure bill, that announcement helped EVgo's shares close the day up 34%. 
And, the positive updates for EVgo investors have continued Tuesday, with the company revealing that it will be expanding its fast-charging infrastructure build-out collaboration with General Motors, which is currently underway across the U.S.
EVgo and GM previously announced it had tripled the network, with plans to build 2,750 charging stalls through 2025.
However, the companies said that in response to increasing demand for charging infrastructure and new vehicles being introduced in the program's later years, they have expanded their plan to add another 500 high-powered DC fast chargers. This brings the total to 3,250 and extends the reach from 40 markets to 52.
""We are thrilled to expand the scope of our collaboration with GM – a testament to our successful partnership,"" said EVgo CEO Cathy Zoi.
While the GM news alone was enough to see the stock rally, EVgo made an additional announcement that it is increasing its EV charging program for Uber's rideshare drivers.
The expanded partnership will provide Uber drivers with increased access to EVgo's network of over 800 public fast chargers. There will also be new discounts and benefits for drivers, with the companies hoping that this will encourage further EV adoption.
""The enhanced incentives from EVgo's program help drivers save money and take another step towards transforming Uber into a zero-emissions platform,"" said Adam Gromis, Head of Sustainability Policy at Uber.

Kaufer will continue to lead the company until a successor is found. Several operational indicators remained below the same quarter in 2019.
More was expected from the travel guidance company as most economies, including U.S. and Europe, reopened and people looked to travel. Analysts expected the upcoming holiday season to propel the company higher but the doubling of revenue to $303 million wasn’t enough to meet that expectation.
The company’s outlook lacked the confidence traders wanted. It said the pandemic-related challenges continue to add near-term uncertainty to the recovery, and therefore it is not anticipating the current-quarter revenue to show a meaningful improvement compared to 2019 levels. That compares with last week’s positive commentary from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB).
Third-quarter consolidated revenue was around 71% of revenue in the 2019 quarter.
Overall, average monthly unique users on Tripadvisor websites were approximately 76% of 2019’s comparable period.
Net profit was $1 million, riding on higher revenue and was partially offset by selling and marketing expenses incurred on rising demand for travel.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday after producer prices data for October reminded the market that inflation remains a live issue - and one that policymakers appear in little hurry to address.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 79 points, or 0.2%, at 36,354. The S&P 500 was effectively unchanged and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. All three indices had ground out new record highs on Monday but appeared to be consolidating after a week of strong gains. 
Factory gate prices rose another 0.6% in October, while the core PPI gain accelerated to 0.4% from 0.2% in September. That left the headline annual rate of producer price inflation at 8.6%, a fraction lower than forecasts, and the core rate at 6.8%, unchanged from September and in line with expectations. That's still nearly twice as high as at any time in the last 10 years. 
However, the risk of the Federal Reserve moving to raise interest rates quickly appears to have receded a little further since Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference last week. Reports indicate that President Joe Biden interviewed governor Lael Brainard - a woman usually seen at the dovish end of the policy-making spectrum - for the chairman's position last week. Biden has promised a decision soon on whether or not he wil reappoint Powell for a second term.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock grabbed headlines for the wrong reasons again, falling 8.4% after a stock exchange filing showed that Kimbal Musk, brother of the company's CEO Elon, sold stock only a day before the latter's latest PR gimmick, polling his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers on whether or not to sell stock. The CEO had previously indicated that he has a big tax bill looming due to the exercise of previously granted stock options, and his holding in Tesla accounts for the lion's share of his fortune, leaving him few other ways of meeting the tax demand. 
The disclosure reignited concern about Tesla's governance, at a time when Elon Musk is being sued by Tesla shareholders for allegedly overpaying with company money to buy SolarCity, which was at the time controlled by one of Musk's relatives.
The company that made Musk's first fortune, PayPal, was also down heavily, though for completely unrelated reasons. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock fell 12.4% after trimming its guidance for full-year earnings. The announcement of a deal expanding the use of its Venmo app on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ecosystem failed to offset that. 
Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock rose 29% after it posted blowout earnings that testified to the staying power of the gaming boom even as the pandemic recedes. Mobile games maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) stock also rose 7.6%, after its quarterly report showed it benefiting from the same trends. 
Elsewhere,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock rose 5.3% after the company said it will complete its corporate breakup by 2024, splitting into three separate companies concentrating on aviation, healthcare and energy. It also repeated that it's on course to meet its three-year debt reduction target by year-end.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also resumed its decline, falling 4.3% against a backdrop of rising competition from antiviral pill remedies for Covid-19 that may eat into future vaccine sales. Fellow vaccine-maker BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) also fell, but less dramatically so, losing only 2.1% after bumping up its revenue guidance for this year.

Finance chief Jason Liberty will takeover as CEO,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) said on Tuesday, and will be tasked with taking the company back to pre-pandemic levels as sailing operations slowly restart more than a year after operations were suspended.
Fain was one of the key leaders to push for a safe restart of sailings during the pandemic that wiped off half of Royal Caribbean's market valuation in 2020. 
The company teamed up with rival Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd to form a task force to help develop safety standards for restarting the industry.
Royal Caribbean became the first major cruise operator to resume operations from U.S. ports in June, and booking trends for 2022 are reaching historical ranges due to pent-up demand from travelers, the company has said.
Fain, who will step down in January 2022, said ""it was the right time to step down"" with most of the company's ships operating and the group nearing a full return to cruising.
During his tenure, Fain spearheaded the company's expansion into a group with nearly 60 ships, spanning several cruise line brands including Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.

Fain would remain chairman of the board and will work with Liberty, who joined Royal Caribbean in 2005 and took up the role of chief financial officer in 2013.
Royal Caribbean also said its senior vice-president Naftali Holtz will assume the CFO's role.

TSMC, a major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, said in a statement the new chip fabrication plant will produce advanced 7-nanometer chips as well as mature 28-nanometer semiconductors. 
The construction of the factory will begin in 2022 and production is scheduled in 2024.
The company declined to say how much it was planning to spend for the new plant.
Tech powerhouse Taiwan, home to chip makers like TSMC, has become front and centre of efforts to resolve a shortage of chips that has shut global auto production lines and impacted consumer electronics makers around the world.

Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group said it would invest about $500 million in a joint venture with TSMC that will build a $7 billion chip plant in Japan, using its mature 22-nanometer and 28-nanometer technology.
TSMC has pledged to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand chip capacity and is building a $12 billion chip fabrication plant in the U.S. state of Arizona.

LONDON (Reuters) -Barclays has appointed Paul Compton as head of its investment banking business, the British bank said on Tuesday, as part of a wider reshuffle in the wake of Chief Executive Jes Staley's departure.
Compton was  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' global head of banking and had been co-heading the investment bank along with CS Venkatakrishnan before the latter's move to CEO following Staley's shock resignation last week.
Staley left the bank after a dispute with British financial regulators over how he described his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In the wake of his departure incoming CEO Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, said he would make changes to Barclays' leadership.
Those include elevating Compton as sole head of the investment bank. 

A fellow former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker like Staley and Venkat, Compton was Staley's right-hand man in much of the restructuring of Barclays that he undertook during his tenure, focused on streamlining its back-office operations and cutting costs.
Venkat also named Alistair Currie as head of Barclays' consumer banking and payments business, with Ashok Vaswani moving into a new role as chief digital strategy officer.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>","One year from Pfizer vaccine news, some unlikely market outcomes","By Danilo Masoni and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - It is exactly a year since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement of a breakthrough on its experimental COVID-19 vaccine but from emerging markets to airline stocks, many of the trades that were expected to benefit from economies reopening have underwhelmed. 
Pfizer-BioNTech's news on Nov. 9, 2020, that their vaccine was more than 90% effective against COVID-19 was seen as a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that had killed more than a million people, pushed the world into recession and roiled markets.
It triggered a frenzy of bets on assets such as emerging markets, ""value"" stocks and high-yielding debt - which suffered most as economies shut down during the pandemic.
Fast forward a year and COVID-19 is no longer the top concern of investors polled each month by BoFA analysts. But markets have not followed the script.
1/ STOCKS
For ""value"" sectors such as banks and energy, dogged for years by low valuations and poor growth prospects, COVID-19 was the final straw, sending MSCI's value index to a record low relative to MSCI Growth. 
The latter comprises high-flying tech sector names. 
Pfizer's vaccine was seen bringing about a value revival, yet several waves of rotation from growth to value in the past year have proved short-lived. The result: the value index is not far off record lows hit in 2020 against MSCI Growth. 
The year saw global stocks add nearly $16 trillion in market capitalisation but much was down to tech, possibly as reopenings - and economic recovery - were stymied by COVID. Tech accounts now for 24% of global market cap, from 20% a year back. 
Airline shares, considered prime vaccine beneficiaries, have risen less than 20%, versus 42% tech gains
""The exuberance of the Pfizer jab one year ago has been replaced by the after-shock of COVID on supply chains, labour market mismatch and inflation angst,"" said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in London.
Underperformance is starkest in emerging equities which have gained a meagre 7% as central banks raised rates to combat inflation and tourism failed to recover.

BONDS
Sovereign bonds were among the biggest losers immediately after the vaccine news. But over the following year, safe-haven, low-yielding Swiss and Japanese bonds have led returns while holders of relatively high-yielding debt from Italy and Australia endured losses.
U.S., British and German 10-year government borrowing costs have jumped 40-65 basis points; U.S. yields are on track for their biggest annual rise since 2013.

CURRENCIES
A 100%-plus oil price rise has sent the Norwegian crown and Canadian dollar up 6% and 4% respectively. 
But other reflation bets such as the euro and the Australian dollar have been hit by China's economic slowdown and signs their central banks will move slowly with policy tightening.
With the U.S. dollar index up 4.5%, its best year so far since 2015, emerging market currencies have lagged too.
Currencies such as the tourism-oriented Thai baht have started to gain recently, benefiting from the ditching of zero-COVID curbs, rather than vaccinations.

CRYPTO
Bitcoin slipped on Nov. 9, 2020; expectations were that vaccinated retail traders would return to employment and cut back dabbling in crypto. Instead the coin has surged a blistering 340% since then to roughly $68,000.
Rival ether is up almost 1,000%. 

The gains are, however, down to abundant liquidity stemming from central bank and government largesse, rather than vaccines.

Inovio said it now has the authorization to proceed with the trial after 14 months, sending its shares up 4.6% before the bell.
The FDA last year in September put the final-stage trial on hold as it sought more information from the company, including details on a delivery device used to inject genetic material into cells.
Following the decision, the U.S. government pulled funding for the late-stage study for Inovio's vaccine as other COVID-19 vaccines were already available in the country.
Inovio then started late-stage trials outside the United States in partnership with China's Advaccine Biopharmaceuticals. 
The company is currently conducting the Phase 3 portion of its mid-to-late-stage trial in several regions including Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa.

 Renault  (PA:RENA) said in its third quarter earnings call that it was close to reaching its target of cutting fixed costs by 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) by the end of the year, a year ahead of schedule. The aim is to reach 3 billion euros in cost cuts by 2025.
Speaking in Germany at the Automobilwoche Summit, de Meo said the company also still needed to recover from the 8-billion euro loss it suffered in 2020 in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have to bring back Renault in a better condition to be able to invest for the future,"" de Meo said. 
The French carmaker said in October that its output would be cut by 500,000 cars this year, more than double its previous forecast, due to a crippling global semiconductor shortage, but maintained its profit outlook, helped by higher car prices and cost cuts.
At the summit in Germany on Tuesday, de Meo said he expected 20-30% of the carmaker's turnover to come from non-traditional revenue sources within 10 years as he worked to make the company less dependent on other firms.
De Meo, who took the helm at Renault in July 2020 after a career spanning various carmakers, including Fiat and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said he had implemented more projects at the company in the last year than it had seen in the past 12 years in an attempt to simplify the organisation.

""There is still a lot of potential,"" de Meo said. ""But the situation for us is still complicated... I had to chop all the things that were not necessary and then restart.""

Ratings agencies including Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch in recent months have also upgraded Deutsche, the nation's largest lender.
The bank embarked on a restructuring in 2019, closing some businesses and shedding thousands of staff in an effort to return to profitability. In 2020, the bank posted its first full-year profit since 2014. 
The reorganisation of Deutsche Bank is more decisive in addressing the bank's main weaknesses with excessive costs and underperforming business units than its previous restructuring programmes, the bank quoted S&P as saying.
""We see greater rigor in senior management's execution of the plan, and the bank is achieving its milestones as it works toward its 2022 financial targets,"" S&P was quoted as saying.
Deutsche Bank added its ratings are now in the ""A"" category with all leading rating agencies.
Credit ratings are critical for any company but especially for a bank such as Deutsche, which, like all financial institutions, is a big issuer of debt securities.

Higher ratings can result in lower funding costs, helping Deutsche return to more sustainable profitability.
""It's very encouraging to see our progress on Deutsche Bank’s transformation recognised, once again, by a leading rating agency,"" said Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",U.S. auto safety regulator awards over $24 million to Hyundai Motor whistleblower,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety regulator announced on Tuesday its first-ever reward to a whistleblower, handing out more than $24 million to a former Hyundai Motor Co employee who provided key information about safety lapses at the South Korean carmaker.
The award to ex-Hyundai Motor engineer Kim Gwang-ho is the biggest ever in a whistleblower case in the auto sector globally, according to law firm Constantine Cannon, which represented Kim. 
It comes as the U.S. regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the U.S. Department of Transportation prepare to propose regulations related to an automotive whistleblower program Congress created in 2015. 
Kim reported to NHTSA in 2016 that Hyundai was failing to address a design flaw linked to its Theta II engines, which were prone to seizing up and even catching fire. 
""This award is the maximum percentage allowed by law,"" NHTSA said in a statement announcing the award. 
“Whistleblowers play a crucial role in bringing information to NHTSA about serious safety problems that are hidden from the agency,"" said Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s Deputy Administrator. 
Citing an internal report from Hyundai’s quality strategy team to management, Kim had told NHTSA the company was not taking enough action to address an engine fault that increased the risk of crashes.
NHTSA found that Hyundai and its Kia subsidiary had delayed recalling affected vehicles, and that the automaker had provided inaccurate information about the problems.
In 2020, Hyundai and Kia's U.S. units agreed to a record $210 million civil penalty after NHTSA said they failed to recall vehicles for engine issues in a timely fashion. 
“I am pleased that I have been justly compensated for the risks I took to protect owners of these defective cars, and grateful that the U.S.’s legal system had a program in place to make this possible,” Kim said in a statement on Tuesday. 
“I hope my reporting leads to real safety improvements, both at Hyundai and throughout the industry,"" he added. 
In 2017, U.S. safety regulators began to investigate if the recalls had covered enough vehicles and were done in a timely fashion. That followed the concerns reported by Kim to the U.S. auto safety regulator. 

The payout to Kim is the first under the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act, passed by Congress in 2015 to create a whistleblower reward program in the Department of Transportation for industry insiders who provide information to safety regulators about defects in vehicles.

Exceeding expectations for third-quarter revenue, the company said it added 34 net new customers and closed 54 deals of $1 million or more. 
Palantir, which provides its software to the United States and its allies, is known for its work with government agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Palantir has had a steady flow of deals from the public sector, including one with the U.S. army to deploy its software to help in defense decision-making as well as a continuing contract with the U.S. National Institutes of Health to support COVID-19 research during the current quarter.
However, shares of the company, backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, were down 2.4% at $26.1 in volatile trading before the bell.
Many analysts have raised concerns over Palantir's dependence on government contracts and its high stock valuation, with frequent mentions of the latter on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum sending its stock rallying at the beginning of this year. 
Palantir has since added many more commercial deals, including a strategic partnership with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) earlier this year. The company said its U.S. non-government revenue more than doubled during the third quarter.
Palantir forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $418 million, above analysts' average estimate of $401.9 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items, the company earned 4 cents per share, in line with estimates.
Revenue rose 36% to $392.2 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, above expectations of $385 million.

(Reuters) - You.com, a startup looking to challenge Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google by developing a more customizable search engine, announced on Tuesday a $20 million investment led by the venture fund of Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) Chief Executive Marc Benioff.
Venture capitalists for years had avoided backing Google competitors because of its dominance of internet searching across most of the world. 
But growing consumer privacy concerns and a resurgence of antitrust scrutiny on Google from regulators in the United States and elsewhere has led to what some investors perceive as an opening.
""We're at a critical inflection point in the internet's history, and we must take steps to restore trust online,"" Benioff said in a press release. He called You.com ""the future of search"".
Benioff's involvement with the startup includes the transfer of the You.com domain name, which he has owned since the 1990s.
Neither he nor the startup would comment on the terms of the URL exchange, and it was not clear whether the transfer formed part of the overall investment. Beyond Benioff's TIME Ventures, other investors include Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures and Day One Ventures.
Founded last year by two former top AI scientists at Salesforce, You.com lets users set preferred websites. For instance, users who like to get information from Reddit and  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) would see rows of search results from those services before links from the broader web.
You.com will not track users across the web nor sell ""privacy-invasive ads"", according to co-founder and CEO Richard Socher. He added the company will not log searches and clicks when users opt for an incognito mode.

The startup aims to collect fees for facilitating transactions like food orders or flight bookings, and wants to help other publishers generate revenue through ads embedded among search results.
New antitrust rules would help You.com grow, Socher said, adding that popular browsers owned by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google in the name of security make it difficult for users to replace Google as the default search.

That compared with a loss of 872 million reais a year earlier and the company said that while demand for air travel continued to pick up in Brazil, it has still only reached 53% of pre-pandemic levels.
Gol said that including losses from the steep depreciation of the Brazilian real and non-recurring items, its quarterly net loss totalled 2.53 billion reais, widening from a loss of 1.72 billion reais a year earlier.
The group's net revenue totaled 1.9 billion reais in the third quarter, up 96.4% year-on-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 464.7 million reais, a 63.6% rise.
The airline said it expects capacity to grow 29% in the fourth quarter year-on-year on the back of higher vaccination rates, Brazil's summer traveling season and the resumption of international flights.
""We expect a growth in sales through the end of the year and are confident that the trend will continue into 2022,"" Chief Executive Paulo Kakinoff said in a securities filing.

Investing.com – Zynga stock (NASDAQ:ZNGA) climbed nearly 7% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as booming demand for mobile gaming led the Farmville creator to raise its annual guidance.
Third-quarter net bookings rose 6% to $668 million in the third quarter and that handed it its best-ever annual topline performance and the largest mobile audience in its history. Revenue jumped more than 40% to $705 million as the gaming ecosystem continued to thrive on the pandemic-driven demand, with ample support from developers and high-speed networks and devices.
‘FarmVille 3’, launched last week, is off to a great start, the company said. ‘Star Wars: Hunters’, its first cross-platform play franchise, will have a soft launch next week.

LONDON (Reuters) -Associated British Foods expects its Primark fashion business to recoup all the sales lost in its last financial year to pandemic lockdowns and plans to accelerate its expansion in the United States and Europe.
Shares in AB Foods (LON:ABF) jumped more than 7% on the improved Primark outlook as well as expectations for ""significant progress"" in 2021-22 earnings for the broader group, which also owns sugar, grocery, ingredients and agricultural operations.
It said Primark's 2021-22 sales would rise by at least the estimated 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) lost to lockdowns and its adjusted operating margin would rally to more than 10% after revenue and profit fell 5% and 11% respectively in 2020-21.
""Whereas a lot of the online players are really worried about compression to their margins, we're talking about how big does the margin increase for Primark,"" John Bason, the group's finance chief, told Reuters.
Unlike many clothes retailers, Primark does not have an online business. 
AB Foods said it was planning to increase the number of Primark stores to 530 by 2026 from 398 as of September, with a focus on the United States, France, Italy and Iberia.
""In the U.S., the potential for new stores is considerable,"" it said.
AB Food's shares were also helped by the payment of a special dividend as part of a new capital allocation policy that could see more shareholder returns.
NO PRIMARK PRICE RISES
The company said Primark was not immune to the challenges of supply chain, raw material cost and labour rate inflation.
""However, we currently expect the impact of these to be broadly mitigated by the transaction currency gain arising from the weaker U.S dollar, improved store labour efficiency and lower operating costs,"" it said.
As a result Primark would not be raising prices for the autumn/winter season, said Bason.
The group was seeing significant cost increases in energy, logistics and commodities, in addition to the impact of port congestion and road freight limitations. It said it was working to offset the impact of these through cost savings.
However, its food businesses would implement price increases where necessary, it said. The company's grocery brands include Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings tea, Jordans cereals, Kingsmill bread and Ovaltine drinks.
Analysts said the price rises would be ""high single digit"".
For the 53 weeks to Sept. 18, AB Foods reported adjusted earnings per share of 80.1 pence and adjusted operating profit of 1.01 billion pounds, both down 1%. Revenue was flat at 13.9 billion pounds.
The sugar business had a particularly strong year, with profit up 75%.
AB Foods is paying a final dividend of 20.5 pence a share and a special dividend of 13.8 pence.
The group also noted that S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has assigned it an 'A' grade long-term issuer credit rating, with a stable outlook, which analysts said raises the prospect of cheaper public debt.

The stock was up 6.4% at 1211 GMT, paring losses so far this year to 12.5%.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",BioNTech sees up to 17 billion eur in vaccine revenue this year,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with partner  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) will likely generate up to 17 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in revenues this year, as booster shots take hold and use in children increases.
Based on planned deliveries of up to 2.5 billion doses so far, BioNTech said in a statement on Tuesday that it expects 16 billion to 17 billion euros in revenue accruing to it from the vaccine this year
That was up from a forecast in August of 15.9 billion euros based on deliveries plus an order backlog of about 2.2 billion doses at the time.
That figure includes milestone payments from partners and a share of gross profit in its partners' territories, the company added.
Pfizer, for its part, last week said it expected to book $36 billion in 2021 sales of the COVID-19 vaccine and forecast another $29 billion from the shot in 2022, topping analyst estimates for both years.
The company reiterated that no clinical data so far suggested the need for a new vaccine that addresses the highly contagious delta variant, or any other current variant, given the efficacy of two or three shots of its established product.
It is, however, working on new vaccine versions targeting the delta and alpha variants to establish a development and launch routine in case the need for adjusting to as-yet unknown variants arises in future.
Other vaccine makers, such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and its partner Oxford University, have embraced a similar approach, in particular to respond quickly to any future mutation that enables the virus to evade established vaccines. 

BioNTech and Pfizer ""are establishing a preemptive prototype approach to evaluate the development, manufacturing and regulatory processes for variant specific vaccines,"" it said.
BioNTech reaffirmed statements by the partners that they expect to manufacture up to 3 billion doses by the end of 2021 and potentially up to 4 billion doses in 2022.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged higher Tuesday, continuing at record levels on the back of a strong earnings season and ahead of the release of key inflation data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 30 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 25 points, or 0.2%.
The three major indices once again closed at record highs on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 100 points, or 0.3%, and the broad-based S&P 500 climbing 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1%, its 11th straight positive session, the longest daily winning streak since December 2019.
The passage of the long-awaited infrastructure bill has added to the positive tone created by a benign central bank as the economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Also helping has been a generally beneficial earnings season - 445 of the S&P 500 companies have reported as of early Monday, and average earnings growth of 38% has been better than the 27% consensus forecast, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts. They also noted that profit margins have held up surprisingly well in a surprisingly broad range of sectors.
The quarterly reporting season is drawing to a close, but DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) is set for a strong start after reporting a jump in earnings due to higher house prices, while Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) are due after the market closes. 
Elsewhere,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) will be in the spotlight after the industrial conglomerate announced plans to split into three separate units, focusing on aviation, health care and energy, after years of underperformance as a conglomerate.
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) will also be in focus after the company, which runs a trading app for retail investors, revealed a data security breach which saw  “a limited amount of personal information” being compromised.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), the U.S.’s largest movie theater chain, posted a narrower loss and higher revenue than expected, while TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), the travel-booking company, disappointed on both the top- and bottom-line with its third quarter results. 
Also of interest will be this week’s inflation data, starting with the producer price index at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), followed by the consumer price index on Wednesday. Economists are expecting producer prices to have risen 0.6% on the month in October, equating to an annual rise of 8.7%. 
Crude prices edged higher Tuesday, continuing recent gains, benefiting from the tight global supply and increasing signs of a post-pandemic economic recovery.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. 
U.S. crude inventories are expected to have risen a third straight week, potentially helping to cap further gains.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% at $82.30 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $83.75.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,825.00/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1581.

By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Oral antiviral pills from Merck & Co and  Pfizer  Inc have been shown to significantly blunt the worst outcomes of COVID-19 if taken early enough, but doctors warn vaccine hesitant people not to confuse the benefit of the treatments with prevention afforded by vaccines.
While 72% of American adults have gotten a first shot of the vaccine, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, the pace of vaccination has slowed, as political partisanship in the United States divides views on the value and safety of vaccines against the coronavirus.
Vaccine mandates by employers, states and the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden have helped increase vaccinations but also fueled that controversy.
Some disease experts fear the arrival of oral COVID-19 treatments may further impede vaccination campaigns. Preliminary results of a survey of 3,000 U.S. citizens by the City University of New York (CUNY) School of Public Health suggest the drugs could ""hamper the effort to get people vaccinated,"" said Scott Ratzan, an expert in health communication at CUNY, who led the research.
Ratzan said one out of every eight of those surveyed said they would rather get treated with a pill than be vaccinated. ""That is a high number,” Ratzan said.
The concern follows news on Friday from Pfizer, maker of a leading COVID-19 vaccine, that its experimental antiviral pill Paxlovid cut the risk of hospitalization and death from the disease by 89% in high-risk adults.
Pfizer's results followed news from Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on Oct. 1 that their oral antiviral drug cut hospitalization and death by half. That drug, known as molnupiravir, won conditional approval in the UK on Thursday. Both need clearance from U.S. health regulators but could be on the market in December.
""By relying exclusively on an antiviral drug, it's a bit of a roll of the dice in terms of how you will do. Clearly, it's going to be better than nothing, but it's a high-stakes game to play,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine.
Six infectious disease experts interviewed by Reuters were equally enthusiastic about the prospect of effective new treatments for COVID-19 and agreed they were no substitute for vaccines.
Even in the face of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus, the vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech remain effective, cutting the risk of hospitalization by a combined 86.8%, according to a government study of U.S. veterans.
They said some unvaccinated people have already relied on monoclonal antibodies - drugs that need to be delivered through intravenous IV infusions or injections - as a backstop in case they become infected. ""I think the Pfizer news is terrific news. It goes hand in hand with vaccination. It doesn't replace it,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University and Baltimore's former health commissioner.
Choosing not to get vaccinated ""would be a tragic mistake,"" said Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) ""These are treatments. This is for the unfortunate who will get sick,"" Bourla told Reuters in an interview on Friday. ""This should not be a reason not to protect yourself and to put yourself, your household and society in danger.""
ANTIVIRAL CHALLENGES
One main reason not to rely on the new pills, the experts said, is that antiviral medications, which stop the virus from replicating in the body, must be given in a narrow window early in the disease because COVID-19 has different phases.

In the first phase, the virus rapidly replicates in the body. A lot of the worst effects of COVID-19, however, occur in the second phase, arising from a defective immune response that gets triggered by the replicating virus, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease expert and the CEO and founder of Just Human Productions, a non-profit multimedia organization.
""Once you develop shortness of breath or other symptoms that would lead you to be hospitalized, you are in that dysfunctional immune phase where the antivirals are really not going to provide much benefit,"" she said. Hotez agreed. He said getting treated early enough could be challenging because the window when the virus transitions from the replication phase to the inflammatory phase is fluid. ""For some people, that will happen earlier; for some, later,"" Hotez said. Hotez said many people in the early phase of the illness feel surprisingly well and may be unaware that their oxygen levels are dropping, one of the first signs that the inflammatory phase of the disease has started. ""Oftentimes, you're not going to realize that you're getting sick until it's too late,"" he said.

The claimants had given Volkswagen eight weeks to consider their demands, which included ending production of internal combustion engine cars by 2030 and reducing carbon emissions by at least 65% from 2018 levels by then, before filing the suit.
Volkswagen rejected the demands on Oct. 28. 
""Volkswagen stands for climate protection and decarbonising the transport sector, but it cannot tackle this challenge alone,"" a spokesperson said in a comment to Reuters. 
""The task of designing appropriate measures belongs to Parliament. Civil court disputes through lawsuits against singled-out companies are not the place or way to do justice to this task of great responsibility.""

A similar lawsuit was filed in late September by the heads of German environmental organisation Deutsche Umwelthilfe against BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), when both companies also rejected demands to end production of fossil fuel-based cars by 2030 and limit CO2 emissions before then.
The lawsuits draw on two prior climate-related cases: a German ruling in May 2020 that the country was failing to protect future generations from the consequences of climate change, and a Dutch ruling the same month ordering oil firm Shell (LON:RDSa) to reduce its emissions, the first time a private company was held responsible for its impact on the climate.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Musk's potential Tesla stake sale follows share surge,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Should Elon Musk decide to unload some of his stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, he will be capitalizing on a massive rally that has made the electric-vehicle maker one of the world's most valuable companies.
The Tesla chief asked his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers on Saturday if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. Nearly 58% said they would support such a sale, leading the stock to fall 4.9% when trading resumed on Monday.
Musk polled his Twitter followers after a jump in Tesla shares in recent weeks extended a strong, if volatile, run for the stock since it was added to the S&P 500 index late last year.
Trading in Tesla has averaged $19 billion a day in the past three months, more than any other U.S. company, according to Refinitiv data. 
Here is a closer look at Tesla's shares:
After falling in the first half of 2021, Tesla shares have soared in recent weeks. Since Oct. 20, the stock has gained some 34%, with the S&P 500 up 3.6% over that time, a move that has pushed the electric-car maker's market value over $1 trillion.
With those recent gains, Tesla shares have now surged 67% since the stock joined the S&P 500 in late December, versus a 27% gain for the benchmark index over that time. 
(For graphic on Tesla shares since joining S&P 500 - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/byvrjkrzwve/chart.png) 
Tesla accounts for about 2.5% of the S&P 500's $4 trillion market capitalization. That compares to 1.8% when Tesla joined the index in December 2020. 
(For graphic on Tesla in the S&P 500 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkamzzvq/Pasted%20image%201636404344233.png) 
Tesla's valuation has crept lower in recent months, as analysts increase their earnings forecasts. Analysts on average see Tesla's 2022 earnings per share at $7.92, up from an average estimate of $5.50 per share in February.
However, Tesla's PE valuation remains sky-high, with the stock now trading at 150-times future earnings, compared to 21 times for the S&P 500. 
(For graphic on Tesla's forward P/E - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkreegrpm/Pasted%20image%201636404441389.png) 
Short bets against Tesla have declined this year as the stock's rally forced some investors to cover their positions.
The number of Tesla shares shorted stood at 29.5 million, down from 60.6 million at the start of January, analytics firm S3 Partners said on Monday. The short position in Tesla as a percentage of the company's float is down to 3.6% from about 8% at the start of the year.
Still, Tesla's short interest, a measure of the stock's price and number of shares shorted, amounted to nearly $36.1 billion, larger than any other stock, according to S3. 
(For graphic on Bets against Tesla shares fall - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/TESLA/zjvqkwwkjvx/chart.png) 

Tesla and other car companies' shares have notched big swings this year as the auto sector goes through upheavals related to the global supply crisis and other effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla's stock has gained or lost 2% in a session 99 times so far in 2021, compared to 79 times for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and just five times for the S&P 500.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>","Retailers lose love for Asia: Snarled supply chains force manufacturing exodus to Balkans, LatAm","By Siddharth Cavale and Corina Pons
(Reuters) - Major clothing and shoe companies are moving production to countries closer to their U.S. and European stores, smarting from a resurgence in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Vietnam and China that slowed or shut down production for several weeks earlier this year. 
The disclosures come amid a massive shipping logjam that is driving up costs and forcing companies to rethink their globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs in Asia.. 
The latest example is Spanish fashion retailer Mango, which told Reuters on Friday it has ""accelerated"" its process of increasing local production in countries such as Turkey, Morocco and Portugal. In 2019, the company largely sourced its products from China and Vietnam. Mango told Reuters that it would ""considerably"" expand the number of units manufactured locally in Europe in 2022. 
Similarly, U.S. shoe retailer Steve Madden on Wednesday said it had pulled back production in Vietnam and had shifted 50% of its footwear production to Brazil and Mexico from China, while Rubber clogs maker  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) said last month it was moving production to countries including Indonesia and Bosnia. 
Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Czech Republic, Morocco and Turkey were some of the countries drawing new interest from clothing and shoe producers, though China continues to produce a large share of the apparel for U.S. and European clothing chains. 
""We are seeing a lot of growth in freight and trucking activity in the former Soviet Republics ... a big rise in Hungary and Romania,"" said Barry Conlon, chief executive of Overhaul, a supply chain risk management firm. 
In Turkey, apparel exports are expected to reach $20 billion this year, an all-time high, driven by a spike in orders from the European Union, Turkey’s Union of Chambers Clothing and Garment Council data showed. In 2020, exports totaled $17 billion. 
In Bosnia & Herzegovina, exports of textiles, leather and footwear amounted to 739.56 million marka ($436.65 million) in the first half of 2021, which was higher than for all of 2020. 
""Many companies from the European Union, which is our most important trading partner, are looking for new suppliers and new supply chains in the Balkan market,"" said Professor Muris Pozderac, secretary of the association of textile, clothing, leather and footwear in Bosnia & Herzegovina.
In Guatemala, where Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) significantly shifted its private-label volume production in 2020, clothing exports were a touch over $1 billion as of the end of August this year, up 34.2% from 2020 and even 8.8% higher than in 2019. 
To be sure, many companies are also still heavily reliant on Vietnam, where recent production stoppages have caused significant disruptions. Vietnam’s government said in October that it will fall short of its garment exports target this year, by $5 billion in a worst-case scenario, due to the impacts of coronavirus restrictions and a shortage of workers. 
Factory inspections in Vietnam - a proxy for retailer manufacturing orders - fell 40% in the third quarter versus the second quarter, with production during those months quickly moving to Bangladesh, India and Cambodia. Inspection rates in Vietnam were still hovering at lower levels in the fourth quarter, with a small uptick seen in late October, said Mathieu Labasse, vice president of QIMA, a supply-chain quality control and auditing firm that represents more than 15,000 brands. 
Apparel maker VF Corp (NYSE:VFC) and outdoor gear maker  Columbia Sportswear  (NASDAQ:COLM) were among companies that warned that there would be delays in fall and spring collections and in some cases insufficient size assortments. 

Michael Kors handbags maker Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) said on Wednesday that it would not have the inventories it wanted for the holiday season, while athletic gear maker Under Armour (NYSE:UA) said on last Tuesday it was canceling purchase orders from Vietnam just to help get ""the factories get back up and caught up.""

Under the terms of the deal, Turkey's Koc Holding will buy an 18% stake in Yapi Kredi for 300 million euros ($347 million), Italy's second-biggest bank said in a statement late on Monday. The remaining 2% will be sold on the market. 
The transaction will have a low-mid single digit positive impact on UniCredit's best quality capital, a key measure of financial strength, it said.
At the same time, the bank will book a non-cash hit of 1.6 billion euros to its fourth-quarter earnings due to currency reserves linked to the stake.
The accounting charge has no impact on UniCredit's capital and it does not affect its underlying net profit, a measure of profit stripped of one-off items which the bank uses for its capital distribution policy.
""The deal is coherent with the group's strategy of exiting areas with low capital returns, high earnings volatility and no active control,"" BofA analyst Alberto Cordara said in a note confirming a ""buy"" rating on the stock.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:32AM ET</span>",Bangladesh's Beximco to sell first generic version of Merck COVID-19 pill,"By Sachin Ravikumar
(Reuters) -A Bangladeshi drugmaker will soon begin selling the world's first generic version of Merck's COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir, which has been touted as a potential game-changer in the fight against the pandemic.
Beximco Pharmaceuticals will first sell generic molnupiravir in Bangladesh before considering exports based on global regulatory approvals, it said on Tuesday. The generic version has received emergency use authorisation from Bangladesh's drug regulators.
Generic drugs like Beximco's are less expensive versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals and help expand access to treatments in poorer countries.
Molnupiravir, developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, received its first regulatory approval globally in the UK last week. It is under regulatory review in the United States and Europe.
""We believe (generic molnupiravir) could play an important role in combating the pandemic, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access to vaccines has been limited,"" Beximco Managing Director Nazmul Hassan said in a statement.
The medicine will have a maximum retail price of 70 taka (82 cents) per capsule, or 2,800 taka ($33) for a full course, a Beximco representative said, adding it was trying to lower prices.
The U.S. government is buying 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at $700 per course. Many Asian countries have agreements to buy the drug at cheaper prices.
A number of companies are racing to develop drugs to combat the pandemic beyond vaccines, but only a few are developing easily ingestible oral pills.
Molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Experts hailed the results as a potential breakthrough.
Meanwhile,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said last week its experimental pill cut by 89% the chance of hospitalisation or death for adults at risk of severe COVID-19. The news boosted Pfizer's share price while pummelling Merck's.
The Beximco representative said the company does not have an agreement with Merck but can sell generic molnupiravir under a World Trade Organisation waiver of intellectual property rules for COVID-19 drugs in developing countries.
Beximco cannot export to most Western countries as the waiver only allows it to sell generics to less-economically developed countries that do not have a patent protection scheme, the spokesperson said.
Merck did not respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. drugmaker has licensing agreements with at least eight Indian drugmakers for molnupiravir, aiming to turn the South Asian nation into a manufacturing hub for the drug to supply low- and middle-income nations.
It also has a licensing deal with the United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) to allow more companies to make generic molnupiravir.
Beximco said it doesn't expect sales of generic molnupiravir to significantly boost revenues, given currently low COVID-19 infections in Bangladesh, which neighbours India.

Its London-listed shares were up 6.2% at 107.25 pence by 0930 GMT.

Investors are waiting to see if the embattled developer makes coupon payments totaling $148.1 million for three dollar bonds before the end of 30-day grace periods Wednesday. Evergrande missed the initial interest deadlines last month, Bloomberg-compiled data show.  
The due date looms as credit-market stress spreads beyond China’s junk-rated builders. Higher-quality dollar bonds are suffering their worst selloff in months, as investors grow increasingly concerned about the impact on larger property firms and the broader economy. 
While there’s been no indication that Evergrande will miss the payment, any such development could also trigger cross-default clauses among the builder’s $19.2 billion of outstanding dollar notes and give creditors more room to negotiate.  
Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The developer has so far pulled back from the brink of default by meeting other delayed coupons at the 11th hour before the grace period ended. Some holders of an Evergrande unit’s bond did not receive payment for two coupons originally due Saturday, though both notes have a 30-day grace period. It also has two more dollar coupons due in December. 
The firm’s dollar bonds remain at distressed levels as investors price in a high likelihood of an eventual restructuring. Authorities in Beijing have urged founder Hui Ka Yan to help repay Evergrande’s obligations with his personal wealth.
The fallout from the debt crisis had until recent days been largely contained to junk-rated developers. But better quality borrowers, such as those in the technology and banking sectors, are seeing the sharpest selloff since April, when fears of a liquidity crunch at China Huarong Asset Management Co. ignited doubts over the level of support Beijing would offer to indebted state-linked firms. 
Rising stress has already sent yields on Chinese dollar junk bonds to above 23%, effectively freezing many property firms out of the offshore market and leaving them unable to refinance their upcoming debt. New issuance from builders dwindled to the lowest level in 18 months in October.

In September the unit warned in stock exchange filings that it was still looking for new investors and to make asset sales, and that without either it may struggle to pay employee salaries and cover other expenses. It also scrapped plans to list shares in mainland China. 

Despite facing a struggle to secure external investment, Evergrande NEV is still preparing its car production facilities in China's coastal Tianjin city for the Hengchi 5 model, the first it will produce, and aims to start manufacturing early in 2022.

1149,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:18AM ET</span>","A Year After Vaccine Jolt, Bet on Value Stocks Disappoints","(Bloomberg) -- A year ago,  Pfizer  Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) shockingly good Covid-19 vaccine efficacy data triggered bets that cheap stocks would outperform shares of fast-growing companies in the ensuing market rally. That call has worked, but only barely.
MSCI Inc.’s index of global value stocks has outpaced its growth-stock counterpart by just 3 percentage points since the U.S. drugmaker and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on this date last year that their shot prevented most coronavirus infections. Just last month, companies with faster projected earnings growth posted their best monthly return in 11, beating the gains in cheaper shares.
For a while following the vaccine news, value stocks outperformed on the back of recommendations by numerous strategists that an accelerating economic recovery and higher bond yields would drive a rotation out of more expensive companies.
But many market experts underestimated the extent of the earnings resilience of the likes of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp., which continued attracting investors. And investors have worried that a global supply squeeze and a resurgence in coronavirus infections will curb growth and keep interest rates lower for longer.
“The value rally stopped in May this year and has been dead ever since,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. “I think growth will continue to outperform value long-term as I don’t see the profit spread narrowing any time soon unless commodity prices and interest rates come way up from current levels.”
Transatlantic Switch
As part of the shift to value stocks, many brokerages also recommended a transatlantic switch into the lower-priced European market from more growth-heavy U.S. indexes. But that hasn’t paid off, even as European banks and energy sectors surged, and the region still underperformed the U.S.
Some strategists say the value rally still has legs. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc recently reiterated their preference for cheaper stocks. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Monday recommended that investors buy stocks in the U.K., a long-beaten-down market that’s trading at a 38% discount to global peers.
Not all growth stocks have done well. While the two investing styles have performed almost in line with each other, the arrival of vaccines and the economic reopening have certainly weighed on the lockdown winners among pricier shares. 
Shares of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc., the maker of connected exercise bikes, got hammered last week on evidence that the Covid-19 boost has faded.  TeamViewer  AG (DE:TMV), a maker of remote working software, and online retailers ASOS Plc (LON:ASOS) and  Boohoo  Group Plc (LON:BOOH) faced a similar fate in Europe recently.
On the other hand, progress by  Merck & Co . (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer in developing medicines to treat Covid-19 has given a renewed lift to travel and leisure stocks, many of which have yet to scale their pre-pandemic highs. That’s encouraging some investors that value stocks are ready for the next leg of their rally.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>","Nvidia launches new products to plug cars, factories into its Omniverse","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is launching new technology to expand its reach in the automotive industry, including a virtual driving assistant that can park a standard car and a system to speed up the training of autonomous vehicles.
As part of its fall new product event, centered around its ""Omniverse"" simulation technology, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said the company will begin offering automakers a system called Drive Concierge. It uses Nvidia hardware and artificial intelligence software to provide a variety of services, including an autonomous driving function that allows a human-driven vehicle to park itself. 
Another extension of the Omniverse strategy will be a system called ""Omniverse Replicator"" that will simplify and speed up the tasks required to create a virtual world for training automated vehicles. 
Nvidia, the world's biggest maker of graphics and artificial intelligence chips, has been pushing for years to expand technology originally developed for computer gaming and graphics into the auto industry. 
Now, Nvidia is looking to capitalize on the intense competition among automakers to develop vehicles that can drive themselves and deliver sophisticated entertainment and information to the humans on board. 
The firm is working to put high-powered chips and software into vehicles, and also sell technology that can create a highly detailed simulation of a factory to help manufacturers cut costs when building new plants, or an artificial universe for a robotaxi or self-driving truck to learn how to drive.
Nvidia now has $8 billion in automotive revenue booked over the next six years, including business from automated trucking and robotaxi companies, said Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's vice president of automotive.

A number of automakers, including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicle brand, Volvo Car AB and Nio (NYSE:NIO), have partnered with Nvidia to catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's lead in software-driven features.
Mercedes and Nvidia announced in June 2020 a partnership to develop a new generation of Mercedes vehicles with Nvidia's Nvidia Drive Orin AGX platform engineered in to provide autonomous driving and other functions. The first of those Mercedes vehicles is planned to launch in 2024.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp on Tuesday said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies, to put together a system that automakers can use for driver safety features as soon as 2024.
Nvidia makes the computing chips and a software system for autonomous vehicles. But the Silicon Valley-based company largely left the selection and integration of the various sensors that help a car perceive its environment up to automakers.
Nvida shifted course on Tuesday and selected a variety of sensor partners for a system, including those from Hella,  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), Continental AG (OTC:CTTAY) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp. Automakers will still be able to choose other sensors, but Nvidia will ensure the ones from its partners work well with its chips and software. 

""It really doesn't make a whole lot of sense for every OEM to try and develop their own software stack from scratch,"" Austin Russell, chief executive of Luminar, one of the suppliers, told Reuters. ""I think Nvidia will see a lot of success here because there's someone OEMs can depend on to deliver the right stack without having to spend tens of billions of dollars to get there.""
The approach brings Nvidia closer to chip rivals  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. Intel's Mobileye (F:0ME) unit sells a system of software, chips and sensors to automakers, and Qualcomm will have a similar full suite of offering with its $4.5 billion purchase of  Veoneer  (NYSE:VNE) Inc.

Chief Executive Ma'an Razoq later told Reuters that the state-owned airline was now seeking aircraft capable of operating longer, non-stop flights so it could expand in Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia and North America.
""To reach these goals, there must be changes in (the types of aircraft)"" Razoqi said, adding the financial cost of the Airbus deal would remain the same.
The airline in 2014 agreed to order 25 aircraft - 10 wide-body A350-900s and 15 narrow-body A320neos. The deal was later expanded in 2018 to 28 jets, Aldakhan said without providing further details, including which jets it was looking to swap. 
Airbus declined to comment. 
Chairman Aldakhan also told the press conference that Kuwait Airways did not take any financial aid from the government during the coronavirus pandemic, and later told Reuters that it is aiming to achieve a balanced budget by the end of 2025. 
The airline reported a profit of five million Kuwaiti dinars ($16.58 million) in September while the expectations were a loss of three million dinars ($9.95 million), the chairman said.

Investing.com – AMC Entertainment stock (NYSE:AMC) traded over 5% lower in Tuesday’s premarket after the multiplex operator's latest quarterly results showed how far it still has to go to put the pandemic behind it. 
The U.S.'s largest movie theater chain posted a narrower loss and higher revenue than expected but the stock had gone into the results somewhat overextended after rising 28% since the start of the month. 
""We need to sell more tickets in future quarters than we did in the most recent quarter, and adjusted EBITDA is still well below pre-pandemic levels,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said in a press release disclosing the company’s third-quarter numbers.
According to Bloomberg, which quoted Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese, AMC’s domestic market share declined in the third quarter after gains in the first half of the year.
The company lost $5.4 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the quarter, despite having nearly all of its U.S. theaters open for the whole period. The quarter was affected by the surge in Delta-variant Covid-19, which dented appetite for sitting in closed spaces in large gatherings.
That compares to an adjusted EBITDA of $269 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, the last before the pandemic struck.  
Revenue jumped sixfold to $756 million but was still down more than 40% from two years ago. 
Aron, a mini-Twitter celebrity who engages with the audience for feedback on cryptos and new launches, has said October theater admission revenues were the highest of any month since before the pandemic shut its cinemas.

Allegro, which has become the go-to online marketplace in Poland and is enjoying a sales boom accelerated by the pandemic, has been investing in logistics and fintech to gain a competitive edge and create new revenue streams. 
The company said the priority was to invest in GMV (gross merchandise value) growth through retail basics and scaling Allegro Pay, Allegro APM and Allegro fulfilment operations, but that operating margins might be softer in 2022.
Its shares, which have lost more than 40% so far this year amid competition jitters, were down 6% as of 0944 GMT.
""This is another quarter comparable somewhat to the second quarter in terms of lockdowns, in that shopping malls were closed throughout November last year,"" Chief Financial Officer Jon Eastick told Reuters. ""We therefore expect GMV growth rate to be a bit lower in percentage terms than last year.""
""The absolute sales level is looking very promising and we're looking forward to a very successful Christmas sales period.""
Allegro swung to a third-quarter net profit of 324.4 million zlotys ($81.58 million), from a loss of 132 million zlotys a year ago, and above analysts' forecast of 263 million zlotys.
Gross merchandise value, an industry metric to measure transaction volumes, jumped 19.9% to 9.9 billion zlotys, as consumers continued to shop online despite the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.
But the company's adjusted EBITDA/GMV (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin slipped to 4.77% from 4.95% amid higher costs.
Lack of guidance upgrade implies ""quite low"" GMV and adjusted EBITDA dynamics in the fourth quarter, mBank brokerage analyst Pawel Szpigiel told Reuters. 
""Additionally, the management underlined the priority to invest in GMV growth in 2022, which we treat as a sign the profitability will decline,"" he said.
Eastick said a plan to roll-out 3,000 of Allegro's own parcel lockers by 2022 is well on track. He also said the group's new Allegro Pay product was looking to be a very promising GMV driver, with a typical Allegro Pay customer spending about 35% more than they did before they joined Allegro Pay.

Eastick said he was not too worried about the supply chain and logistics issues hitting many retailers, as Allegro can source products through multiple suppliers and merchants to its platform.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp on Tuesday released a set of tools for software developers aimed at helping them create a ""metaverse"" of three-dimensional virtual worlds - and use a lot more computing power from Nvidia's chips in the process.
At the Santa Clara, California, company's annual technology conference, Nvidia released Omniverse Enterprise, which will start at $9,000 per year and be sold by partners such as Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) Ltd, which build powerful computing systems with Nvidia chips for corporate customers.
The Omniverse tools help various apps used to create three-dimensional worlds, such as software from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc, work better together while running on chips made by Nvidia.
In an interview with Reuters, Richard Kerris, vice president of the Omniverse platform at Nvidia, called it ""the plumbing of the virtual worlds. That's what we've built. And that's what we're building with all of these partners.""
But right now, most of those worlds are far from fruition and the tools are mostly being used by businesses.
Kerris told Reuters that Nvidia worked with more than 700 companies to test and develop the software, including firms like telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which used the software to create a ""digital twin"" of a city that it used to test cell phone signal coverage before rolling out physical trucks to install real-world antennas.

Earlier this month,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Aaron Rakers wrote that software and other tools for creating virtual worlds could be a $10 billion market opportunity for Nvidia over the next five years - especially as firms like Meta Platforms Inc, the firm formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), entice people to spend more time in what it calls the metaverse.
Nvidia's stock market value has surged $191 billion since Facebook's capital expenditure announcement on Oct. 25, a two-week gain that is nearly as large as rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s entire market capitalization of $209 billion.

The Office of the Attorney General said it had informed the German carmaker and its Swiss dealership arm this month ""that it considers the investigation to be complete and intends to drop the case,"" it said in a statement, confirming a report by broadcaster SRF.
The defendants and private plaintiffs can still review the case file and submit more evidence before the case is closed officially, it said.
VW admitted in September 2015 it had installed secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make the cars appear cleaner than they were, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.
Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings after a court ruled they must conduct their own investigation into hundreds of complaints lodged in Switzerland. 
The case centred on the potential damage to around 175,000 customers who bought or leased VW group vehicles with diesel motors that at least some VW officials must have known had been manipulated.

SRF said Swiss plaintiffs could still claim damages through civil law, noting VW has already paid out billions abroad. ""But without official culprits, such proceedings in Switzerland are very costly and difficult for individuals,"" it added.
Contacted by Reuters on Tuesday, VW had no immediate comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The Tokyo High Court on Tuesday dismissed a request for an injunction against manufacturer Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd's plan to issue a poison pill, a decision its top shareholder will now appeal to the supreme court.
Asia Development Capital (ADC) is seeking to block Tokyo Kikai from issuing new shares that would dilute its 40% stake and prevent it from mounting a takeover. 
The fund plans to appeal to Japan's supreme court, ADC's lawyer told Reuters, after the Tokyo High Court on Tuesday dismissed its appeal of a lower court ruling against it.
The legal battle is likely to spark concern among foreign investors and could cast a shadow over the future of hostile takeover bids in the world's third-largest economy.
ADC built up its 40% stake in the manufacturer of newspaper printing presses in a matter of weeks. Shareholders in Tokyo Kikai, excluding ADC, have approved an issuance of new shares that would dilute the fund's stake.
In a statement, Tokyo Kikai said it believed its plan to issue new shares was ""legal and appropriate"" and called the court's dismissal of the appeal a ""reasonable decision that recognises the company's argument"".

ADC's original attempt to block the share issue was rejected by the Tokyo District Court.
A victory for Tokyo Kikai holds the potential to make it much easier for other Japanese companies to use poison pills.

Investing.com – Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group stock (T:9984) closed 10.5% higher in Tokyo Tuesday as the Japanese conglomerate said it will buy back up to one trillion yen (around $8.8 billion) of its own shares.
The 25 million shares earmarked for repurchase account for 14.6% of SoftBank’s total shares outstanding, excluding treasury stock.
The Group attributed the move to the stock's depressed valuation. It trades at a deep discount to net asset value (calculated as the value of shares held minus adjusted net interest-bearing debt).
“With a discount this wide, I thought, what would make shareholders happy? A buyback,” Bloomberg quoted founder Masayoshi Son as saying at an investor presentation Monday. “We had a heated discussion at the board meeting. We decided now is the time to buy back shares.”
SoftBank Monday reported a September-quarter loss of 397.9-billion yen, chiefly dragged down by loss of 825.1 billion at its flagship Vision Fund. The losses were caused largely by the Fund's Chinese stocks, which suffered from Beijing's regulatory clampdown earlier in the summer.
SoftBank concluded a 2.5-trillion-yen buyback program last year that helped its valuation more than triple from its pandemic low. But the company’s shares had slid more than 40% from their peak in mid-March after the repurchase program expired."

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court said Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) can pursue a lawsuit accusing Israel's NSO Group of exploiting a bug in its WhatsApp messaging app to install malware allowing the surveillance of 1,400 people, including journalists, human rights activists and dissidents.
In a 3-0 decision on Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected privately owned NSO's claim it was immune from being sued because it had acted as a foreign government agent.
Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms Inc, sued NSO for an injunction and damages in October 2019, accusing it of accessing WhatsApp servers without permission six months earlier to install its Pegasus malware on victims' mobile devices.
NSO has argued that Pegasus helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies fight crime and protect national security.
It was appealing a trial judge's July 2020 refusal to award it ""conduct-based immunity,"" a common law doctrine protecting foreign officials acting in their official capacity.
Upholding that ruling, Circuit Judge Danielle Forrest said it was an ""easy case"" because NSO's mere licensing of Pegasus and offering technical support did not shield it from liability under federal law, which took precedence over common law.
""Whatever NSO's government customers do with its technology and services does not render NSO an 'agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,'"" Forrest wrote. ""Thus, NSO is not entitled to the protection of foreign sovereign immunity.""
The case will return to U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California.
Asked for comment on the decision, NSO said in an email that its technology helps defend the public against serious crime and terrorism, and that it ""stands undeterred in its mission.""
WhatsApp spokesman Joshua Breckman in an email called the decision ""an important step in holding NSO accountable for its attacks against journalists, human rights defenders and government leaders.""
Facebook's case drew support from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Corp, which in a court filing called surveillance technology such as Pegasus ""powerful, and dangerous.""

On Nov. 3, the U.S. government blacklisted NSO and Israel's Candiru for allegedly providing spyware to governments that used it to ""maliciously target"" journalists, activists and others.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 03:41AM ET</span>",Head of Bayer's crop unit quits in aftermath of profit rout,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) said on Tuesday that Liam Condon, the head of its crop science unit which includes  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), would quit at the end of the year following disappointing results.
The maker of pharmaceuticals and agricultural supplies said Condon wanted to pursue other career opportunities and Rodrigo Santos, the Crop Science Division's chief operating officer, would take over from him on Jan. 1.
The news came as Bayer lifted its overall group earnings guidance, helped by demand for its non-prescription pharmaceuticals and better-than-expected sales of eye drug Eylea. 
The crop science division, however, has underperformed in recent years as Condon led it through tumultuous times, including the $63 billion takeover of U.S. seeds giant Monsanto. Orchestrated in 2016 by Condon's boss, Chief Executive Werner Baumann, the takeover later burdened Bayer with billions of dollars in legal costs over claims that Monsanto's main herbicide causes cancer.
Bayer last year fell behind its closest rival  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) in the U.S. market in a race to launch new soy seeds that resist certain weedkillers. Crop science earnings in the second quarter of this year were burdened by rising raw material costs.
Trying to contain the litigation over herbicide Roundup, Bayer in August filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appeals court verdict that upheld damages to a customer blaming his cancer on the glyphosate-based weedkiller.
CEO Baumann last year won a contract extension until 2024, but he said at the time that due to personal plans he had opted for a shorter term than was initially offered to him.
Chairman Norbert Winkeljohann, in the company's statement, thanked Condon for having “successfully led and strategically transformed the Crop Science Division,” but Bayer gave no further reasons for his departure.
Bayer also on Tuesday reported that third-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before special items rose 16.4% to 2.09 billion euros ($2.41 billion), surpassing an average analyst forecast of 1.94 billion.

This was mainly due to prescriptions of Eylea, a treatment to avert blindness, gains at the group's unit making non-prescription remedies and at crop science. The bulk of the agriculture unit's annual earnings are generated during the first half, when farmers in the northern hemisphere typically purchase seeds and pesticides. 
The group said full-year adjusted earnings per share were now expected to come in at between at 6.50 and 6.70 euros, when excluding currency swings. That is up from 6.39 euros in 2020 and compares with a previous target of 6.40 euros to 6.60 euros.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - (This November 8 story corrected to say Tencent earnings will be published on Nov. 10, not Nov. 11) 
China's biggest listed companies Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) are expected to report a fall in profits and slowing revenue growth in the July-September quarter, hurt by the year-long regulatory crackdown that has upended its tech industry.
Beijing has reasserted control over its once-freewheeling internet sector, punishing well-known names for engaging in what were previously considered regular market practices and drafting new rules to change how they compete and engage users.
""We believe the financial impact of regulatory headwinds in China will be reflected in (third quarter) earnings and (fourth quarter) guidance,"" KGI Asia analysts said in a note last month.
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd - the country's largest firm by market value and its first big tech name to report earnings on Wednesday - is expected to post a 12% fall in quarterly profit, its first drop in two years, according to Refinitiv data. 
The gaming giant's revenue is expected to rise 16.4%, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2019, after the government imposed new limits on the amount of time minors can spend playing video games. China's gaming regulator also has not approved any new games since August.
During the quarter, China also barred Tencent from signing exclusive music deals, citing anti-competitive reasons.
E-commerce powerhouse Alibaba, which became China's first regulatory target late last year, is expected to post a 12% decline in profit in the quarter. Revenue will likely rise 32%, the slowest in a year. 
Two quarters ago, Alibaba had posted its first quarterly operating loss since going public in 2014 after it was fined a record $2.8 billion.
Its smaller rival JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc is expected to post a 71% slump in profit and the slowest revenue growth in six quarters. 
Slowing retail sales in China due to COVID-19 lockdowns and recent power shortages will hurt Alibaba and smaller rivals, KGI Asia analysts said.
Big e-commerce companies in China are also facing rising competition from short video apps Kuaishou and ByteDance's Douyin, which have growing e-commerce businesses.
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China's biggest search engine operator, is expected to report that quarterly profit plunged 80%, hurt by a slump in advertising revenue from tutoring centres that have been barred from offering private, for-profit tutoring on the school curriculum. China's efforts to regulate medical beauty advertisements have also hit advertising.

Still, with a recent slowdown in the pace of new regulatory missives that has stoked market optimism, investors will watch closely for clues on whether the worst is over and executives are likely be quizzed on their expectations on conference calls. 
Last month, the central bank's party chief Guo Shuqing, was quoted as saying that most financial problems on China's internet platforms had received a positive response and some had been resolved.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 03:32AM ET</span>",NASA-SpaceX crew returns from record mission aboard International Space Station,"By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) -Four astronauts safely returned on Monday from a record six-month NASA science mission aboard the International Space Station, splashing down with their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of a daylong flight home.
The Dragon vehicle, dubbed Endeavour, parachuted into the sea off the Florida coast as planned just after 10:30 p.m. EST on Monday (0330 GMT Tuesday), following a re-entry descent through Earth's atmosphere carried live by a NASA webcast.
Real-time infrared thermal video imaging captured a glimpse of the capsule streaking like a meteor through the night sky over the Gulf minutes before splashdown. 
Applause was heard from the flight control center as the four main parachutes inflated above the capsule, seen drifting down toward the Gulf surface and slowing to about 15 miles per hour (24 kph) before dropping gently into the calm sea.
""Endeavour, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home to planet Earth,"" a voice from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles was heard telling the crew as a safe splashdown was confirmed.
""It's great to be back,"" one of the astronauts radioed in reply.
The return capped 199 full days in orbit, the longest ever for an entire U.S.-launched crew, according to Kathy Lueders, associate NASA chief for space operations. It surpassed the previous 168-day record set by the predecessor SpaceX-NASA mission earlier this year, she said.
Within an hour of splashdown, the capsule was hoisted from the ocean to the deck of a recovery ship, and the four astronauts were seen emerging one by one from Endeavour's hatch.
Two NASA astronauts on the flight - pilot Megan McArthur, 50, and mission commander Shane Kimbrough, 54 - were the first two out of the vehicle. They were followed by Japanese crew mate Akihiko Hoshide, 52, and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet, 43, a French engineer from the European Space Agency.
Each flashed smiles and a V-for-victory sign as they were helped onto waiting gurneys, unable to immediately bear their own weight after months in microgravity. They were to undergo brief medical checkups then be flown to shore via helicopter. 
FIERY RE-ENTRY
Operating autonomously, the spacecraft began its eight-hour return voyage earlier in the day with a 90-minute fly-around of the space station as the crew snapped a series of survey photographs of the orbiting outpost, circling the globe some 250 miles (400 km) above.
The Crew Dragon then proceeded through a series of maneuvers over the course of the day to bring it closer to Earth ahead of its final night-time descent. 
Propelled by one last ignition of its forward rocket thrusters for a ""de-orbit burn,"" the capsule re-entered the atmosphere at about 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kph) for a free-fall toward the ocean below, during which crew communications were lost for several minutes.
Intense friction generated as the capsule plunged through the atmosphere slowed its descent while sending temperatures surrounding the outside of the vehicle soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,927 degrees Celsius). The bottom of the capsule is covered by a shield that dissipates the heat, preventing the spacecraft from incinerating.
The four astronauts were launched to orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 23. 
It was the third crew sent to the space station under NASA's fledgling public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who also founded electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

The returning team was designated ""Crew 2"" because it marks the second ""operational"" crew that NASA has launched aboard a SpaceX capsule since resuming human space flights from American soil last year, after a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011.
The replacement team, ""Crew 3,"" was originally slated to fly to the space station at the end of October, but that launch has been delayed by weather problems and an unspecified medical issue involving one of the four crew members.

Speedy vaccination drives and an early lifting of lockdowns in Britain have led to a rebound in on-road traffic, but motor insurance premiums have taken a knock due to government caps on policy prices and a global chip shortage slowing down the production of new cars. 
Direct Line - whose insurance brands include Churchill, Green Flag, Shotgun, Privilege and Darwin reiterated its medium-term targets but warned that pricing in the first few months of 2022 would be volatile as the economy resets after the pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp shares jumped 10.5% on Tuesday, the first trading session after the Japanese conglomerate said it would spend up to 1 trillion yen ($8.8 billion) buying back almost 15% of its shares.
The company announced the buyback, long speculated about by the market, after it revealed its quarterly earnings crashed to a loss amid a decline in the share prices of its portfolio companies and a regulatory crackdown in China.
SoftBank's shares closed at 6,808 yen in its biggest daily rise in 11 months, lifting the group's market capitalization above $100 billion. Tuesday's trading volume was more than twice the 30-day average. 
The buyback is SoftBank's second largest after a record 2.5 trillion yen buyback launched during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. Shares of the tech group quadrupled during that buyback, but have since fallen 40% from a peak in May. 
""Our analysis of buyback history indicates that SBG stock performs (and outperforms indices or BABA) during buybacks,"" wrote Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal in a note, referring to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), the group's largest asset. SoftBank owns about a quarter of Alibaba's shares. 
The slide in the Chinese e-commerce giant's shares and the broader regulatory backlash in China contributed to a $57 billion fall in SoftBank's net assets to $187 billion, a metric that Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said is the primary measure of SoftBank's success. 
(For graphic on Buyback dependence Buyback dependence: https://graphics.reuters.com/SOFTBANKGROUP-SHARES/byprjkkkdpe/chart.png)   
The repurchase period for the latest buyback runs to Nov. 8 next year, with the group signalling the programme could take longer than the fast-paced purchases last year. 
The buyback ""is nice support, but it isn't rocket fuel,"" wrote LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato on the Smartkarma platform, adding ""there are material downside risks if broader tech, especially unprofitable tech, falters."" 
Speculation that SoftBank could launch a buyback has been raging for months as the discount - the gap between the value of its assets and its share price - has lingered to the frustration of executives and as investors push for repurchases. 
Ongoing uncertainties include the prospect of gaining regulatory approval for the $40 billion sale of chip designer Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
Delays to the sale ""may have given Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) the flexibility to announce a buyback now with expectations of ramping up share purchases later,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry wrote in a note. 
SoftBank is ramping up investing via Vision Fund 2, which has $40 billion in committed capital from the group and Son himself, even as it winds down activity at trading arm SB Northstar. 
""Even if the company manages its finances with a certain amount of discipline, share buybacks would likely erode the financial buffer if executed,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings analysts wrote in a note. 

The conglomerate held more than 5 trillion yen in cash and cash equivalents at the end of September, an increase of 9% compared to six months earlier.

The Anglo-Dutch oil giant and the Norwegian aluminium maker's green hydrogen unit, Hydro Havrand, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) and begun initial work to identify opportunities to produce and supply renewable hydrogen.
So-called green hydrogen is a zero-carbon gas made by electrolysis using renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, increasingly promoted as a way to decarbonise emissions-intensive industry and transport sectors reliant on fossil fuel.
Shell and Hydro will initially identify which European locations are best suited to produce renewable hydrogen for the companies' own consumption as well as for the broader market, and expand into other locations at a later stage.
""We are looking at potential locations where we both have operations and we have potential to use hydrogen in our existing facilities,"" Per Christian Eriksen, head of Hydro Havrand, told Reuters.
Hydrogen production could be placed in locations where Shell and Hydro both have relatively high gas consumption, and also where there is potential to deliver to a third-party market, for example refineries or other process industries that already use ""grey"" hydrogen made from non-renewable power, Eriksen said.
""Hydro Havrand and Shell can work toward a shared goal of establishing integrated hydrogen value chains and ultimately a strong global market for hydrogen,"" Elisabeth Brinton, Shell's executive vice president for renewables & energy solutions, said in a statement.

Shell and Hydro will spend the coming nine months exploring the opportunities for collaboration, said Arvid Moss, head of Hydro's Energy unit.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) is ahead of its hiring targets for its Chinese retail wealth management business and is exploring re-entering India's private banking business, senior executives said, as part of its plan to make Asia and wealth key pillars of growth.
Under a strategy spearheaded by Group CEO Noel Quinn, HSBC is ploughing $3.5 billion into its wealth and personal banking business, in line with its ambition to become Asia's top wealth manager by 2025.
""We are the leading international bank in China, so we want to squeeze that opportunity,"" said CEO of Wealth and Personal Banking Nuno Matos, one of four top executives moving to Hong Kong from London this year as part of the bank's regional pivot.
""On the private banking side, we are now in clear expansion mode,"" Matos told Reuters in one of his first interviews since moving to the region.
Asia is the biggest region for HSBC, and the wealth and personal banking unit contributed 44% or $22 billion to London-headquartered HSBC's adjusted global revenue last year.
The bank is looking to boost its mobile wealth planning service, HSBC Pinnacle, in China by having about 700 personal wealth planners by the year-end instead of the 550 originally planned, Matos said.
HSBC's wealth management services include investments, insurance and asset management products, while private banking caters to the needs of those with investible assets of $5 million or more.
The bank had 20 people operating in China onshore private banking business at the end of last year, said Siew Meng Tan, head of HSBC Private Banking for Asia Pacific.
""By the end of this year, we will get to 64 and by the end of next year, we'll double that,"" she said.
HSBC is exploring whether to re-enter onshore private banking in India, where the ranks of the super rich are growing fast and record high stock markets have created a string of billion dollar start-ups.
HSBC exited the Indian private banking business in 2015 as part of a group strategy. The lucrative but very competitive Indian market has few foreign players.
""We want to bank mass affluent and high net worth customers. At this moment, the two major pillars we are expanding in India are insurance and asset management,"" Matos said. ""On the private banking side, we are not there yet and that's something that demands a strategic decision this year.""
Currently, HSBC is focusing on catering to wealthy Indians from its global hubs in Singapore, London and the Middle East.
'COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY'
HSBC is also looking to bulk up its Singapore and Southeast Asia presence, Matos said. In August, the bank bought French insurer AXA's Singapore assets for $575 million.
Though HSBC has a dominant Asia presence with its retail banking, particularly in the financial hub of Hong Kong, global leaders such as UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) rule the market for wealthier clients.
Global wealth managers remain bullish about their growth prospects in China despite an unprecedented regulatory crackdown in the world's second-largest economy.
In a global wealth report published in June, Boston Consulting Group said Asia's wealth management revenue pools will soar faster than any other market worldwide, nearly doubling over the next five years to $52 billion.
""Asian wealth is expanding twice as fast as the rest of the world. This is a compelling opportunity for us,"" said Matos, who took charge of HSBC's newly combined division in February.

""I'm not going to re-do now our goals but what I can say is that in 2021, we will over-deliver our goals on the wealth side,"" he said.
After announcing plans last year to buy out its life insurance joint venture partner in China, HSBC is also keen to gain full control of its asset management company in the country, Matos said.

Short-dated Treasury yields are down 15 basis points from highs hit last week and Chinese October export data have beaten forecasts. 
But despite that backdrop, world stocks are struggling to make headway after hitting record highs. Wall Street futures, so far at least, are in the red. 
The view possibly is that this is a reprieve and it won't be long before the U.S. Federal Reserve starts getting hawkish; October payrolls revealed hefty job additions as well as rising hourly wages. So watch today's slew of Fed speakers, among them Vice-Chair Richard Clarida.
The recent central bank-linked volatility will also sharpen focus on economic data -- Wednesday's U.S. inflation figure is the centrepiece -- forecast to show a further price growth acceleration -- followed Germany's ZEW economic sentiment indicator on Tuesday. 
As for today, excitement is building (yet again!) on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after CEO Elon Musk's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers voted in favour of him offloading 10% of his share holdings. With speculators possibly jumping in to front-run that sale, Frankfurt-listed shares are down 9%.
Finally, the impact of China's ongoing regulatory crackdowns continues to trickle through. A $10 billion hit to SoftBank's Vision fund was driven by its Chinese tech holdings, with its largest asset, e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) losing a third of its value in the second quarter for instance
Later today, infrastructure-linked shares could get a fillip from the passage of the U.S. bill, with oil already up 1%. Finally, as of today, vaccinated non-U.S. citizens can fly to the United States without restrictions -- potentially setting the stage for a boost for airlines and jet fuel prices.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
-China Oct exports beat forecasts, offer buffer to slowing economy
-Some investors have not received Evergrande unit's bond interest due Nov 6, say sources
-UK seems set to invoke emergency measures on NIreland trade
- Higher euro zone inflation temporary 
- Fed speakers: Philadelphia President Patrick Harker, Chicago President Charles Evans, Boston Interim President Kenneth Montgomery, Vice Chair Richard Clarida
- Euro zone finance ministers meet

- US 3-year note auction

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 10:55PM ET</span>","Australia's NAB sees profit leap past estimates, but warns on margin pressures","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) on Tuesday beat earnings estimates as lower pandemic-related provisions helped profit jump more than three-quarters, but at the same time flagged continuing pressure on lending margins and its shares slid.
Australia's second-largest lender posted above-average growth in home and business lending, and said its ""optimism about the future"" was reflected in a dividend of 67 Australian cents a share, more than double last year's payout. [nL4N2P6071
Cash profit of A$6.56 billion ($4.85 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30 beat a Refinitiv estimate of A$6.43 billion.The bank released A$217 million of provisions it had set aside to soak up the COVID-19 pandemic fallout. 
But the extremely low interest rates that have driven a huge rise in home prices and helped the Australian economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic have also hurt bank margins - driving a 28% slide in NAB's markets income for the year.
NAB shares fell 1.5% while its big banking peers were between half and one percent lower. 
""We did see a little bit of margin contraction .. but I think it was a very credible result,"" said Paul Xiradis, chief investment officer at Ausbil Investment Management. ""Reaction initially was taken positively and I think what we are seeing now is a bit of profit-taking."" 
NAB expects to earn more from its interest-earning portfolio this financial year - with markets pricing a hike to Australia's record low interest rates by July - but stiff competition will mean the pressure on margins would continue, it said.
""There's net (margin) headwinds for next year,"" Chief Financial Officer Gary Lennon told analysts in a call.
""This year we managed to essentially net them off ... I think that will be difficult for 2022, but I also don't think it'll be a disaster scenario.""
NAB's net interest margin, a key measure of bank profitability, was 6 basis points lower to 1.71% for the year, largely driven by its holding of low-yielding assets.
Last week, smaller rival  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp fuelled investor anxiety regarding margin pressures facing Australia's big four banks, revealing it had to take a big margin hit in order to growth its mortgage business.
OIL & GAS CAPS
NAB has been targeted by environmental activists for continuing to finance gas projects in Australia. On Tuesday is said it would limit its ""direct"" funding to projects that play a role in national energy security.
The bank also said it would not directly finance greenfield gas extraction projects outside Australia, but would continue to finance integrated liquefied natural gas in Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and other selected regions. 
It would cap oil and gas exposure at $2.4 billion by 2025, and a reduction thereafter to be aligned with goals set out by the International Energy Agency (IEA) by 2050. 
""We've had a number of very strong activist groups say to us, we want you to abide by the IEA. Actually, we think that's the right thing to do and that's what we've actually done,"" Chief Executive Ross McEwan said. 
But on Tuesday activist group Market Forces criticised the bank, saying the ""direct"" reference in its new policies kept a loophole that allowed it to fund the companies running 'dirty' projects even if not the projects themselves.
Extinction Rebellion protesters also targeted the bank's offices in Sydney on Tuesday, writing ""greenwash in progress"" on its windows.
""We have no intention of being involved in any greenwashing whatsoever,"" McEwan told reporters in a call from Melbourne. 

""Our intent is to participate in helping Australia get into a much better position from a carbon emissions perspective.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - More than 20 countries agreed to phase out coal power at the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, but not Japan - a ""leap backwards"" for a country that once led the way on the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The pact was among a raft of pledges made at the COP26 summit in the last week. Japan, the world's third-biggest importer of the dirtiest fossil fuel, declined to sign because it needed to preserve all its options for power generation, officials said.
Critics called that short-sighted, even as new the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has agreed to step up other environmental measures.
""Despite Prime Minister Kishida pledging to direct increased funding to climate finance, we are disappointed that he failed to address the elephant in the room - Japan's dependency on coal,"" said Eric Christian Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Danish fund manager Nordea Asset Management.
The criticism highlights the shift in Japan's circumstances. It led climate change efforts during the 1990s Kyoto Protocol era, but has been burning more coal and other fossil fuels after the Fukushima disaster 10 years ago left many nuclear plants idle. 
GRAPHIC: Japan's electricity mix by source since 1985 https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-POLITICS/jnpweyllqpw/chart.png 
Not phasing out coal has ""positioned Japan to take a leap backwards by signalling thermal power plants can keep running based on new technologies that do not exist,"" said Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at KLP, Norway's largest pension fund.
China, the world's biggest source of climate change-fuelling gases, did not sign the pact and President Xi Jinping did not attend the conference. The country has said it would reduce its use of coal for electricity by 1.8 percent over the next five years.
Japan has pledged billions of dollars for vulnerable countries and to support building infrastructure in Asia for renewables and cleaner-burning fuels. It has also cut targets for coal use and raised those for renewables.
""In Japan, where resources are scarce and the country is surrounded by the sea, there is no single perfect energy source,"" Noboru Takemoto, an industry ministry deputy director, told Reuters. ""For this reason, Japan does not support the statement"" on coal.
The ministry said last year it would accelerate shutdowns of coal-fired plants by 2030, later setting minimum efficiency standards and requiring companies to submit annual updates on phase-outs.
But companies are resisting such plans, a senior executive at a major Japanese generator said. 
""It is being delayed and dragged out because a lot of companies are saying these units still work and are cheaper,"" the executive said, adding that ""a leadership push is needed.""
A Reuters survey of Japanese companies operating old coal power units, including Hokuriku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, showed that most of them have not decided schedules to shut them down. 
Hokuriku Electric plans to shut just one 250-megawatt coal unit in 2024, a spokesperson told Reuters, 
""Our coal-fired thermal power plants play an important role,"" in maintaining stable electricity supplies, the spokesperson said.

Hokkaido Electric, which shut two coal units in 2019, has no closings planned, while the other five companies surveyed said they have no firm proposals. Some are looking at using cleaner fuels, such as ammonia, to burn with coal and other technologies to keep them operating more cleanly.
""For pro-coal corporate Japan, what's more important is business, not the planet,"" said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, a former senior Japanese government official and chief climate change negotiator. ""It's sad to see there is no vision for a better, more sustainable and more competitive Japan.""

U.S. Treasury yields held a climb after a disappointing three-year bill auction. However, the yield on 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities fell to a record low.
Global shares remain near record levels as risk sentiment improves thanks to COVID-19 treatments, easing travel curbs, and the passage of a $550 billion U.S. infrastructure bill.
Key central banks have also hinted that they could gradually begin asset tapering. However, a big risk is that inflationary pressures, caused by bottlenecked supply chains and high energy prices, lasts longer than expected.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 09:31PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Boeing U.S. worker vaccine exemption requests top 11,000 -sources","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - The number of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co employees seeking a vaccine exemption on religious or medical grounds has reached more than 11,000 - or nearly 9% of its U.S. workforce - a level many times higher than executives initially estimated, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The widespread reluctance has left executives scrambling for a strategy that keeps employees safe and complies with President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate for federal contractors, but avoids an exodus of engineering and factory labor, the people said.
The standoff comes as the U.S. planemaker tries to muscle through industrial and certification challenges on its 787, 777X and Starliner spacecraft programs, as well as depressed demand and supply-chain shortages.
Late last week, the White House pushed back to Jan. 4 its deadline for employees at federal contractors to be vaccinated or be tested regularly if they receive exemptions. 
Boeing on Friday then delayed its deadline by about a month to Jan. 4 for employees to take a COVID-19 vaccine, or file an exemption on religious or medical grounds, according to industry sources and a company email seen by Reuters. 
""Compliance remains a condition of employment,"" the internal email said.
The Boeing email also said employees whose requests are approved would be required to wear a face covering, physically distance and frequently test for COVID-19. 
""Anyone who has not received their final dose or been approved for an accommodation, and registered their vaccination status by Jan. 4, will be issued a final warning, and will be expected to promptly come into compliance if they wish to remain employed at Boeing,"" the email said.
A Boeing spokesperson declined to provide a count of vaccination exemption requests.
""Boeing is committed to maintaining a safe working environment for our employees, and advancing the health and safety of our global workforce is fundamental to our values,"" the spokesperson said. 
EXEMPTION REQUESTS
Wearing a face mask on companywide webcasts, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun has urged employees to take a vaccine, two employees said.
Two Boeing insiders said executives initially estimated vaccine resistance from some 2% of workers, a number the company could manage. But by last week, one person familiar with the matter said more than 10,000 employees had filed religious exemptions, and a second person said the number stood at more than 11,300. Another 1,000 or so workers filed a medical exemption, another person said. 
The fact that the vast majority of applications were on religious grounds has thrust one of America's largest employers into the center of a debate about the ethics of probing an employee's religious beliefs.
One person seeking a religious exemption said the company had no right to do so under the law or its own anti-discrimination policies.
Another person, a veteran engineer, said: ""The long list of program issues makes it tough to have company pride. The handling of the vaccine mandate is it for many.""
The issue is hitting other aerospace companies. Around 50 employees at Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp's United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket factory in Decatur, Alabama, have already been placed on unpaid leave, or decided to retire early, after refusing to take a vaccine by a company deadline, two of the sources said.
A third person said ULA executives expect in a worst-case scenario to lose 15% of its roughly 2,600-person workforce, or as many as 390 people.
A ULA spokesperson said so far 1% of its workforce, or roughly 26 people, had permanently left the company. ULA ""decided to require vaccinations to ensure the health and safety of our employees and to align with our U.S. government customer and industry direction,"" the spokesperson said. 

The departures come after ULA executives decided to deny all employee applications for an exemption on religious grounds, deciding it would be too time-consuming to evaluate each case, among other reasons, the third person said. 
""I don't conform to strong-arming or coercion,"" said ULA welder Brent Vandiver, 45, who was among the workers placed on unpaid leave.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department charged a Ukraine national and a Russian in one of the worst ransomware attacks against American targets, court filings showed on Monday.
The latest U.S. actions follow a slew of measures taken to combat a surge in ransomware that has struck several big companies, including an attack on the largest fuel pipeline in the United States that crippled fuel delivery for several days.
An indictment accused Ukrainian Yaroslav Vasinskyi, who was arrested in Poland last month, of breaking into Florida software provider Kaseya over the July 4 weekend.
From there, he and accomplices simultaneously distributed REvil ransomware to as many as 1,500 Kaseya customers, encrypting their data and forcing some to shut down for days, it said.
Vasinskyi is charged with breaking into the victim companies and installing encryption software, developed by the core REvil group. REvil directly handled the ransom negotiations and split the profits with affiliates like Vasinskyi. This model allowed the notorious ransomware gang to extort numerous companies for cryptocurrency.
Kimberly Goody, director of financial crime analysis at security company Mandiant, said targeting affiliates could be more effective than going after the core gangs, because their skills are more prized than encryption software, which is ubiquitous. Some affiliates also work with multiple gangs. 
The arrest was part of a major ongoing sweep against key ransomware figures coordinated by the FBI, Europol and national police organizations throughout Europe, with help from private security companies.
REvil, also involved in an attack against top global meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), was penetrated by the joint operation, Reuters reported previously, and authorities recovered $6 million in ransom payments.
REvil announced it was shutting down last month, as did a rival gang involved in the hack of Colonial Pipeline.
Vasinskyi and another alleged REvil operative, Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, were charged in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas with conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other offenses. 
The Treasury Department said the two face sanctions for their role in ransomware incidents in the United States, as well as a virtual currency exchange called Chatex ""for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors."" 
Latvian and Estonian government agencies were vital to the investigation, the Treasury said. 
""International partnerships can disrupt bad actors,"" former U.S. civilian cyber defense Chris Krebs said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco credited Kaseya for its help in the investigation. ""We are here today because in their darkest hour, Kaseya made the right choice and they decided to work with the FBI... in doing so, we were able to identify and help many victims of this attack.""
The Treasury said more than $200 million in ransom payments were paid in Bitcoin and Monero. 
Vasinskyi, 22, was being held in Poland pending U.S. extradition proceedings, while Polyanin, 28, remains at large. Russia's tolerance of major gangs targeting U.S. critical industry has been a flashpoint in relations with the Biden administration.
President Joe Biden said on Monday that his administration has taken ""important steps to harden"" critical U.S. infrastructure against cyberattacks. ""When I met with President Putin in June, I made clear that the United States would take action to hold cybercriminals accountable. That’s what we have done today"", he said in a statement released by the White House.
Although discussions continue, security experts and most U.S. officials said they had not seen an overall decrease in ransomware attacks. Encryption software used for such attacks is freely available. 
Reuters could not reach legal representatives for the two men accused on Monday, and no attorneys for them were listed in court filings. 
The indictment said the Ukrainian hacker and other conspirators started deploying hacking software around April 2019 and regularly updated and refined it. It said he also laundered money obtained through the extortion scheme.

Europol said earlier on Monday that Romanian authorities on Nov. 4 arrested two other individuals suspected of attacks deploying the REvil ransomware. Officials in South Korea previously arrested three more people associated with REvil and two related strains of ransomeware, Europol added.
Twelve suspects believed to have mounted ransomware attacks against companies or infrastructure in 71 countries were ""targeted"" in raids in Ukraine and Switzerland, Europol said on Friday.

The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq extended their run of all-time closing highs to eight straight sessions, while the blue-chip Dow notched its second consecutive record closing high.
In Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index closed at a record for the third straight day while MSCI's all-country world index closed higher for a six successive session.
A 4.9% decline in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares weighed on the S&P 500. Tesla fell after Chief Executive Elon Musk's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll on whether he should sell about 10% of his stock in the electric automaker.
""The majority voted for him to sell, which effectively signals that he is going to dump stock on the market,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.06%.
World shares have rallied as relatively dovish talk from central bank officials last week and strong U.S. labor data on Friday bolstered investor optimism over solid earnings results on both sides of the Atlantic.
But a tight U.S. labor market along with the dislocation in global supply chains could result in a high reading for consumer prices on Wednesday. Strong inflation likely would rekindle talk of Federal Reserve raising interest rates earlier than expected.
Most U.S. Treasury yields rose after Congress passed a long-delayed $1 trillion infrastructure bill on Saturday, though a broader social safety net plan remains elusive.
Demand was soft for three-year notes at auction.
The benchmark 10-year yield rose 4 basis points at 1.4932%.
Oil prices rose and the United States said it was weighing options to address high prices. Brent crude rose 69 cents to settle up at $83.43 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 66 cents to settle at $81.93 a barrel.
Short-term inflation expectations increased in October, according to survey findings released by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday, and consumers' expectations for how much money they will earn and spend over the next year rose to the highest level in eight years.
Median expectations rose in October to 5.7% for what inflation will be one year from now from 5.3% in September. It was the 12th straight monthly increase and a new high for the survey launched in June 2013. Medium-term expectations for what inflation will be in three years remained unchanged at 4.2% after three consecutive monthly increases. 
The dollar dipped after hitting 15-month highs last week.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.172% to 94.055.
The euro slid 0.01% to $1.1585, while the yen traded remained unchanged at $113.2200. 
Gold rose to a two-month high, bolstered a weaker dollar and persistent inflation concerns. 
U.S. gold futures settled 0.6% higher at $1,828 an ounce.

Cryptocurrencies, which like gold pay no coupon and are seen as a possible hedge against inflation, also rose. Ether hit a record peak and bitcoin jumped to a three-week high.
Bitcoin last rose 4.6% to $66,240.26.

The company, which is looking to accept bitcoin as a payment method, said it was also exploring launching its own cryptocurrency and selling its own brand of popcorn in grocery stores.
""This is the 21st century after all, and it would seem that there may be a real opportunity for AMC in these areas,"" CEO Adam Aron said in a post-earnings call, referring to its foray into NFTs, a type of digital asset which uses blockchain to record the ownership of items such as images and videos. 
But the talks were still preliminary and there was no assurance, he said. 
The world's largest movie-theater company had struggled during the pandemic as attendance came to a standstill, but rising COVID-19 vaccinations, easing curbs and new titles such as ""Shang-Chi"" and ""Black Widow"" are helping fill up cinema halls again.
Still, Aron warned of more challenges ahead and said the company needed to sell more tickets as adjusted core earnings was below pandemic levels.
AMC's shares dropped nearly 5% in extended trading, but have risen over twenty times in value so far this year, largely driven by an army of retail investors coordinating their buying on forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets. 
On a per share basis, it lost 44 cents. Analysts were expecting a 53 cents loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Revenue rose to $763.2 million from $119.5 million, beating estimates of $708.3 million.

Kaisa's troubles come amid concerns about a broadening liquidity crisis in the property sector, with a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in the developers' shares and bonds in recent weeks.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt coming due over the next year of any Chinese developer after embattled China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities.

The six lawmakers, led by Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, offered the measure as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a sweeping defense policy bill that is one of the few pieces of major legislation Congress passes every year.
President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier this year reached an agreement that allows the pipeline that will take Russian gas to Germany to proceed.

Ukraine has long opposed the nearly completed $11 billion project because it will give Moscow the theoretical option to stop routing gas via Ukraine, which would deprive Kyiv of billions of dollars in lucrative transit fees and, it says, imperil its security.
Russia's state energy company, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), and its Western partners have raced to finish the pipeline to send natural gas under the Baltic Sea.

(Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge on Monday ruled United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc can impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on its employees that only provides unpaid leave for workers who are exempted for medical or religious reasons.
U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman in Fort Worth, Texas, rejected arguments by employees that the airline was improperly putting them in an ""impossible position"" by forcing them to choose a vaccine or unpaid leave. 
Pittman was critical of United Airlines' approach toward employees seeking religious exemptions, but said in the end, human resources policy was up the company and no employee was forced to accept a vaccine.
An attorney for the employees did not respond to a request for comment.
The ruling comes as U.S. employers are gearing up to comply with rules issued by the Biden Administration that require companies with at least 100 employees to get their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to regular testing.
Employer mandates, which include exemptions for religious and medical reasons, have generally been upheld by courts. United Airlines was the first major air carrier to impose a vaccine requirement and others have since followed.
United provided around 2,000 exemptions. But employees in roles including pilots, flight attendants and customer service agents had to take unpaid leave until the pandemic ended. 
United said in a statement it was pleased with the ruling and would try to find ""non-customer facing"" roles for exempted employees. If they refuse they will be placed on leave, United said.
The plaintiffs alleged United violated its legal obligations by not accommodating exempted employees as most companies have by allowing them to continue in their role while submitting to regular testing and wearing a mask. They also said they would lose seniority and other benefits if placed on leave.
The company said allowing unvaccinated employees in the workplace would undermine safety of its flights, although Pittman noted the company acknowledged there was almost no chance of COVID-19 outbreaks on its planes.
Pittman said he was ""disturbed"" by United’s seemingly thoughtless approach to its employees’ concerns about taking the vaccine.

""United’s mandate thus reflects an apathy, if not antipathy, for many of its employees’ concerns and a dearth of toleration for those expressing diversity of thought.""
Legal claims relating to exemption accommodations are usually addressed through an administrative process with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission before a lawsuit is filed.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 06:29PM ET</span>",Musk's Twitter poll shaves stock price and raises regulatory questions,"By Subrat Patnaik, Vidya Ranganathan and Chris Prentice
(Reuters) -Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll proposing to sell a tenth of his holdings in the electric carmaker shaved around $60 billion off the company's market value on Monday and raised questions about whether he may have violated his settlement with the U.S. securities regulator again. 
Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $304 billion on Monday, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stake if users of the social media network approved. The poll garnered more than 3.5 million votes, and 57.9% of the people voted in favor.
Musk's poll follows a proposal by U.S. Senate Democrats to tax stocks of billionaires to help finance President Joe Biden's social spending plan and fill a loophole that allowed the rich to indefinitely defer capital gains taxes.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares were last down 4.8% at $1,162.94 after falling as low as $1,133 earlier in the session. Tesla accounted for over 10% of all trading in U.S. companies' stocks, according to Refinitiv data. 
""Elon Musk doesn't like to do things in a conventional way,"" said Russ Mould, director at AJ Bell Investment. ""Holding a poll on Twitter about whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla might seem crazy, but one could say it is normal behavior for him.""
Musk had previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.
""I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,"" Musk wrote along with his poll. ""I was prepared to accept either outcome.""
However, Musk's tweet renews questions about whether he is in compliance with a 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that requires material tweets about the company to be vetted by a lawyer. The SEC, which declined to comment, found Musk violated that agreement in 2019 and tightened it. 
Tesla was not immediately available for comment. 
Philip Moustakis, a former SEC enforcement attorney and counsel at Seward and Kissel LLP in New York, said if Musk had failed to get the tweet cleared then it may have violated the settlement. But if the SEC took action, Musk would have a ""good argument"" if his tweet protected shareholders by cushioning a decline in the stock price. 
“Maybe by making this mini circus out of it Elon actually softened the impact on the share price because he provided an explanation to the public as to why he is selling,"" said Moustakis. 
The billionaire, known for his Twitter banter and lively interactions with followers, was fined $20 million https://reut.rs/3bRI2eu by the SEC for tweets in 2018 and required to step down as chairman.
With his almost cult-like following, Musk has considerable power to move Tesla's stock with his comments, but murky rules make it difficult for regulators to rein him in, Reuters reported in May.
Last month, Tesla became the fifth company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization, joining Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Investors will be closely watching SEC filings from Tesla for any details on Musk's plans. SEC rules give companies four working days to report major events.
TOUGH TO BET AGAINST 
Market participants expected speculators would try to front-run Musk's selling. Including stock options, Musk owns a 23% stake in the world's most valuable car company, with about 170.5 million shares as of June 30.

Still, Tesla is a tough company to bet against. Short interest in Tesla is down by about half since the start of the year as the electric car maker's share price has soared, forcing some investors betting against it to cover their positions.
Some strategists said the selling pressure on the stock may not last. ""Whenever the dust settles, people always step back in, given the number of times in the grand scheme of things this company has had fairly large pullbacks,"" said David Madden, markets analysts at Equiti Capital.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",Explainer - Who could be held liable for deadly Houston concert?,"By Luc Cohen and Thomas Rowe
(Reuters) - More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed and a criminal investigation has been opened after eight people died and hundreds were injured in an apparent crowd surge at Travis Scott's Astroworld festival on Friday.
While details of what led to the deadly concert stampede are still emerging, here is an explanation of who could be held liable for the incident: 
WHAT DO THE LAWSUITS CLAIM? 
At least 14 civil lawsuits have been filed against promoter Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) Inc or a subsidiary, Live Nation Worldwide Inc, according to court records. Of those, 10 name Scott - whose real name is Jacques Webster - as a defendant and one names Drake, a fellow rapper and guest performer.
The lawsuits generally claim that Live Nation acted negligently by failing to create and enforce proper safety protocols, failing to provide adequate security and failing to maintain proper crowd control. The victims were crushed in a chaotic surge near the stage, with some trampled and others unable to breathe.
""Conditions were created and consented to by the festival organizers that caused several stampedes and a crowd compression that resulted in the tragic deaths of eight individuals and the serious injuries of hundreds more,"" according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Houston resident Wasem Abulawi, who the suit says was ""seriously and permanently injured.""
Kristian Paredes, an Austin, Texas, resident who named Scott and Drake as defendants, said Scott had ""incited mayhem or chaos at prior events"" and that Drake was aware of Scott's previous conduct. 
Scott previously pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges related to two separate incidents of encouraging fans to rush the stage, once at a 2015 music festival in Chicago and later at a 2017 concert in Arkansas, local media in both places reported. 
WHAT IS THE LEGAL STANDARD?
The most likely party to face liability would be the concert organizers and promoters who determined the level of security, said C.J. Baker, a Texas injury attorney.
To prevail on a negligence theory, the plaintiffs must show that the defendants knew or should have known that there were actions they could have taken to prevent a foreseeable tragedy, Baker said. 
As for Scott, his previous behavior at concerts could help plaintiffs build a case against him, said Richard Mithoff, a Houston personal injury attorney. 
""You have to know at some point that if you keep pushing it, this is the kind of tragedy that will result,"" Mithoff said.
Scott's record could help plaintiffs establish ""gross negligence,"" meaning an almost total disregard for others' safety, Mithoff said.
WHAT WILL THE LIKELY DEFENSES BE? 
Scott said in a video posted to social media that he ""could just never imagine the severity of the situation.""
He paused his performance https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/travis-scotts-astroworld-concert-pauses-then-restarts-amid-deaths-injuries-2021-11-06 once it was clear people needed medical attention and encouraged the audience to make room for an ambulance that was winding through the crowd, but later finished his set.
Both Live Nation and Scott would likely argue that the surge was sudden and unexpected, Mithoff said. 
""Anytime someone can show that they did everything that a responsible operator would do, and nevertheless there was a tragedy, obviously that's going to cut in their favor,"" Baker said. 
Live Nation said in a statement over the weekend that it was ""heartbroken"" by the incident.
COULD CRIMINAL CHARGES BE FILED?
Houston police have opened a criminal investigation into the incident, and have said they will examine whether security plans were flawed or followed improperly. They are also probing reports that someone in the crowd injected a security guard with drugs. 
The decision to file criminal charges could hinge on whether or not Scott or the organizers stepped in to stop the concert once they knew people were becoming injured or killed, Baker said.

Under Texas law, reckless behavior that causes someone's death is considered manslaughter, according to the state's penal code.
Scott said the Houston police had his ""full support."" Live Nation said in a statement on Monday that it had met with authorities and handed over all video footage of the concert, adding it had offered refunds to attendees and planned to help pay victims' medical expenses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator is calling on the leaders of large banks to more seriously assess and manage their risk to climate change, including exposure to a possible carbon tax.
Michael Hsu, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, said in a speech Monday that bank boards should press their executives for detailed answers on climate change. He suggested management should be able to detail their plans for bank supervisors by next year.
Hsu added that within his office, supervisors are developing a framework for how banks should properly manage climate risk, and he expects to issue guidance by the end of this year. Some of the largest banks overseen by his office include JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Climate change poses significant risks to the financial system. Detailed reports have been published. Eloquent words have been spoken. It is time to convert those words into action,"" he said in his prepared remarks. 
Hsu suggested banks should be able to determine and track their overall risk to climate change, including which counterparties or areas merit closer watch in their portfolios. Another area Hsu said banks should monitor is their exposure to a potential carbon tax. Banks should prepare for ""transition risks"" that come from a policy shift to a low-carbon economy, in addition to physical risks. 

On a more tangible level, Hsu also said banks should be aware of how their physical infrastructure, such as data centers, could be impacted by worsening weather events spurred by climate change.
""Banks increasingly are dependent on third-party vendors for a range of things, including critical services. To the extent that critical service providers are vulnerable to climate change, banks’ abilities to continue critical operations may be affected,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Monday said it has won Meta Platforms Inc as a data center chip customer, sending AMD shares up more than 11% as it cemented some of its gains against  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). 
It also announced a range of new chips aimed at taking on larger rivals such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp in supercomputing markets, as well as smaller competitors, including Ampere Computing in the cloud computing market.
After years of trailing the much larger Intel in the market for x86 processor chips, AMD has steadily gained market share since 2017, when a comeback plan spearheaded by Chief Executive Lisa Su put the company on a course to its present position of having faster chips than Intel's.
AMD now has nearly a quarter of the market for x86 chips, according to Mercury Research. 
After securing Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), as a customer, AMD has deals in place with many of Intel's largest customers. It also has deals with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure.
Christopher Rolland, a semiconductor analyst at Susquehanna International Group, said in a note to investors that AMD appeared to be winning a part of Meta's increased spending as it ramps up plans to build virtual online worlds.
""Investors are now trying to identify the big hardware beneficiaries of this capex, and today’s announcement could suggest AMD is winning a healthy portion,"" Rolland wrote.

The new AMD chip is designed to take on Nvidia's A100 chip, which, along with other chips designed to speed up artificial intelligence, has helped make Nvidia the most valuable U.S.-listed semiconductor company.
AMD said that Oak Ridge National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Tennessee will use the new chip in its ""Frontier"" supercomputing system.

AMD also took aim at smaller rivals. The company announced a new central processor called ""Bergamo"" that will ship in the first half of 2023. The chip will have 128 computing cores, which are useful for cloud computing companies that rent out their chips on a core-by-core basis to outside customers.

""We have seen a drop in DAUs (Daily Active Users) because people have kind of gone from being sheltered at home and moved back to jobs, school and wherever else. So, we have seen a drop in demand for games versus the peak COVID quarters,"" Gibeau said.

Total revenue rose 40% to $704.7 million.
Zynga's quarterly net loss narrowed to $41.7 million, or 4 cents per share, from $122.2 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com —  SmileDirectClub Inc  (NASDAQ:SDC) announced earnings per share of 23 cents on revenue of $137.7 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 14 cents on revenue of $182.51 million.
SmileDirectClub shares have plunged 19% to $4.24 after hours in reaction to the report.
David Katzman, CEO and Chairman of SmileDirectClub, said the company was disappointed with the third-quarter results, which were impacted by ""macroeconomic headwinds"" influencing the spending of its core demographic.

We remain incredibly optimistic and believe that we are well positioned to continue to capture the global opportunity in the rapidly expanding market for clear aligners,” added Katzman.
The company sees Q4 revenue between $120 million and $140 million, well below the $201.75 million consensus. Meanwhile, full-year 2021 revenue is expected to be between $630 million to $650 million.

The company operates through four segments: Commercial Airplanes; Defense, Space & Security; Global Services; and Boeing Capital.
Even though the defense industry does not usually possess high growth prospects, shares of defense companies provide stability thanks to their long-term contracts with governments. Senate appropriators recently unveiled plans for approximately $24 billion in extra military spending—above the president’s $715 billion budget request—for the Fed’s fiscal year 2022. Furthermore, the government’s planned procurement of advanced military equipment to replace aging equipment currently in service, along with technological advances, are expected to accelerate the growth of the defense sector. So, both EADSY and BA should benefit.
EADSY has gained 16.6% in price over the past nine months, while BA has returned 8%. Also, EADSY’s 20.4% gains year-to-date are significantly higher than BA’s 4.9% returns.

So, let’s drive by for a closer look at these companies.Favorable government policies to encourage the transition to a cleaner future, including tax credits for electric vehicle (EV) buyers (and rising oil prices), should speed the shift to EVs in the coming decades.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Biden administration said Monday it is awarding $314 million in grants to 34 states and the District of Columbia to revitalize travel and tourism -- two industries hard hit by COVID-19.
The funding, part of a broader COVID-19 relief package approved by Congress, comes as the United States on Monday lifted travel restrictions on fully vaccinated foreign nationals flying from 33 countries and from tourists crossing land borders from Mexico and Canada that have been in place starting in early 2020.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters in an interview ""travel and tourism is one of the hardest hit industries."" The industry is still struggling but will get a ""shot in the arm"" from the new demand.
She said ""people are anxious to travel... The demand is there. I think we're going to see real increases in travel."" 
The United States was behind much of the world in lifting travel restriction and had Raimondo argued internally for easing them. ""I pounded the table on that. I think it's important for the economy,"" she told Reuters.
International arrivals to the United States fell 75.5% https://www.trade.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Fast%20Facts%202020%20%28April%202021%29.pdf in 2020, while spending by foreign nationals coming to the United States fell 64.3%, by about $150 billion.
Communities along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada were especially hard hit as were places like Florida that cater to foreign tourists.
""Prior to the pandemic, Canadians made hundreds of thousands of cross-border trips – both day trips and overnight stays -- amounting to nearly a billion dollars of annual expenditures"" into New York State,"" said Patrick Kaler, President and CEO of Visit Buffalo Niagara at an event Monday.
United Airlines President Brett Hart said he expects international travel to return to pre-pandmeic levels in 2022, but places like Asia are lagging even as forward bookings for Europe are now surpassing 2019 levels.
""Chicago is a global city, it relies in large measure on tourism,"" Hart said in an interview. ""As people start to come here, we'll see the industry start to pick back up.""
U.S. Travel estimates that declines in international visitation since March 2020 resulted in nearly $300 billion in lost export income and estimates that the international inbound travel segment will not recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.
U.S. Travel says one key need is to fully reopen and resume visitor visa processing at U.S embassies to reduce the backlog for future visitors.
Countries not part of the Visa (NYSE:V) Waiver program are facing ""long wait times in excess of 14 months for a visitor visa appointment,"" U.S. Travel said.

The countries affected by restricted travel that was lifted Monday for fully vaccinated travelers included Britain Ireland, the 26 Schengen Area countries, South Africa, Iran, Brazil, India and China. 
They comprised 17% of all countries worldwide but accounted for a disproportionate 53% of all overseas visitors to the United States in 2019, U.S. Travel said.

The more ambitious $1.75 trillion ""human infrastructure"" package, or Build Back Better Act, is expected to be passed in the House by Thanksgiving.
But the legislative measure would still have to clear the Senate, where Democrats hold a 50-50 majority, and are struggling to unite behind the measures to include in the bill and how best to fund it.

The Antonveneta acquisition on the eve of the global financial crisis is widely blamed for precipitating the demise of the Tuscan bank which Italy had to bail out in 2017. 
As global head of Merrill Lynch's financial institutions team, Orcel had advised Santander (MC:SAN) in the ruinous 71 billion-euro ($82 billion) takeover of ABN Amro the Spanish bank conducted together with Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) and Belgium's  Fortis  (NYSE:FTS).
Before that deal closed, Orcel worked with MPS on buying ABN Amro's Italian business Antonveneta from Santander.
The Tuscan bank paid 9 billion euros, even though Antonveneta had been valued at about 6.6 billion euros in the broader ABN Amro deal just months before.
Appearing on Monday in front of a parliamentary committee after the collapse in talks between UniCredit and Italy's Treasury over a rescue deal for MPS, Orcel said he had only helped MPS raise part of the money it needed to buy Antonveneta.
""I didn't represent MPS in the Antonveneta purchase, and had no role in negotiating that deal,"" he said. ""We played a role in MPS's recapitalisation as global coordinator (of the rights issue) after the acquisition had been decided.""

MPS completed a 5 billion-euro capital increase as part of an 8 billion-euro financing package for the Antonveneta deal.
""Neither I nor the bank I worked for could have provided a fairness opinion given that Antonveneta had been bought and sold in quick succession at very different prices, something which was well highlighted in the prospectus of the capital increase,"" Orcel said. ($1 = 0.8655 euros)

So, let’s discuss these names.The healthcare industry has garnered enviable investor attention since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And because new variants of the virus are still being identified, the healthcare sector should remain in the limelight. In addition, President Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan has provisions to boost the healthcare industry. The medical devices market is evolving rapidly with significant technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) integration and analysts expect the global medical devices market to grow at a 6.3% CAGR by 2027 to hit $625.30 billion.
Against this backdrop, the shares of medical devices maker ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (RWLK) are rallying on a Breakthrough Device Designation from the Food and Drug Administration for one of its devices. However, the company does not possess sufficient fundamental strength to justify the rally. RWLK’s revenue decreased 13.9% year-over-year to $1.44 million in its fiscal second quarter, ended June 30, while its non-GAAP net loss increased 7.7% from the same period last year to $2.87 million. Moreover, RWLK is trading at a stretched valuation. Its 16.48 forward Price/Sales multiple is currently trading 105.1% above the 8.03 industry average.
So we think small-cap medical equipment stocks Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSII), Varex Imaging Corporation (NASDAQ:VREX), and Utah Medical Products, Inc. (UTMD) are better positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

Its products include x86 microprocessors, an accelerated processing unit, chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units, data center and professional GPUs, and development services.
Since last year, the rising demand for semiconductor chips from several industries has created a huge supply/demand imbalance. The resulting increase in prices has been favorable for the semiconductor industry. While huge investments are helping semiconductor manufacturers increase production, the supply shortage may not end anytime soon.

The company outpaced Wall Street’s earnings estimates in its last reported quarter, which has attracted investors’ attention. However, considering its high volatility, is MRO a good energy stock to add to one’s portfolio now? Read on to find out.Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Houston, Tex.-based independent exploration and production company that is engaged primarily in exploring, producing, and marketing crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas and natural gas products. It also owns and operates gathering and treating facilities. The stock has gained 297.9% in price over the past year and 155.9% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $17.07. In addition, shares of MRO are trading well above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating an uptrend. However, it has a 3.08 beta, which indicates that the stock is more volatile than the broader market.
MRO delivered a robust third-quarter earnings report, outpacing the consensus earnings estimate. Its total revenues and other income increased 92.7% year-over-year to $1.45 billion in its fiscal third quarter, ended September 30. Its adjusted net income was $310 million compared to a year-ago loss. The company’s adjusted EPS increased 239.3% year-over-year to $0.39, beating the $0.31 consensus EPS estimate by 25.8%.
Favorable industry trends, with rallying oil and natural gas prices and a sharp rise in demand, have helped the company register significant gains and recover from last year’s losses. Gas prices have surged to a seven-year high of $3.40 per gallon nationally, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) expects Brent crude oil to hit $120 per barrel by June 2022, marking a 45% increase over current levels.

Investing.com — Shares of QuantumScape Corp (NYSE:QS) climbed more than 22% on Monday, to around $37.89. 
The only stock-specific news announced on Monday is that the lithium battery technology company has secured a campus in San Jose, Calif., a place it described as being the future hub of its upcoming manufacturing activities. 
However, the primary reason for its shares rising can be put down to Congress' approval of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill late Friday. 
The bill includes around $7.5 billion worth of funding towards a nationwide network of more than 500,000 EV chargers. There was also funding set aside for low emission vehicles. 
As a result, stocks in the EV space have surged, with QuantumScape, backed by investors such as Volkswagen and Bill Gates, being among the main beneficiaries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are assessing potential ways to boost the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, including improving market data quality, increasing oversight of trading venues and introducing central clearing, according to a Treasury Department-led report published on Monday.
The market for Treasury securities is the most liquid in the world, and the global financial system uses them as a benchmark for asset classes.
But as pandemic fears gripped investors in late February and early March 2020, Treasury market liquidity rapidly deteriorated to 2008 crisis levels, prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve to buy $1.6 trillion of Treasuries to increase stability.
Other disruptions have occurred in ""seemingly more benign 
environments,"" the Treasury said on Monday. 
The Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance, led by the Treasury and comprising the Fed and market regulators, has been exploring overhauling the market to improve its resilience in times of stress.
Monday's report provides an update on areas regulators are exploring, flagging five workstreams. 
These include the role of intermediation by big dealers in the market, which have struggled over the years to keep up with vast Treasury debt issuance. Among the changes could be tweaking a capital rule which banks say constrains their ability to hold and deal in Treasuries. 
The regulators are also assessing whether the timeliness and granularity of market data on positions and transactions needs to be improved; whether some Treasury trades should be put through central clearing houses, improving the risk management around such deals and whether the alternative trading platforms on which many Treasuries trade require increased regulatory scrutiny.
Additionally, the regulators are examining the role of open-ended funds and other investors in the marketplace, and whether runs on those funds led them to sell off Treasuries to meet redemptions and margin calls.

(Reuters) - Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc forecast annual earnings largely above estimates on Monday, as the cosmetics maker benefits from cost cuts to ward off inflation impacts and a revival in demand for its products at airport duty-free stores.
Shares jumped about 13% in morning trade as quarterly net revenue in its prestige segment increased 35.1% to $870.7 million.
Coty, which is grappling with industry-wide supply-chain bottlenecks, said it is managing cost pressures through high-end product launches, price increases, fixed cost cuts and freight under contract.
The Max Factor parent forecast fiscal 2022 adjusted per-share earnings between 19 cents and 23 cents, largely above estimates, after topping expectations for the first quarter.
The company has benefited from its investments in advertising, launch of the fragrances Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia and Burberry Hero and its efforts to rebuild its CoverGirl and Max Factor brands through marketing.
The Kylie Cosmetics seller also said it is optimistic for the holiday season as people return to offices, parties and social events and shoppers, taking trips again, buy more at its duty-free stores following easing of restrictions.
""Travel retail is clearly back. It's not at the level of pre pandemic (but)...this is clearly helping the prestige performance,"" Coty Chief Executive Sue Nabi told Reuters.
Coty also forecast organic sales growth of low to mid-teens percentage growth, above its previous forecast of low-teens growth.
The upbeat forecast comes even as peer  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) Cos Inc cut its sales expectations for the year.
Coty's first-quarter net revenue from continuing operations rose 22% on a reported basis to $1.37 billion.

""Investors should view the F1Q result as evidence the latest turnaround is on track,"" Stifel analysts said.
Separately, the CoverGirl parent said it would sell a 4.7% stake in professional beauty-business Wella to KKR in a $215.7 million deal. Coty will have a 25.9% stake upon close.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's draft rules requiring tech firms to do more to tackle illegal online content could become a global gold standard for a safer online world if they are beefed up, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) whistleblower Frances Haugen told EU lawmakers on Monday.
Haugen, a former Facebook employee who worked as a product manager on the company's civic misinformation team, has accused the social media giant of repeatedly prioritising profit https://reut.rs/3C33JmE over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation. 
Her testimony to a European Parliament committee comes after stops in London, Lisbon and Berlin, and at a time when EU lawmakers are debating whether to firm up the Digital Services Act (DSA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.
""The Digital Services Act that is now before this Parliament has the potential to be a global gold standard,"" Haugen said. 
""It can inspire other countries, including my own, to pursue new rules that would safeguard our democracies but the law has to be strong and its enforcement firm. Otherwise, we will lose this once in a generation opportunity to align the future of technology and democracy,"" she told EU lawmakers.
Haugen said the DSA should be expanded to include online content that violates a platform's terms and conditions, and should force platforms to take responsibility for risks beyond the spread of illegal content such as election manipulation and disinformation about the harms of mental health.
Haugen said news media content should not be excluded from the rules because disinformation campaigns could still game the system by exploiting digital platforms used by publishers.
In a blog post ahead of the EU hearing, Facebook rejected Haugen's claims that it prioritises profits over user safety.
""Contrary to recent claims about our company, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our platform,"" Monika Bickert, vice president of content policy, wrote in the blog.
She said Facebook would spend more than $5 billion this year on safety and security.
EU industry chief Thierry Breton, who met Haugen earlier on Monday, criticised the increased lobbying by technology companies over the draft rules and urged lawmakers fighting over the scope of the DSA to step up their deliberations.

""Speed is everything. We need the DSA/DMA package adopted in the first half of 2022,"" he said after the meeting. 
The DMA, or Digital Markets Act, is the EU's other planned landmark legislation which sets out the do's and don'ts for global technology companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Tesla Inc short sellers were getting a reprieve on Monday, with the stock edging lower as investors braced for chief Elon Musk to sell some of his stake, but it has been a rough year for those betting against the electric car maker's share price.
So far in 2021, short sellers in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - the biggest short in the stock market - have endured $14.2 billion in realized and unrealized losses, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. As of Monday morning, with Tesla shares down nearly 3%, short sellers were up $1.04 billion in such mark-to-market profits on the day, according to S3. 
Even with Monday's decline, Tesla shares have soared about 68% so far this year, leading short sellers to scramble and cover their positions.
The number of Tesla shares shorted stood at 29.5 million, down from 60.6 million at the start of January, S3 said. The short position in Tesla as a percentage of the company's float is down to 3.6% from about 8% at the start of the year.

Still, Tesla's short interest, a measure of the stock's price and number of shares shorted, amounted to nearly $36.1 billion, Dusaniwsky said. That is more than any other stock and twice as large as the next-largest short - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) at $17.6 billion, according to S3.
Monday's fall for Tesla shares came after Musk's proposed sale of about a tenth of his holdings in the electric-car maker following his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>",Euronext to ditch London Stock Exchange for clearing by 2024,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Pan-European exchange Euronext said on Monday it will clear all trades on its newly acquired Italian platform by 2024, helping the European Union cut its reliance on the London Stock Exchange for core financial activities after Brexit.
Currently most Euronext clearing in stocks, derivatives and commodities is handled by the LSE's LCH unit in Paris, which Euronext has not been able to buy outright.
Setting out Euronext's strategic priorities to 2024, its Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah said the group, which operates seven stock markets across Europe, would build on its acquisition of the Milan exchange earlier this year.
Closer ties with LCH, which is ultimately controlled by a company now outside the EU since Brexit, was not as attractive as expanding in-house clearing, Boujnah said. ""The numbers and the strategy were compelling."" 
Exchanges have long sought to have control over clearing to generate more income.
Although Euronext business is only a ""small part"" of LCH in France, the exchange will pay a break-up fee to the LSE when it serves a one-year notice period in 2023 on the current contract, which was due to run until 2027.
The LSE said the loss of business is less than 1% of group revenue and won't affect LCH's repo, credit default swaps and forex clearing in Paris.
Boujnah said it will be up to the LSE to decide if it wants to buy Euronext's 11.1% stake in the Paris arm of LCH.
Moving clearing to Italy is likely to be welcomed by EU policymakers who are seeking to build up the bloc's capital market autonomy and end reliance on the City of London since Brexit, with the LSE's dominance in euro swap clearing a key target for relocation to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt.
VOLUNTARY BORSA LAYOFFS
As bigger rivals like the LSE and New York Stock Exchange owner ICE (NYSE:ICE) push deeper into data, Euronext's new three-year strategy focuses on raising ""ambition"" in largely traditional trading and clearing activities.
Since Britain left the EU last December, Amsterdam has become the biggest stock market in Europe as swathes of trading left London for the bloc, with the Dutch capital also attracting international listings that would otherwise have gone to London, Boujnah said.
Probably no acquisitions are expected in coming months, he added, but he does expect targeted ""high value-added"" deals ""as soon as practicable"" in areas like post-trade, forex, niche data players or corporate services.
Euronext is targeting revenue growth of 3% to 4% a year to 2024 compared with 2020, and average annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 5% to 6%.
Capital expenditure is set to remain unchanged at the rate of 3% to 5% of total revenue.
The pre-tax savings rate by 2024 from the merger with Borsa Italiana has been increased by 67% to 100 million euros, helped by expanding clearing and relocating the core data centre from Britain to Italy from 2022 due to Brexit, Euronext said.
Implementation costs will total 160 million euros ($184.9 million), it added. 
There are concerns in Italy that savings will mean cutting jobs in Milan, but Boujnah told a news conference there will be more people working at Borsa Italiana in three to four years' time than at present.

Some teams in Italy will need ""adjusting"", but this is achievable through voluntary departures, Boujnah said.

Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau pledged last week to improve his French skills and apologized for remarks suggesting he did not need to speak French, Canada's second language, even though the airline is officially bilingual.
Language remains a sensitive issue in mostly French-speaking Quebec, the country's second-most-populous province, where unhappiness over the dominance of English helped the rise of the separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) in the 1970s. 
Rousseau's comments and decision to give a speech almost entirely in English triggered criticism from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and in Montreal, where the airline is headquartered.
Air Canada was not immediately available for comment.
In a letter to Air Canada's board made public on Monday, deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland said Rousseau's ability to communicate in French ""should be incorporated as one of his key performance goals established by the board and play an important part in the board’s evaluation of his annual performance."" 
Freeland, who is also Canada's finance minister, said the ability to communicate in French should become a criterion for promotion to senior positions at the airline.
As part of a pandemic bailout package, Ottawa in April took a stake in Air Canada, which is subject to the country's Official Languages Act and must serve customers in English and French.

Freeland noted in the letter that Ottawa holds about 6% of Air Canada's outstanding stock, and is one of the carrier's largest shareholders.
""This issue raises questions about the quality of governance exercised by the board of Air Canada with respect to the treatment of the French language within the management ranks of the company,"" Freeland wrote.

1231,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>","Options Craze Is Rewriting Rules of VIX, S&P 500 Relationship","(Bloomberg) -- The day-trader obsession with using bullish options to speculate on stocks is doing strange things to the age-old relationship between the U.S. equity market and its benchmark volatility index.
Rather than move in the opposite direction, as the S&P 500 and Cboe Volatility Index have almost always done for three decades, they went up in unison for two weeks -- a stretch of synchronized increases not seen in 14 months.
One common interpretation might be that there is a growing sense of uneasiness as traders bid up the prices of bearish options that in turn lifted the VIX. But an analysis from Susquehanna International Group showed the opposite is true. And that is, investors are flocking to call options to chase gains in stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp., resulting in a spike in upward volatility. The Nasdaq 100 just rose along with the Cboe NDX Volatility Index for three straight weeks, the longest stretch since January 2018. 
“The increase in upside volatility has been even more notable, with historically high call skew now priced into the NDX and many of the individual names,” Christopher Jacobson, a strategist with Susquehanna, wrote in a client note. That’s “reflecting demand for upside exposure and a shift in perceived tail risk incrementally away from the downside tail and toward the upside tail, even as the index and the individual names hit new highs.” 
The pattern speaks to the rampant fear of missing out among traders who have watched stocks melting up amid better-than-expected earnings and a dovish pivot from major central banks. The S&P 500 was flat at 12:15 p.m. in New York, after rising in 16 of the previous 18 sessions, its best run since 1990. The VIX climbed 4.4% to 17.21.
Read: High-Velocity Stock Rally Is Getting Too Hot for Hedge Funds
The Nasdaq 100 lost 0.2%, weighed down by Tesla as Elon Musk’s Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers voted in favor of selling 10% of his stake in a poll set up by the electric-car chief. Still, the tech-heavy gauge just scored two perfect weeks in a row without a single down day, something that has happened only once before -- in 2017.
The Nasdaq 100’s call skew, or a measure of the cost of bullish options, sat at the 98th percentile of its five-year range, according to data compiled by Susquehanna. The pattern of shares up, volatility up is also obvious among some 20 big-tech stocks tracked by Susquehanna. Plotting their implied volatility over time, the firm found that more than half of them saw their call skew sitting in the top 5 percentile of a two-year range.
While other investors may have been behind this options frenzy, one usual player -- the retail crowd -- is surfacing again. Their force is exemplified by a jump in premium spent on small-lot calls, an indicator widely followed as a gauge for retail interest. According to Options Clearing Corp. data compiled by Susquehanna, small-lot call premiums have surged in recent weeks, approaching the peak reached in January. 
The phenomenon was more pronounced among small-cap stocks, noted  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG strategists led by Mandy Xu. The one-month implied volatility on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF increased 1.5 points last week while the underlying cash index rallied 6%. Demand for upside calls was so strong that near-dated options cost more than long-dated ones, causing an inversion not seen in at least one year. 
The rush for calls lifted the overall average daily volume to 30 million contracts last week, the second-highest in history, data compiled by Bloomberg show.   
“The moves have been large and the demand for upside in single stock land insatiable,” said Danny Kirsch, head of options at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “Single stock vols clearly feeding into the index.”

ZURICH (Reuters) - Richemont shareholder Artisan Partners (NYSE:APAM) said on Monday it agreed with activist investor Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) that there was ""significant unrecognised value"" within the luxury goods firm controlled by South African billionaire Johann Rupert.
Artisan's comments come a day after online news platform Miss Tweed and the Financial Times reported that hedge fund Third Point had built a stake in Richemont and was pressing the company to improve its performance.
Richemont and Third Point both declined to comment on the media reports.
""Artisan International Value are long-term investors focused on superior businesses with high returns, a strong balance sheet and management teams with a track record of creating value,"" said David Samra, managing director of Artisan Partners.
""We have been an investor in Richemont for many years and support Mr Rupert in creating value for shareholders. That said, we agree with Third Point that there is significant unrecognised value within Richemont,"" he told Reuters by email.
U.S. fund Artisan holds 1.2% of Richemont, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owns luxury brands including Cartier, Montblanc and Piaget.
Richemont shares underperformed sector leader LVMH last year but have risen more than 50% in 2021. They closed 2.8% higher on Monday, following the Third Point media reports.
Artisan's Samra said the key source of undervaluation for Richemont related to its loss-making e-commerce business.
Richemont has invested heavily in its online distributors business YOOX Net-a-Porter (YNAP), though its continued losses have fuelled speculation about a potential sale.
'PROMISING DEVELOPMENT'
""This is a very interesting, not to say promising, development. Some external pressure is always healthy,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said. 
""In my opinion, Third Point and Artisan Partners are not the only ones to exert pressure in that sense, it's just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. 
Third Point, which is controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, has recently built a large stake in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and called for the oil company to be split up.
While Artisan is not widely considered to be an activist investor, it successfully pushed for management changes at French food company Danone earlier this year.
Vontobel's Bertschy also said Richemont's ownership structure with two classes of shares was not viable nowadays from a corporate governance point of view. 
Richemont has A shares listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and unlisted B shares held by Rupert's Compagnie Financiere Rupert that represent 9.1% of the equity and 50% of the votes.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said he expected YNAP to be sold, ultimately. 

""But I suspect that the company was going to do this anyway and wants it to be profitable before it happens to realize greater value. I am not sure if Third Point is going to be able to accelerate that process,"" Cox said. 
Richemont reports results for the six months to Sept. 30 on Friday.

Addressing a parliamentary hearing on Monday, Orcel said the markets' reaction when UniCredit announced exclusive talks with Italy's Treasury over Monte dei Paschi (MPS) had shown the approach was the right one.
Orcel said he was ""sorry at a personal level"" that the deal had failed, but UniCredit had to ""rigorously apply"" its own risk and accounting models in its due diligence analysis on MPS.
The result - in addition to a valuation gap on some items - was that the capital injection deemed necessary by UniCredit surpassed the Treasury's expectations and none of the solutions UniCredit had proposed to reduce it worked out.

""On the other hand, a smaller recapitalisation ... would have meant for UniCredit to clinch the deal on different terms than ... publicly announced and backed by the bank's stakeholders,"" he said.
""To reach an accord on conditions not in line with what had been agreed would not have been in the interest of UniCredit, its shareholders and, in my opinion, also of the stability of the national banking system.""

So, we believe investors should stay away from meme stocks Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) and Zillow (Z), which lost more than 35% in price last week. Let’s discuss.The meme stock mania commenced earlier this year with the unprecedented short squeeze rally of GameStop Corporation (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). However, last week, during the Boston Investment Conference, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller rang the bubble alarm and warned that meme stocks and many other assets are overpriced, creating concerns among retail traders.
Furthermore, according to the alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative, the average number of daily comments last month on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum fell to half of its last year’s number. Also, the number of active users and funded accounts on a few financial platforms that allow investors to invest in stocks saw a dip in the third quarter.
Given this backdrop, we think investors should stay away from fundamentally weak meme stocks, Peloton Interactive, Inc. (PTON) and Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG), Inc. (Z), because they declined more than 35% in price last week.

Thus, Wall Street analysts expect Snap (SNAP), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Bumble (BMBL) to gain 30% in price or more in the coming months. Read on.Despite the reopening of the economy and resumption of outdoor activities, the demand for social media platforms is increasing rapidly. Social media users have increased 9.9% over the past 12 months to 4.55 billion in October. According to Global WebIndex, 57.6% of the world population now uses social media. Furthermore, the global social networking platforms market is expected to reach $939.68 billion by 2026, registering a 25.4% CAGR .
Social media platforms gained immense popularity during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic because people were forced to physically distance themselves from others and turned to social media as a means of staying socially connected. The adoption of social media platforms is still increasing for entertainment purposes and to stay connected with people worldwide for business, education, health, and other works that can be done virtually. Investors’ interest in social media stocks is evidenced by the Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) 8.2% returns over the past year.
Wall Street analysts expect quality social media stocks  Snap Inc . (NYSE:SNAP), Twitter, Inc. (TWTR), and Bumble Inc. (BMBL) to gain significantly in the near term. Therefore, we think these stocks could be solid additions to one’s watchlist.

Investing.com — Evgo Inc (NASDAQ:EVGO) jumped more than 18% on Monday after a rally saw it hit a high of $12.64 in the first hour of trading. 
The jump in the electric vehicle charging company's shares comes after news that it was awarded numerous grants from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to install high-powered 350 kW DC fast-charging stations.
""EVgo is rapidly expanding our network, including in the Keystone state, thanks in part to the support of the Pennsylvania DEP through its Driving PA Forward program,"" said Jonathan Levy, chief commercial officer at EVgo.
The projects are supported by the latest funding from the Pennsylvania DEP’s Driving PA Forward initiative and complement the three stations and 10 DCFC chargers EVgo has already installed.
EVgo has rapidly expanded in Pennsylvania, with eight site host partners currently having operational stations in the state, from retail centers to pharmacies. Just this year, the company has opened three new sites, with a further three expected to be operational before the end of the year. That brings the total to 20 DCFC chargers. 
“Locations matter massively when it comes to charging, and EVgo’s commitment to siting fast charging where drivers want to stop and shop continues whether you prefer to get your hoagies at Wawa or your MTOs at Sheetz,” added Levy.
Other EV companies have been rallying Monday after U.S. Representatives late Friday approved a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The package provides approximately $7.5 billion to build a network of electric-vehicle charging stations and other electric vehicle initiatives."

CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday she was confident semiconductor chip manufacturers and other companies in the supply chain would voluntarily submit data to the department ahead of today's deadline.
Raimondo told Reuters in an interview she had called within the last two weeks ""all of the CEOs in the supply chain -- including Samsung (KS:005930), TSMC, SK... and all of the CEOs have pledged to me that they will be submitting robust and complete data flows to us. ... So far they've all been cooperative and said they will send us what we've asked for.""
The Commerce Department in September made the request for information to automakers, chip companies and others, saying the information would boost supply-chain transparency, and set a Nov. 8 deadline to respond.
Raimondo had warned in September that she would use compulsory measures to get the data if needed. She said at the time the data ""will give us more information about the supply chain, and the goal is to increase transparency so we can try to identify where the bottlenecks (are) and then predict challenges.""
On Monday, Raimondo said she was ""optimistic,"" and that if the data wasn't ""good enough,"" further action may be needed.
South Korea's trade ministry had expressed reservations on Oct. 6, saying ""the scope of the requested data is vast and a number of operational secrets are included, which is a big concern in South Korea."" 
The White House and Raimondo are urging Congress to approve $52 billion before year-end to boost U.S. chip manufacturing.

Raimondo said it was urgent: ""It's got to happen. It's essential for national security.""
Automakers, including General Motors (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and  Renault  (PA:RENA.PA) have slashed output this year due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs, and other companies, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), have also been impacted.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Reactions to Musk's poll on offloading 10% of Tesla stock,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief Elon Musk said on Saturday he would sell about 10% of his stake in the company, based on votes on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll asking users of the social media network whether he should sell his shares. About 58% voted ""Yes"".
""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" Musk said in a tweet, adding he does not take cash salary or bonus ""from anywhere"", and only has stock.
Musk has previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months that would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes.
Following are comments from analysts:
GRAHAM TANAKA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, TANAKA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
“Selling that number of shares is a lot and he could have sold just one percent if he wanted to generate taxes, but I don’t think it’s up to the public or Twitter to tell Elon Musk what to do. Elon Musk is on a different track than Bill Gates and still has a lot of creativity and value creation for shareholders ahead of him.” 
“We have owned the stock for seven years and we could hold it for another seven years, there’s that much room ahead of them” (in the power generation and battery storage businesses.)
“This will only be a minor fluctuation in the long term.” 
GREG BASSUK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, AXS INVESTMENTS, PORT CHESTER, NEW YORK 
""We see today's activity as more of a very dynamic and very short term reaction to the Musk, Twitter developments. So while there'll be some downward pressure on the Tesla stock on anticipation of Musk selling shares and maybe some others trying to sell shares in advance of that.
""Interestingly, we think that could create a buying opportunity because nothing has changed with respect to the underlying fundamentals and the outlook on Tesla. We're advising investors that to the extent there is a decline through today, tomorrow that potentially could be a very interesting buying opportunity for those who already were bullish on the growth prospects of the company going forward.""
DAVID MADDEN, MARKETS ANALYST AT EQUITI CAPITAL 
""Whenever the dust settles, people always step back in, given the number of times in the grand scheme of things this company has had fairly large pullbacks.""
""While selling stakes will have an immediate impact, the important bit here is the reason for selling stakes which is tax purposes and the market is not too rattled with this reason since there is absolutely no reason to believe that the company is not doing well.""
NICHOLAS HYETT, ANALYST AT HARGREAVES LANSDOWN 
""A large share sale always has the potential to disrupt a company's share price, a simple consequence of supply and demand. However, it shouldn't fundamentally alter Tesla's attractions or valuation, and if well handled the sale shouldn't disrupt the share price over the long term.""
RUSS MOULD, DIRECTOR AT AJ BELL INVESTMENT
""Elon Musk doesn't like to do things in a conventional way and so holding a poll on Twitter about whether he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla might seem crazy, but one could say it is normal behaviour for him.""
""Investors may look at the situation and try and sell before he does, potentially then buying back at a lower price if they still liked the stock. It's also an open invitation for short sellers to place a bet that the shares will fall, generating a profit for them if the stock does decline in price.""
NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT MARKETS.COM
""You could say he just wants to sell some stock now because the valuation has rocketed lately, cash out while the going is good. It's hard to criticise someone for doing that, is it? And rather than get berated by his fans for selling down his holdings, he can say 'look, you told me to do it!'. Either way, Musk was due to start selling soon anyway as he faces a monster tax bill on some of his stock options. And since he takes no salary or bonus from being Tesla CEO (he likes to remind us), the only way to cover would be to sell some shares. Seems fair enough, but does it need all the fintwit showbusiness?""
DANIEL IVES, ANALYST AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES
""Today Musk owns roughly 23% of Tesla and it was viewed by many on the Street that he would sell up to ~5%/6% of his ownership stake, with 10% being a higher amount that could surprise some investors but ultimately its a digestible number we are not overly concerned about. We would rather Musk rip the band-aid off now and sell this portion of stock rather than it lingering over the next year and feeding into any non-fundamental bear thesis on the story.""

Investing.com – Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) climbed more than 7% Monday on landing a contract with Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ:FB) that would allow the former to put its chips in Facebook’s data centers.
The chipmaker held its Accelerated Data Center Premiere event today, when it made the announcement.
AMD has established itself as a serious contender in the market for data center chips, having earlier struck deals with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT).
The company, having proven itself as a worthy competition to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), is now taking on larger rivals such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in supercomputing markets.
The company announced a chip called the MI200 which is an ‘accelerator’ designed to speed up certain tasks like machine learning and AI.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Tennessee will use the new chip in its ‘Frontier’ supercomputing system, AMD said.
The new chip is designed to take on Nvidia's A100 chip, which, along with other chips designed to speed up AI, has helped make it the most valuable U.S.-listed semiconductor company, with a market cap of $765.3 billion, more than four times AMD’s $175.3 billion."

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will not 'politicise' how it supervises foreign clearing houses with 'tit-for-tat' responses to whatever the European Union decides, a senior BoE official said on Monday.
Christina Segal-Knowles, the BoE's executive director for financial market infrastructure, set out in a public consultation paper how the central bank will supervise foreign clearing houses offering their services to customers in Britain.
Britain is waiting to see if the EU will allow investors in the bloc to continue using London-based clearing houses after next June, when temporary, post-Brexit EU market access expires.
Market participants have urged the EU to spell out its intentions as soon as possible to avoid disruption as Brussels piles pressure on banks to shift clearing from London to Frankfurt.
Euro clearing has become highly politicised in Brussels as the bloc seeks to cut reliance on the City of London following Brexit.
Segal-Knowles said Britain has been ""very consistent"" in making sure there will be no ""cliff edge"" in access to Britain for foreign clearers.
""That will continue to be our approach,"" Segal-Knowles told an event held by the Futures Industry Association. How Britain treats foreign clearers will be ""timely, smooth and predictable"", she said.
""It's important that these things are not politicised... We want to make sure that's done in a very technocratic and predictable way, it's not a tit-for-tat,"" she said.

While there was nothing ""enshrined"" in UK rules that cross-border clearing house access must be in both directions, there is a need for Britain to have a trusted relationship with the home authorities of a foreign clearing house, she said.
Relations between Britain and the EU have become strained over Northern Ireland and fishing rights, with the bloc still holding off from ratifying a new 'forum' to discuss cross-border financial regulation almost a year since Britain fully left the bloc last December.

The contract is another fillip for WPP (LON:WPP) which last month raised its annual sales forecast and said that much better than expected third-quarter trading showed a structural change to its growth rate.
WPP will handle Coca-Cola’s media in eight of its nine geographical operating units and the large majority of its creative work, WPP Chief Executive Mark Read said in an email to staff which was sent to media.
""This is among our company’s greatest ever new business achievements, the largest win in decades, and a fantastic endorsement of the new WPP we have built together over the last three years.""
Coca-Cola said it had named Japanese advertising group Dentsu as a complementary media partner in selected markets where it bought distinctive strengths.

France's Publicis Groupe and IPG of the United States had performed very strongly during the review process and agencies of both networks would be included in a strategic roster of firms.
As such, Publicis and IPG would play key roles in an open source creative model which was expected to account for one-third of all marketing work, Coca-Cola said.

(Reuters) - Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) Inc's ad revenue will be in focus when the company reports results on Monday, as investors track the impact of recent changes in Apple's privacy policy on the ""FarmVille"" maker's ability to target ads and attract gamers.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its privacy update in April, making it hard for third-play apps to track iPhone users without their consent and leading to warnings from several social media firms, including Meta Platforms Inc and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP).
""Companies that rely on in-game advertising for most of their revenue are more exposed to the risk of Apple's privacy changes,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis.
""One area that continues to impact all mobile games companies is user acquisition,"" he added.
THE CONTEXT
The ""Empires & Puzzles"" owner, during its second-quarter earnings call, had warned that pressure on ad revenue and bookings would be more pronounced in the third quarter, given the adoption of Apple's privacy changes.
Roughly 85% of iOS users updated to the recent version of the operating system as of July, data from analytics firm Newzoo shows. However, opt-in rate for users to allow tracking was relatively low, according to app monetization specialist Fyber.
The uncertainties looming over the iOS platform could spark a wave of consolidation among mobile gaming companies, analysts said.
""This kind of M&A activity will continue throughout the rest of 2021 and into 2022 as advertisers explore new ways to monetize in-game ads on iOS"", analytics firm GlobalData's gaming analyst Rupantar Guha said.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",Blizzard-hit SoftBank launches buyback after $10 billion Vision Fund loss,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp slumped to a quarterly loss on Monday, as its Vision Fund unit took a $10 billion hit from a decline in the share price of its portfolio companies and as China's regulatory crackdown on tech firms weighed.
Even as the value of its assets slide, the Japanese tech conglomerate said its stock is undervalued and will spend up to 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) buying back nearly 15% of its shares. 
While CEO Masayoshi Son has likened SoftBank to a goose laying ""golden eggs"", Monday's results underscore the headwinds for the investment business.
""We are in the middle of a blizzard,"" Son told a news conference, adding he was ""not proud"" of the Vision Fund's performance in the quarter. Yet he said the company was making steady steps to double the numbers of ""golden eggs"" compared to last year. 
The group's largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. 
Another notable hit was online retailer Coupang, which gave up a third of its value. 
""The strategy of let's create the perception of enhanced value by taking things public hasn't really worked this year,"" Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry said.
""CRUDE LEVER"" 
Son says the change in the value of the group's assets rather than profit is the primary measure by which performance should be gauged. Asset values plunged by 23% to $187 billion in the three months to September. 
While SoftBank shares trade at around a 50% discount, lower than a record gap that triggered the launch of an eventual 2.5 trillion yen buyback last year, the conglomerate has the capital to do repurchases now, Son said. 
""I am excited because we are discounted compared to our true strength,"" Son said.
Investors have been calling for a buyback to enhance returns. Repurchased shares will be retired, a move that lowers the bar for Son, SoftBank's top shareholder, to potentially launch a management buyout. 
""The buyback gives them a crude lever to influence the discount the shares trade at,"" said Boodry, adding that the more gradual pace may reduce share price volatility. 
Future upside for the Vision Fund includes its India portfolio with ride-hailer Ola and logistics firm Delhivery targeting listings.
""The pipeline is very robust,"" Navneet Govil, Vision Fund's chief financial officer, told Reuters in an interview. 
The planned listing of Southeast Asian ride-hailer Grab via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) will provide further valuation gain, Govil said. 
The group's net loss of 398 billion yen ($3.5 billion) compared to a profit of 628 billion yen a year earlier. Vision Fund's investment loss totalled 1.167 trillion yen.
SoftBank has been raising capital by trimming stakes in companies such as ride-hailer Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and food delivery firm DoorDash following the expiry of lock-up periods. 
The group has returned $9.8 billion to investors and is focusing on investing through its second Vision Fund that has $40 billion in committed capital from SoftBank and Son himself.
The second fund had invested $33.5 billion in 157 startups at the end of the quarter. Eight of those firms have already listed. 
Son said he lost 150 billion yen through his personal investment in SB Northstar, the group's trading arm which bet on derivatives and whose activities have been wound down. 
The billionaire is also investing his own money in SoftBank's Latin American funds, the company said. 
""It's tough taking risk on yourself,"" said Son, saying he is willing to take a chance as SoftBank's ""captain"". 

SoftBank shares, which have lost around a quarter this year, closed down 0.77% at 6,161 yen ahead of earnings on Monday.

Investing.com – Stocks of U.S.-listed Chinese education companies rose Monday after The Wall Street Journal reported that China planned to issue more than a dozen licenses that would allow them to resume after-school tutoring.
Gaotu Techedu stock (NYSE:GOTU) rallied 12%, New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU) surged 6.6% and TAL Education (NYSE:TAL) rose 6%.
The policy will bring to an end the uncertainty that has engulfed China’s edtech sector and erased billions of dollars in their stock values since the news broke more than four months back that the companies will be asked to go non-profit.
According to the WSJ report, tutoring companies including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)-backed Yuanfudao have discussed with regulators their request to be permitted to resume tutoring to students of ninth grade and below.
Under the proposed licensing regime, companies will be required to operate after-school tutoring on a non-profit basis while being allowed to make a profit elsewhere, such as by tutoring adults for professional exams. As per the report, the government will also place a cap on the price companies can charge for each after-school class.
Since June when there was no news of tightening of rules, Gaotu has lost over 80% of its value. Similarly, Tal Education trades around one-tenth of its value in June and New Oriental trades at about one-fifth.

Investing.com — Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares rose more than 3% on Monday after several analysts increased their price targets on the stock as transatlantic travel demand gathers pace.
Last Thursday, the company posted its third quarter earnings, and the stock rose nearly 13%. 
Piper Sandler, Susquehanna, Loop Capital, Wells Fargo, and DA Davidson all raised price targets on Monday, with Airbnb's earnings taken into consideration.
However, the key point in most notes was the rise in travel demand, with the U.S. now opening up to vaccinated travelers by airplane from around the world, and in particular, from the U.K. and Europe. Susquehanna analyst Scott Devitt described Airbnb as being a must-own stock for the recovery.
After nearly 20 months, the U.S. today lifted a ban on international travelers from more than 30 countries, which will surely provide a rise in Airbnb demand. So it's no wonder that the stock is under analysts' spotlight once more. 
Piper Sandler increased Airbnb's price target to $215 from $175, Susquehanna increased the price target to $235 from $200, Loop Capital lifted it to $250 from $205, Wells Fargo increased it to $225 from $210 and DA Davidson boosted it by $56 to $230.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>",Brazil's Embraer unveils family of green concept planes,"By Gabriel Araujo and Tim Hepher
SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Brazil's Embraer on Monday became the latest planemaker to unveil concepts for environmentally friendly air travel, including a dual-fuelled propellor plane, as aviation faces mounting pressure to tackle global warming.
The world's third-largest planemaker unveiled the proposals to coincide with the COP26 climate gathering in Glasgow, calling them a ""building block"" towards reaching aviation industry targets of net-zero emissions by 2050.
Environmental groups have said the goals are too timid.
In a virtual presentation, Embraer outlined four concepts grouped under the family ""Energia"" with various combinations of range and technology like fuel cells or hydrogen power, adding it sees a potential maret for some 4,000 airplanes.
The designs include a nine-seat hybrid-electric plane capable of reducing carbon emissions by 50% before 2030 and a shorter-range all-electric equivalent, also for nine passengers, that would have no carbon emissions and be ready by 2035.
The two nine-seaters could be flown by a single pilot.
Also on the menu is a 19-seater powered by hydrogen-based fuel cells by 2035 and a 35-50-seat plane by 2040 designed to use hydrogen on short routes, backed up by sustainable aviation fuel for extra range and emergency reserves. 
Embraer said its designs - the result of work kept under wraps for two years - would address a gap between the new eVTOL or flying-taxi industry and 50-seater turboprops or small jets.
It believes small regional planes will be the first to embrace breakthrough technologies like hydrogen, ahead of the bigger narrowbody commercial jetliners. But experts say such schemes will seed technology that may become more widespread.
""It's a segment where we believe a lot of opportunities lie ahead,"" Arjan Meijer, chief executive of Embraer Commercial Aviation, told Reuters in an interview.
Embraer, which was forced last year to abandon plans to merge its commercial unit with Boeing (NYSE:BA) at the onset of the COVID crisis, said it was open to partnerships to develop the planes.
The concepts, if developed, would be competing in what has historically been a volatile niche of the aircraft industry.
Marketing vice-president Rodrigo Silva e Souza said the rejigging of global supply chains and a trend towards working remotely would put greater emphasis on flying short distances. 
Embraer is pressing ahead with plans for smaller eVTOL or electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft through a spin-off called Eve Urban Air Mobility.
Embraer and other traditional aerospace manufacturers face a slew of startups exploring the all-electric flying taxis.

""I am not convinced of the performance goals"" of startups, Meijer told the online briefing.
Embraer also continues to seek financial or industrial partners to help launch a proposed new turboprop, Meijer told Reuters. It has hinted at a possible decision early next year.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>","Automakers say magnesium shortage not a problem, for now","By Victoria Waldersee and Pratima Desai
BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - European automakers reeling from a global chip shortage have in recent days hastened to assure shareholders that shortages of magnesium are not, for now, a risk to their production plans.
However, car part suppliers and industry associations warn that if production in China, which accounts for 85% of global magnesium supply, does not pick up pace soon, automakers could be facing significant shortfalls of the material.
Car makers do not ordinarily purchase large quantities of magnesium themselves. But part manufacturers supplying automakers with key components are heavily reliant on magnesium, which can be used by itself or combined with aluminium to reduce the weight of cars.
Making vehicles lighter is particularly useful for extending the driving range of electric vehicles, crucial for Europe's energy transition plans.
Chip shortages have already extended delivery times for new cars, sometimes up to a year. Without a speedy recovery in China's magnesium exports those queues could lengthen, an auto industry source said.
Auto firms Stellantis and BMW say they do not see an imminent problem with supplies. Others in the sector say their inventories and magnesium already in transit will see them through to early 2022. 
But Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s head of purchasing in an earnings call said a shortage was expected.
""We cannot forecast right now if the shortage on magnesium, which will happen definitely according to planning, will be bigger than the semiconductor shortage,"" Volkswagen's Murat Aksel said. 
China's magnesium output is about 50% of normal levels, industry sources said, as soaring coal prices and energy rationing prompted smelters to cut or shut down operations.
China has allowed some magnesium producers to resume output, but not by enough to significantly ease the shortage. Prices have retreated from record highs but they are still more than double the levels in January.
""We are very concerned this is going to impact us in a couple of weeks,"" Jonathan O'Riordan, international trade director of Europe's automobile manufacturer association ACEA, told Reuters. 
Germany's ZF, which uses magnesium for gearboxes and steering wheels, told Reuters it was seeking new sources of magnesium from other countries, but that offsetting the loss of Chinese supply was limited given the size of its market share.

""It's the calm before the storm,"" said Teresa Schad, a spokesperson for Germany's metal association, WV Metalle.

Shares of the company were up about 1.2% on the update as the data is expected to support the ongoing regulatory review to extend therapy's use in preventing COVID-19 in people who are not exposed to the virus. 
The antibody therapy, REGEN-COV, is currently authorized in the United States to treat people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for prevention of infection in those exposed to infected individuals, and others at high risk of exposure in settings such as nursing homes or prisons. 
The extended authorization could help boost sales of Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN)'s antibody cocktail, in the face of competition from oral COVID-19 pills such as those being developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co.
Data showed that Regeneron's drug has the potential to provide long-lasting immunity from COVID-19 infection, said Myron Cohen, who leads monoclonal antibody efforts for the U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored COVID Prevention Network, making it particularly helpful for immunocompromised people and those unresponsive to vaccines.
""With infections still occurring despite widespread vaccination, the immunocompromised face an ongoing risk of encountering the virus during their daily lives,"" Regeneron Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said. 

During the 8-month assessment period, there were no hospitalizations for COVID-19 in the REGEN-COV group, but in the placebo group 6 such incidents were recorded, Regeneron said. 
Regeneron said researchers were able to demonstrate the impact of its drug even after the immediate risk of household infection had subsided. It intends to rapidly share the additional data with regulatory authorities.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 10:23AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Colombia oil theft surges as smuggled gasoline dries up, data show","By Oliver Griffin
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Theft from oil pipelines in Colombia is booming as criminal gangs look to replace dwindling supplies of smuggled Venezuelan gasoline for use in the drug trade, as shown by data seen by Reuters from oil-pipeline operator Cenit and tax authorities. 
Gasoline is a key component in making cocaine but there have been shortages of the fuel in Venezuela during that country's social and economic crisis. So criminal groups in Colombia are tapping pipelines for ever more crude, which they must later refine. Colombian crime gangs also send some of that artisanal fuel to Venezuela, a reversal of historic smuggling patterns.
""Now it's switched,"" Yessica Prieto, project and investigations director of Colombian energy advocacy group Crudo Transparente, told Reuters. ""It's ... Colombian mafias, or criminal groups, who are stealing Colombian crude, refining it illegally - obviously artisanally - and which crosses the border to Venezuela.""
Theft of crude in Colombia - mainly from the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline near the Venezuelan border - hit at least a six-year high in the first half of 2021, according to data from pipeline operator Cenit, a subsidiary of Colombia's majority state-owned oil company, Ecopetrol.
Stolen oil is processed in clandestine refineries and turned into a rudimentary gasoline known as ""pategrillo"" or ""cricket's foot"" - so-called for its green color - that is used in cocaine production, police and analysts said. 
An average of 3,299 barrels of oil were being stolen per day in Colombia through June 30, up from 1,796 barrels per day in 2016, according to Cenit.
Compared to 2020, when an average of 2,744 barrels of crude were stolen each day, oil theft in Colombia rose by a fifth during the first half of this year.
While oil theft has surged, the quantity of gasoline apprehended under suspicion of being smuggled has fallen sharply over the same period, according to data from Colombia's DIAN tax authority seen by Reuters.
A peak of 694,894 gallons of fuel were apprehended by authorities in five provinces along the border with Venezuela during 2017.
That figure fell to 107,616 gallons by 2020, according to the DIAN. In the first half of 2021, just 18,484 gallons of fuel were apprehended.
The DIAN attributed the fall in contraband fuel to turmoil in Venezuela, where oil production and refining has fallen sharply, and the success of anti-smuggling legislation. 
Venezuela's economic crisis ""has driven the flow of hydrocarbons from Colombia to Venezuela,"" the DIAN said in an email.
The overwhelming majority of oil theft occurs along the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, with 2,430 barrels of crude stolen per day during the first half of 2021.
In 2020, 2,008 barrels of oil were stolen each day from the pipeline, Cenit said. 
Once refined, the stolen crude is used to make coca paste, a precursor to cocaine. Leaves of coca are mixed with gasoline to extract certain plant compounds, with gallons of fuel required to make just one kilo.
Fuel may also be sent to Venezuela or used for machines at illegal mining sites, Colombia's police said.
""The main use is to process plant compounds during cocaine production,"" Brigadier General Jesus Alejandro Barrera, director of Colombia's rural police, told Reuters. 

""Once (criminal groups) saw they couldn't bring gasoline directly from Venezuela, they said 'let's use this pategrillo as an ingredient to make these compounds.'""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department will announce on Monday it is offering an additional $184 million in payroll assistance to 158 more aviation manufacturing businesses.
In September, the department offered $482.3 million to 313 aviation manufacturing businesses. The new offers include $17.5 million to BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Controls and about $13 million to both Airbus's U.S arm and Dassault Falcon Jet Corp, according to a release seen by Reuters.
The department said it will reopen the application process a final time requiring applications by Dec. 13. 
Congress earlier this year created a $3 billion aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program that will cover up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for as long as six months.
The offer requires companies to commit to not conducting furloughs without employee consent or laying off employees covered by subsidies during the six-month period.
Companies eligible include aircraft, engine, propeller or component manufacturers and companies that repair or overhaul airplanes and parts.
To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or have experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the funding ""will save thousands of manufacturing jobs, support hundreds of small businesses, and help keep America’s aviation industry strong.""
Many of the recipients are small businesses. Of the 469 companies receiving funds in the two rounds, 298 of them, or 63%, had fewer than 100 employees at the beginning of April 2020.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Asset management firm Blue Owl, which specializes in buying stakes in alternative money managers and direct lending, is hiring an executive from Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX)'s hedge fund and private equity stakes business.
Marc Pillemer will join New York-headquartered Blue Owl in January as a managing director and senior member of the investment team, executives told Reuters.
He spent the last seven years at Blackstone, where he was a managing director, and worked at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) before that.
""Marc is an amazing talent in this industry and it will be great to have him on the team,"" Blue Owl co-president Michael Rees said.
Blue Owl, Blackstone and Goldman are the three largest players in the so-called GP stakes business and all recently raised billions of dollars for new funds with Blue Owl's Fund V targeting $9 billion in assets.
""The exciting growth trends in this industry require more and more capital,"" Rees said, adding: ""These aren't cash out trades. This is growth capital.""
Blue Owl has $63 billion in assets and generates 97% of its management fees from permanent capital vehicles.
It was formed earlier this year when Dyal Capital Partners and Owl Rock Capital (NYSE:ORCC) merged and Blue Owl opted to go public with Altimar Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition vehicle backed by HPS Investment Partners. Within Blue Owl, the Dyal name is still being used for the stakes business.
Blue Owl's stock price has surged roughly 70% since it was turned into a publicly traded company in May.
Since its founding in 2011, Dyal has bought 53 minority stakes including in private equity firms Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners and more recently in Iconiq Capital, a multi-family office that manages money for Mark Zuckerberg.
Blackstone has seen turnover this year with Scott Soussa, who co-headed the hedge fund and private equity stakes business, leaving for Angelo Gordon, while Melvin Hibberd is joining Hunter Point Capital.

(Reuters) - Newly listed secondhand apparel retailers ThredUp and Poshmark are expected to forecast strong end-of-year sales as a shortage of new clothing at stores pushes shoppers to consider thrifting as an option to fill their holiday shopping bags.
Apparel had the highest online out-of-stock levels among U.S. retail sectors in the run-up to the holiday season, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics said in October.
Those shortages are expected to drive more people to secondhand clothing companies such as Poshmark Inc, ThredUp Inc and ReaReal, which are not as affected by global supply chain issues as they get their stock mainly from the closets of American households. 
""Inventory is scarce right now. Consumers are going to shop where they find inventory to make sure they have things in time for the holidays,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
THE CONTEXT
Secondhand retailers have seen a blistering pace of growth over the last few years as eco-conscious Gen Z and millennial consumers increasingly find it fashionable to buy used products and cut back on their environmental footprint. 
(GRAPHIC: Thrifting boom - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-RETAIL/egvbkmgexpq/chart.png) 
The size of the market is only expected to get bigger. More than a third of shoppers say they are likely to buy second-hand apparel this holiday season, with that number rising to 50% for people under the age of 40, according to a survey of U.S. shoppers conducted by Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Holiday-quarter sales are expected to rise 22.9% for Poshmark and 53.3% for RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL), according to IBES data from Refinitiv
* For the reporting quarter, Poshmark is expected to report revenue of $82.7 million, while RealReal is expected to report $113.3 million and ThredUp $61.8 million

The American movie theater chain will show the movies at over 200 of its locations in the United States. The films will come from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Studios, and Lucasfilm.
There will be surprise showings of the four films to celebrate the second anniversary of the at-home streaming platform Disney+. AMC, the biggest movie theater chain, will be hoping it can attract movie watchers back to cinemas as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to fade.

A new network, to be launched by the end of the year, would also allow customers to manage all their bank accounts and complete transfers with any bank through a single application, the statement said. 
""Customers will be able through the new network to complete transfers within a few seconds, on weekdays and during official holidays using various electronic payment tools issued by Egyptian banks,"" central bank deputy governor Rami Aboul Naga said in the statement.
Egypt over the last two years has introduced a series of new legislation and regulatory changes designed to unleash fintech investments and change the way the country's largely unbanked citizens do business.
Payments firms, which in Egypt work in association with banks, also stand to benefit greatly from the new regulations, said Ahmed Mohsen, a cofounder of Egyptian lending and payments start-up MNT-Halan.
""It is a real game changer,"" he said.

The change will allow a whole new series of functions, including money transfers with an IPN (instant payment network) or phone number, and the topping up of prepaid cards and electronic wallets, he said.
""Right now you cannot do peer-to-peer transfers across cards, (and) I need to do an ACH (automated clearing house) to move money from one bank account to another, and that would need all your banking details,"" Mohsen said. ""And I cannot top up my prepaid card using my bank account.""

Investing.com – Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock (NASDAQ:REGN) rose 1% on Monday after the company said a single dose of its antibody cocktail significantly reduces the risk of contracting Covid-19.
Results of a late-stage trial showed that antibody therapy, Regen-Cov, has the potential to provide long-lasting immunity against the infection, said Myron Cohen, who heads monoclonal antibody efforts for the U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored Covid Prevention Network.
The trial, which was fully enrolled in early 2021, allowed participants to become vaccinated if they wished once the primary efficacy treatment period (month 1) was complete.
Regen-Cov is currently authorized in the U.S. to treat people who are at high risk of serious consequences from Covid-19 who are either already infected (but not hospitalized) or in certain post-exposure settings as a precaution. It is not authorized as a substitute for vaccination against Covid in the U.S.
Regeneron is collaborating with Roche to increase global supply of the antibody cocktail, with the Swiss company responsible for development and distribution outside the U.S."
1268,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>",Scope for U.S. 'taper tantrum' sequel reignites capital debate,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Potentially destabilizing disruptions in U.S. Treasuries as the Federal Reserve pares bond buying have rekindled calls for it to change a capital rule which banks say discourages them from supporting the market.
Bond market volatility increased in late October, fueling fears it may again seize up as it did in March 2020 and during 2013's ""taper tantrum"" when traders dumped Treasuries ahead of the Fed reducing bond purchases.
Moves in the Treasury market, the deepest and most liquid market in the world, can have far-reaching ramifications as it sits at the heart of the global financial system, acting as a benchmark for asset classes globally and enabling the U.S. dollar to operate as the world's reserve currency.
Known as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), the rule in question was introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis as a backstop to reinforce primary capital rules.
But as COVID-19 government stimulus checks and the Fed's massive bond-buying program inundated banks with deposits last year, some have been constrained by the SLR, which requires them to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
To incentivize them to keep lending and continue dealing in the stricken Treasury market, the Fed exempted deposits lenders hold with the central bank, known as reserves, and U.S. Treasuries from the ratio for a year.
The Fed let that exemption expire in March, saying it would launch a formal review. But it has yet to publish a proposed rule change, raising concerns in some quarters just as the central bank's board faces a major reshuffle.
""Banking agencies should take action to fix the requirements now, rather than looking back with regret in the wake of significant Treasury market volatility,"" the Bank Policy Institute, which represents big banks, warned in a blog.
""If tapering or a debt-ceiling crisis happen before changes to leverage ratios are made, there is heightened risk of another episode of Treasury market dysfunction,"" it added. 
Some of the biggest banks which are critical dealers in the market, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are facing SLR limits, Standard & Poor's analysts say. 
While tapering should reduce the upward pressure on bank reserves, it could continue until the Fed ends its bond-buying program, which is not expected until the middle of 2022.
Fed chair Jerome Powell told a press briefing last week that the central bank was reviewing the SLR, including as part of a wider Treasury market overhaul it is discussing with other top regulators, but did not comment on the rule change proposal.
""It's important that we have a liquid Treasury market...and we need to do those things that enable that, while also assuring safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions."" 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
The SLR was created to augment rules which call for capital based on the riskiness of an asset. But risk-adjusted rules can be circumvented and failed to fully protect the system from the complex products that contributed to the financial crisis.
However, banks say it makes no sense for the SLR to require the same ratio of capital for essentially risk-free assets such as Treasuries and reserves as for loans to companies. 
As a result, the SLR can have the unintended consequence of hurting liquidity in the Treasury market by making it expensive to hold bonds on their books, say banks.
""If it becomes a binding constraint it can have some perverse effects like disincentivizing activity in low-risk markets,"" Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the Financial Services Forum, which represents big banks, said. 
But the market is not facing a ""doomsday scenario"", he added.
Some observers say it might take another market convulsion similar to 2020 for the Fed to again make exemptions.
Changing the rule is a political hot potato as progressive Senate Democrats say to do so would be a giveaway to Wall Street and would increase systemic risk.
""We believe the Federal Reserve has not advanced a proposal to fix the SLR for political reasons,"" Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group wrote recently. 
One potential fix, Seiberg said, is for the Fed to exempt reserves but increase the SLR's overall requirement enough to offset the reduction. That might satisfy progressives by leaving the total required capital the same as before.

But that is not likely to happen until the Senate confirms a new Fed chair and vice chair for supervision, which could drag the issue into 2023. 
""Big banks will have to cope with a binding leverage constraint for many quarters to come,"" Seiberg wrote.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Monday, supported by the passage of the Democrats' infrastructure spending bill late on Friday, and by fresh reassurances that there will be no interest rate hikes for another year. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 143 points, or 0.4% at 36,471 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. 
Earlier, Richard Clarida, the outgoing vice-chair of the Federal Reserve, said in a speech that the benchmarks for raising interest rates may only be hit late in 2022. That contrasted with comments from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he thought two rate hikes will be necesary already next year. Clarida is generally thought to have more influence on the Fed's thinking, but his term expires at the end of January next year.
There will be a flurry of speeches from senior Fed officials on Monday, including from Chairman Jerome Powell at 10:30 AM ET. They'll be hitting a market that has mostly regained its composure about the inflation outlook as the monthly dynamic of price increases has started to weaken. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield has settled back down into a range under 1.50% after briefily touching 1.70% last month.
Year-on-year inflation rates continue to run at multiyear highs, however, and may hit their highest since the 1990s later this week when U.S. consumer price inflation numbers for October are released. 
Early trading in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was busy, the shares falling 4.4% after CEO Elon Musk flagged his intention to sell some $20 billion in stock to meet a looming tax bill, triggered by the exercising of his stock options.
Tesla will be one beneficiary, at the margins, of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that is now on President Joe Biden's desk for signing. The bill provides for, among other things, $7.5 billion to roll out charging infrastructure for electric vehicles to accelerate the energy transition. There was a much bigger impact on small-cap charging companies Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK), and ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT), which rose 8.5% and 9.2% respectively to their highest in over three months.
There were also chunky gains for heavy equipment and engineering companies:  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock rose 2.7%, while KBR (NYSE:KBR) stock rose 2.6% to a new all-time high. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stock rose 5.7%. 
Elsewhere, travel stocks were again broadly supported by confidence that new treatments for Covid-19 will help ensure that economies don't have to shut down again this winter, despite the fact that the new infection trend has stopped improving in the U.S. and is back at or above previous record highs in parts of Europe. Sentiment was supported by the resumption of inbound transatlantic passenger flights to the U.S. after a gap of over a year. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 1.4%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 3.0% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 2.2%.  Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock rose 4.3% to its highest since March.

The move is also seen easing pressure from activist shareholders who now make up a large portion of the sprawling Japanese company's investor base. A conglomerate discount refers to investors' tendency to value a diversified group of businesses at less than the sum of the group's parts.
The plan calls for Toshiba to split the three businesses and list each of the companies in a few years, the spokesperson said. The move is one strategic option being considered, the company said in a statement.

Toshiba is in the process of drawing up a new mid-term plan to boost corporate value. The Nikkei newspaper earlier reported that Toshiba would aim to be split by 2023.

The deal comes as a pandemic-driven shift to remote working and a rise in cyber attacks have spurred demand for antivirus and digital security software.
The company, founded by U.S. technology entrepreneur John McAfee in 1987, was the first to bring to market a commercial antivirus. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) bought it in 2011, when McAfee himself no longer had any involvement. 
In the last few years, McAfee has strengthened its main cybersecurity software business that focuses on retail customers via price increases, new partner programs and good retention rates.
As part of the transaction, the investor group will acquire all outstanding shares of McAfee common stock for $26 per share in an all-cash deal that values McAfee at about $12 billion on an equity basis.
The purchase price represents a premium of 22.6% over McAfee's closing share price of $21.21 on Nov. 4, the last trading day before the Wall Street Journal reported about the deal talks.
Shares, of the San Jose, California-based company, which made its market debut last year, were down more than 3% at $25.36 in premarket trading, slightly below the offer price.

DETROIT (Reuters) - A union-affiliated pension fund advisor pressing Rivian on human rights and environment concerns in the electric vehicle startup's battery supply chain ahead of a blockbuster initial public offering said on Monday the company's response fell short of expectations.
SOC Investment Group Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger said he was disappointed in the lack of substance in the Irvine, California-based company's Oct. 29 response to earlier concerns the fund manager raised. SOC provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.
""They sent us a lot of words, but it's really raising a lot of questions and we expect more substance than aspirations,"" Waizenegger said in an interview. ""It's particularly lacking on firm commitments to address critical environmental and human rights risks."" 
As issues of environmental, social and corporate governance take on growing importance with investors, automakers have come under pressure to prove that such minerals as lithium and cobalt for their EV batteries are sourced without human rights abuses. 
Rivian, backed by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, on Friday raised the offer price for the shares in its IPO, aiming for a valuation of as much as $65 billion. It now expects to raise nearly $10 billion on Tuesday.
In an Oct. 29 response to SOC, board member Rose Marcario said Rivian was committed to ethical and sustainable growth in the EV space.
""We have already taken extensive measures to protect the environment and human welfare in the course of our business operations; we have always understood that we must grow our policies as we grow our company; and we are intent on setting new industry standards for human rights and environmental diligence,"" she said. 
Marcario cited Rivian's plan to put 1% of equity in an environmental program aimed at helping address climate change and preserving wildlands and waterways, its intent to be climate neutral by 2032 for all emissions, a promise to release a full impact report in early 2023, a commitment by its battery supplier Samsung (KS:005930) SDI not to use deep seabed mining, Rivian's supplier code of conduct, and more. 
SOC in an Oct. 20 letter called on Rivian to adopt policies to identify and prevent human rights risks and environmental impacts through its supply chain based on United Nations guiding principles for businesses.
In Monday's letter, Waizenegger said Rivian's supplier code of conduct was not publicly available, its position on deep seabed mining needed to be clarified, the startup needed to commit to disclosures around its efforts, and the fund manager was concerned Rivian's board might not be able to effectively oversee efforts in these issues.

A Rivian spokesperson said the company was not commenting further during the quiet period ahead of its IPO.
SOC, formerly known as CtW Investment Group, is an advisor for union pension funds that have more than $250 billion in assets. It has taken a more activist approach with such companies as Doordash, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), around issues including board diversity, executive pay and company stock structure. This is the first time SOC has approached an automaker about the battery supply chain.

BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Rick Rieder and Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE’s Mohamed El-Erian are among those warning that systemic risks will only multiply, unless monetary officials take more decisive measures to pare extraordinary pandemic stimulus. While policy makers are acutely aware of the dangers in the easy-money era, their accommodative stances are encouraging ever-increasing flows to the riskiest markets.
The crypto industry just hit over $3 trillion in value, the biggest junk bond exchange-traded fund is booming after getting the most cash since March, and major stock indexes are sitting near records. No wonder a cross-asset gauge shows the easy U.S. investing climate is one for the history books. 
The risk binge is intensifying worries over market froth and lax central bank watchdogs. The world’s biggest, the Federal Reserve, signaled last week a delay in interest-rate increases until the labor market is in better shape after it announced a widely expected reduction in asset purchases.
“The risk is you’re creating overheating prices,” Rieder, BlackRock’s CIO of global fixed income, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “The risk to the system is you get too much liquidity in the system creating excess.” 
Last week the Bank of England shocked markets with a decision not to raise rates. Meanwhile European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back against wagers on a rate hike in 2022.

With supply-side pressures threatening growth, central bankers risk either acting too fast and derailing recoveries or being too slow and letting inflation get out of control. Officials are therefore taking a measured approach, despite some investors pressing for a more decisive end to pandemic stimulus. 
“It’s not clear to me why we need to continue to run monetary policy so hot,” El-Erian, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, said on Bloomberg TV on Friday. “The economy is doing just fine. But the collateral damage it’s creating, the unintended consequences that are resulting, are spreading. This is a Fed that’s going to wait and I fear is going to fall behind and we risk a pretty big policy mistake.”
Catherine Mann, one of the Bank of England policy makers who voted to keep rates on hold, sounded a cautious note in minutes of the meeting. The ex-Citigroup Inc. economist was seen urging an early end to asset purchases, saying it was fueling an “elevated level of risky asset prices.”
Investors may be doubling down on risk, but at least they’re building a protective cushion. 
According to the latest Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). monthly fund manager survey, cash allocations rose to a net 27% overweight, the highest since July 2020, while institutional traders are hedging in the stock-derivatives market. And with corporate earnings beating expectations, there are good reasons for credit and equity rallies in America and Europe.
At the same time while policy makers have been slow to turn off the liquidity hose, they’re at least making a start, said Rieder.
“Could they do it a bit faster? Yeah I think so,” he said. “But at least the door is open and we’re moving in the right direction.”
Kristina Hooper is among those downplaying a market rout scenario from any moderation in growth and tighter monetary policy, though she sees a cap in the rally for risky stocks like cyclicals and small caps.“We are in a transition to a more normal economy,” Hooper told Bloomberg Radio. “That, to me, is the theme for 2022. And that suggests that we’re going to see growth moderate, and defensive and large-caps perform better.”

OLIVER BLUME, 53
- CEO of Porsche AG since 2015
- Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) board member since April 2018

The bank had announced its plan to exit consumer businesses in 13 markets in Asia and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), where it does not have the scale necessary to compete, in April.
The move is part of Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to streamline operations and boost the bank's profitability. 
The exit will help release roughly $7 billion of allocated tangible common equity over time and boost its capital, the bank had said last month.
""In terms of Korea...the economics of winding down the consumer business are much more attractive than continuing to run the business,"" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said in a statement.
He said the exit from South Korea would help the bank release roughly $2 billion of allocated tangible common equity and in the remaining markets, it was in talks with potential buyers.
Citigroup will continue to maintain its institutional presence in Asia and EMEA through four wealth centers - Singapore, Hong Kong, the UAE and London.
The charges related to the closure will be incurred through the rest of 2021 and 2022, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

As part of its push to trim its operations, the bank had in August announced an agreement to sell its Australian consumer unit to National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) for nearly $882.24 million.
Besides Australia and South Korea, Citi is also closing its retail operations in Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

""The bank's decision was made in spring 2021 because Mr Weiwei did not provide legally required information despite repeated requests from the bank,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. 
""The termination of the client relationship was justified by business reasons,"" it added, confirming comments made in an earlier report in Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
The newspaper wrote on Saturday that  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) had changed its position from earlier comments to Ai that it had decided to close the artist's bank account because he had been convicted of crimes.
No rule exists that people with criminal convictions can have their bank accounts closed, the newspaper said, while Ai has never been convicted or charged.
In February, Ai answered detailed questions about his income, domicile and expenses from Credit Suisse, the Tages-Anzeiger added.
""So why was Credit Suisse using my 'crime' as its reason to terminate my bank account? Not long ago the institution announced that it was accelerating its recruitment of employees in China,"" Ai wrote in September on website artnet.com 
""At the same time, it would be seeking to take majority control of its joint ventures in the securities market and to apply for a license that would allow it to expand its business in both personal and investment banking.""
Ai, who spent 81 days in detention in China in 2011, later told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-activist-ai-weiwei-says-credit-suisse-closing-his-foundations-bank-2021-09-07: ""Even if they do reverse this decision, I am not willing to be associated with a bank which has such a strange relationship with China.""

The 64-year-old is one of China's highest-profile artists and political activists, and helped design the 2008 Beijing Olympics Bird's Nest stadium before falling out with the Chinese authorities. He now lives in Portugal. 
He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Saturday.

Investing.com – Shares of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and other U.S.-based carriers traded higher in Monday’s premarket as the transatlantic route opened to flights into the U.S. after more than a year of being shut due to the pandemic.
United traded 2.3% higher while American and Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) were up just short of 2% each. JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU), a recent entrant to the world’s busiest route, was up just over 1%.
All major airlines have committed to adding more planes and capacity to meet the demand as the holiday season nears. Reaching pre-pandemic levels on those routes will take time, though: fourth-quarter capacity is seen down around 23% compared to the same period in 2019, United said last month.
The traffic is expected to only pick up slowly as doors are effectively open only for the fully vaccinated.
Airlines were one of the sectors worst hit by the pandemic as travel restrictions and testing requirements - which were frequently implemented in patchy and ad-hoc ways by various countries - kept passengers away. 
The emergence of the Delta variant in the third quarter also temporarily slowed an incipient recovery in domestic travel. "

Members of the Unite trade union are stepping up strike action at two Weetabix factories in Kettering and Corby, central England, in a dispute over pay and conditions.
Around 80 engineers at the factories have been on strike every Tuesday and Wednesday since September. From Nov. 8 strikes will take place every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, causing further disruption to Weetabix's operations.
""We are working hard to minimise disruptions to our operations. We have a naturally resilient supply chain and have robust planning in place to help mitigate any shortages as a result of the strikes,"" a spokesperson for Weetabix Food Company, which is owned by U.S. cereal giant  Post Holdings  (NYSE:POST) Inc, said.
Britain's supply chains are being strained by a post-Brexit shortage of truck drivers and the global supply hiccups caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is fuelling inflation.
In August, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) pulled milkshakes and bottled drinks from its menu, and fellow fast food chain Nando's shut around 50 sites due to staffing shortages in its chicken supply chain.
Last week Walkers, Britain's biggest crisps producer, warned consumers faced short supplies until towards the end of November following an IT systems upgrade.
Unite said its members are striking at Weetabix over cuts to their pay, terms and conditions that it says will cost some workers more than 5,000 pounds ($6,744) a year. 
It said the changes amount to firing the workers and rehiring them under different terms.
The company disputes that.
“The current discussions with our team focus on a request for compensation for a change in shift patterns,"" Stuart Branch, group people and IT director at Weetabix Food Company, said. 
""As these changes are permitted under their existing contracts we will not be paying for them as it would be unfair to our other employees.""

The firm employs 1,000 people in Britain.

LONDON (Reuters) - The reopening of the United States to British travellers will help all airlines operating between the two countries, but for UK-based trans-Atlantic-focused Virgin Atlantic, it means ""the world"", its chief executive said.
""Virgin would not be Virgin without the Atlantic,"" CEO Shai Weiss said in an interview. ""This is the market that is at the heart of everything that we do.""
Virgin Atlantic, founded by billionaire Richard Branson, is 51% owned by Branson's Virgin Group with the balance held by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). 
In 2020, it came close to collapse as COVID-19 travel bans hammered business. Pre-pandemic it had depended on trans-Atlantic travel for as much as 70% of its revenues.
The last of those bans ends on Monday when the United States reopens for fully vaccinated UK travellers. Since August, Virgin has also benefited from the UK opening to vaccinated U.S. citizens.
Weiss said that he was very pleased with ticket sales to the United States, adding that there was strong demand for the Thanksgiving holidays and the lead-up to Christmas. 
Asked about the next three to six months, he said there was ""positive momentum"". 
British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) said on Friday it was ""very optimistic"" about the reopening of trans-Atlantic travel.
Virgin survived the pandemic thanks to a 1.5 billion pound rescue deal between Sept. 2020 and March 2021 and axing around half its staff to cut costs. 
Asked if there were any current funding worries for Virgin, Weiss said: ""No."" 

""Now that things are opening up we're in a better position. I think we're going to further strengthen our balance sheet,"" he said, without giving details of what Virgin was planning. 
Reports have said the airline is considering floating next year, but Weiss declined to comment on ""market speculation"".

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",Lagging business travel takes shine off transatlantic restart,"By Sarah Young and Rajesh Kumar Singh
LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Planes poured across the North Atlantic towards the United States on Monday, a boon for airlines after 19 months of travel restrictions - but that alone won't be enough for carriers whose profits depend on filling the most expensive seats.
Experts say the real battle of the transatlantic, the world's most lucrative travel market, takes place at the front of the plane, in first, business, and premium economy class, where those paying the top prices help drive airline profits. 
Question marks remain over the pace and extent of the return of corporate travel budgets, after the pandemic showed online calls and virtual meetings offered a workable alternative.
That's mixed news for the likes of British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) and Germany's Lufthansa, whose profits have in the past been buoyed by corporates spending more by booking closer to departure and flying at more convenient times. 
Shares in IAG fell 2.6% on Monday after shrugging off warnings of a big 2021 loss to close higher on overall transatlantic travel hopes on Friday..
Some business travellers are desperate to get back over the pond. 
""We are in a relationship business and travelling is necessary to meet clients, to win deals,"" said Anthony Diamandakis, Citi's co-global head of Global Asset Managers.
For smaller, non-financial businesses too, travel is essential for trade. 
""In my experience of the USA, it's a people market - deals get done face to face, with a handshake and looking into each other's eyes,"" Tony Kinsella, chief executive of UK-based materials development and testing company Lucideon, said.
The United States is allowing fully-vaccinated Britons and Europeans to enter from Monday, fully re-opening to two-way traffic for the first time since the pandemic started. 
""USA, here we come,"" said Kinsella, who already has his tickets booked. 
LONG SLOG 
Most experts believe that corporate travel will lag the recovery in leisure travel. 
U.S. spending on corporate travel is expected to reach only 25%–35% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021, and 65%–80% a year later, according to a Deloitte survey of 150 travel managers.
One British FTSE 100-listed company, which did not want to be named, said it planned to reduce travel for internal meetings next year by two-thirds on 2019 levels, and by one-third for external meetings. 
That means the full transatlantic restart might not be as lucrative as airlines would hope. 
Europe-based carriers tend to be more reliant on transatlantic revenues than their U.S. competitors. 
Pre-pandemic, those routes accounted for more than 26% of IAG's revenues and over 24% of Lufthansa's, according to Bernstein analyst estimates.
That compares with between 11% and 17% of passenger revenues at U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and 16% of Air France-KLM's. 
UK-based Virgin Atlantic is even more exposed, with an estimated 60-70% of its revenues coming from transatlantic routes.
Airlines do not break down transatlantic profitability, but one analyst estimates that at IAG for instance, first class, business class and premium economy flying account for more than half of the profits it makes from transatlantic flying. 
John Grant of global travel data specialist OAG does not expect transatlantic business travel to start to show any significant recovery until the second quarter of 2022. 
""Major conferences in the first quarter of next year have already in many cases been cancelled since the planning cycle is so long,"" he said. 
""Companies want to be sure that there is revenue to be had from such trips, so they will be waiting to see how economies and trade recover."" 
LEISURE UPGRADE
Airlines are going to be looking to leisure travellers to fill the gap left by corporates, and after months of lockdowns their pockets will be deeper, encouraging them to splash out on that premium economy or business class seat.
According to Willie Walsh, IAG's former chief executive who now heads up global airlines body IATA, the importance of corporate travel to airlines is often overstated. 
""Everybody assumes that people travelling in the premium cabins are travelling for business. They're not,"" he told a recent industry event. 
Airlines are trying harder than usual to entice leisure customers to upgrade given the dearth of business travellers. 
""We're seeing when people do take that trip, they're thinking more of the experience,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO Shai Weiss. 
IAG, Lufthansa and Virgin have spoken of strong demand for premium travel, and said that there are also signs that business travel is returning. 
Delta also said last month that its corporate bookings for Europe doubled to 30% of 2019 levels following the reopening announcement.

OAG's Grant said pent-up demand and seasonal holidays had helped lift fares on transatlantic routes in recent weeks, and the market would likely remain strong until mid-January. 
""The absence of business travel will make the airlines wary of adding capacity back too quickly in the first three months of next year,"" he said.

Investing.com – Coty stock (NYSE:COTY) climbed more than 8% in Monday’s premarket trading on stronger guidance, better-than-expected earnings and a balance sheet rejig. 
Under a deal with KKR, Coty will sell around 4.7% in hair-care maker Wella to the PE giant, cutting its stake to 25.9%. In return, KKR will redeem a little over half of its remaining convertible preferred shares in Coty, reducing the company's share count. That deal will generate annual savings of around $65 million, Coty said.  
The maker of CoverGirl cosmetics also rode a strong line-up of launches in the first quarter to drive sales higher as more people rediscovered their grooming habits after the pandemic. Gucci, Burberry, Hugo Boss, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, and Chloe grew strongly.  
Prestige cosmetics sales more than doubled year-on-year, led by Gucci makeup and the relaunch of Kylie Cosmetics. U.S. and China grew strongly, the company said. Travel retail was robust in Asia and Europe.
Margins were higher, driven by pricing and mix benefits, and higher production volumes.
First-quarter net revenue thus grew 22% to $1.37 billion. Adjusted profit per share of cents 8 was four times the expected EPS.
The company revised its annual sales growth outlook to around 15% from around 13% earlier.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cadillac brand is gearing up to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and other rivals in the luxury electric vehicle market with a new electric utility vehicle and nearly 40% fewer U.S. dealers than it had in 2018, the brand's global chief told Reuters. 
Cadillac has largely completed a restructuring of its U.S. dealer network and expects to have 560 dealers by the end of this year, compared with about 920 three years ago, said Rory Harvey, head of the global Cadillac brand. 
GM has booked a total of $274 million in costs during 2020 and 2021 related to the effort to buy out Cadillac dealers who were not prepared to invest $200,000 to $500,000 per store in the equipment and training to support the brand's shift to an all-electric vehicle lineup, planned by 2030.
Cadillac will still have more U.S. dealers than other established luxury brands, and has opened new show-rooms in New York City, Beverly Hills, San Francisco and Atlanta. 
The marque's largest market is China, and there it has not had to restructure retail operations, Harvey said. Cadillac's sales in China were up 20% for the first nine months of the year to nearly 181,000 vehicles. In the United States, Cadillac has sold nearly 96,000 vehicles for the year through Sept. 30, up 11%.
Electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc has no franchised dealers and sells cars directly to customers. Other EV startups such as Lucid and Rivian are selling vehicles online. 
Cadillac has a virtual showroom called Cadillac Live, and Harvey said inquiries through the online showroom are rising. But Cadillac will continue to sell and service vehicles through dealers. 

Next summer, Cadillac plans to launch the first of a wave of electric vehicles, starting with a compact utility vehicle called the Lyriq. Harvey said Cadillac has received expressions of interest in the Lyriq from 216,000 people.
""It far exceeded our expectations,"" he said. How many of those ""handraisers"" will turn into buyers will be key for Cadillac. Harvey said about 10% to 15% of people who show interest in an internal combustion vehicle ultimately buy one.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening just higher Monday, adding to Friday’s record highs in the wake of the strong October jobs report and the passage of the much-debated infrastructure bill.
At 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 75 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were largely flat.
The three major indices each closed at record highs Friday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 200 points, or 0.6%, the broad-based S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.2%.
These gains followed the official employment report showing nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs last month, more than the 450,000 expected and above the revised 312,000 in September, indicating that the country’s economic recovery was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, the U.S. House of Representatives late Friday passed the long-delayed $1 trillion infrastructure bill, likely creating a number of jobs modernizing roads and bridges and modernizing the transportation system.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT). His comments will be studied carefully given the U.S. central bank's move to start tapering bond purchases last week, and ahead of the latest CPI numbers which are expected to hit fresh multi-year highs. The CPI rose 5.4% on the year in October, equalling a 30-year high. 
In the corporate sector, Coty (NYSE:COTY) leads off a much quieter early earnings roster, while PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) report after the closing bell.
Elsewhere,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT),  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) and United States Steel (NYSE:X) are among the companies likely to get an earnings boost from the passage of the infrastructure package.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock slumped as investors prepared for CEO Elon Musk's proposed sale of 10% of his stake in the electric car maker in the wake of his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll.
Crude prices rose Monday after  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) late Friday raised the official selling price for its crude, indicating that it continues to see strong demand despite elevated price levels.
Attention this week turns back to the U.S., and in particular the release of the monthly survey by the Energy Information Administration, as well as ongoing chatter about potential sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
By 8:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $82.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.2% to $83.73.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,817.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1576.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",High prices spell no demand problem for resurgent Uber and Lyft,"By Tina Bellon and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Uber and  Lyft  are emerging from the pandemic as leaner, lower-cost companies with a long-elusive operating profit and the unexpected power to raise prices without alienating riders.
Ride-hail fares have surged to unprecedented levels this year due to a driver shortage. Much to the companies' delight, riders so far appear undeterred, flocking back to the platforms in ever-greater numbers.
""I think there is generally more pricing power than anyone ever realized existed in the industry,"" Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said on Tuesday.
On Thursday Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi called the current environment a ""giant pricing experiment.""
""Even with prices being up..., we're seeing that as cities reopen, people start using the product, and they use it a lot,"" Khosrowshahi said.
The shift marks a significant turning point for the former start-ups, which for years sacrificed profitability to add customers, undercutting each other with consumer discounts and driver bonuses. 
According to an analysis by YipitData, which tracks email receipts, average per-mile U.S. ride-hail charges in the third quarter were nearly 25% higher than in the comparable period in 2019. 
(GRAPHIC: U.S. consumers keep paying more for ride-hail trips - https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-LYFT/PRICING/mypmnknrnvr/index.html) 
For airport trips, which rank among Uber's and Lyft's most profitable routes, price increases were even steeper. The average fare for a trip to and from Chicago's O'Hare airport jumped nearly 50% in the third quarter compared to 2019, according to a Reuters analysis of city data. 
(GRAPHIC: Rise in ride-hail prices at Chicago's O'Hare airport - https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-LYFT/PRICING/zdvxonownpx/index.html) 
(GRAPHIC: Ride-hail trips at Chicago O'Hare still far down - https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-LYFT/PRICING/egpbkakwxvq/chart.png) 
Higher prices benefit the companies, which take a percentage cut from each ride. They also have resulted in record earnings for drivers, who also benefited from massive driver incentives paid by Uber and Lyft to lure them back, the companies said. Uber drivers and food couriers in the third quarter earned $8.6 billion, 60% more than the year prior, with driver pay growth outpacing that of gross bookings, Uber said Thursday.
While total driver supply remains below pre-pandemic levels, the companies said they were confident more drivers would return without additional incentives. They said they would taper off additional driver bonuses in the coming months. 
Lyft's Roberts said the company would fund driver incentives during particularly busy times through elevated consumer prices.
""We will likely see elevated prices for some time, particularly given the inflationary environment we are experiencing now,"" said Michael Erstad, an analyst at research firm M Science.
Uber's delivery business, which emerged as a backbone during the pandemic, also has avoided a post-pandemic let down.
Uber on Thursday reported stable delivery bookings, even as more people resumed going out. Its core restaurant delivery business Eats even reported its first operating profit, driven by better cost management and fewer consumer discounts, Uber said.
Higher prices combined with more efficient budgeting could boost margins in the coming year.
Both companies made drastic cuts during the pandemic to reduce their overall cost base. Those efficiencies, particularly in variable costs, will show as demand scales back up, the companies said.

But as inflationary concerns rise and ridership levels remain some 35% below pre-pandemic levels, Uber and Lyft need to strike a balance between price increases and consumer loyalty. 
""There will always be a ride at today's price point, which might be a faster pickup,"" Lyft President John Zimmer said in a Reuters interview. ""But it's really about finding the right ride for the right customer at the right time,"" he said, adding that consumers wanting a cheaper ride might have to wait longer.

NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - Retailers are launching holiday marketing campaigns to lure in-store shoppers as supply chain issues boost costs for consumers.
Big brands including Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and mall operator Tanger are spending more on marketing and using other tactics to spur holiday sales as they bet on shoppers venturing out after last year's COVID lockdowns. 
Even so, soaring costs to ship goods and hire workers mean customers will likely find leaner inventories and higher prices for products ranging from lipstick to stilettos and clothing, companies told investors on recent earnings calls. 
 Tanger Factory  (NYSE:SKT) Outlets is starting early marketing campaigns and Christmas tree lighting events sponsored by local businesses to lure people to its shopping centers. The company is also turning to on-site marketing including digital directories, retailer partnerships and back-lit signboards to keep people enticed while shopping. 
Etsy is pushing out gift guides and creating localized online events for holiday shoppers this year, Chief Executive Joshua Silverman said on a Wednesday earnings call. The company plans to target new buyers in the fourth quarter with television and digital video ads and coupons. 
Supply chain delays have also forced retailers to tighten their inventories, with some forgoing major holiday marketing. E.l.f. Beauty in August nixed holiday programming plans ""to prioritize core assortment in the face of the industry-wide container imbalance,"" Chief Financial Officer Mandy Fields said. 
Ralph Lauren, which is increasing its marketing from the first half of the year, expects outerwear such as quilted jackets to sell well this holiday season after strong results in the third quarter, the company said on its investor call. 
 Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) and Steve Madden are stocking shelves with early holiday merchandise including top-selling fragrances and glitzy, party-ready shoes, respectively. 
Tracey Thomas Travis, Estee Lauder's CFO, said the company is ""in very good shape for the holiday"" after manufacturing its products and ordering gift sets early. 
With inventories tight, shoppers may see fewer discounts on shoes and clothing. Edward Rosenfeld, CEO of Steve Madden, said the shoe brand is releasing fewer promotions compared with pre-pandemic levels during the holiday season. Michael Kors parent company Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) plans to increase prices of its bags, CEO John Idol said on a Wednesday earnings call. 

""As it relates to holiday, we will not be in the inventory position that we would have wanted to be in,"" Idol said, adding that the company still anticipates being able to meet demand. 
British clothing retailer Next Plc warned that stock availability remained ""challenging,"" with delays in its international supply chain being compounded by labor shortages in the UK transport and warehouse networks.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Sydney Airport Holdings said on Monday it has agreed to accept a A$23.6 billion ($17.5 billion) takeover bid from an infrastructure investor group in one of Australia's biggest buyouts.
The company said in a statement https://assets.ctfassets.net/v228i5y5k0x4/4E8IujXbovh6jYvB3lFrpF/54f59055011803b98b85aaaf5150644e/SYD_enters_into_Scheme_Implementation_Deed.pdf it unanimously recommended the buyout offer from Sydney Aviation Alliance (SAA), comprised of Australian investors IFM Investors, QSuper, AustralianSuper and U.S.-based Global Infrastructure Partners. 
The deal to buy Australia's largest and only listed airport operator comes as the country this month eased its international border restrictions for the first since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.
A scheme implementation deed had been made on Monday and a scheme meeting would take place in January, the company said.
It follows a sweetened offer by SAA https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-airport-board-grant-due-diligence-after-improved-174-bln-offer-2021-09-12 of A$8.75 a share in September - 6% higher than its first approach at A$8.25 - which convinced the company's board to give the consortium access to due diligence. 
""The Sydney Airport Boards believe the outcome reflects appropriate long-term value for the airport, and unanimously recommend the proposal,"" Chairman David Gonski said.
The deal is conditional on an independent expert's report, approval from 75% of the airport operator's shareholders and a green light from competition regulators and the Foreign Investment Review Board, a process that could take months.
""We look forward to securityholders voting on the proposed deal,"" IFM Investors Chief Executive David Neal said in a statement on behalf of the consortium. 
""Our alliance represents many millions of Australians ... and we intend to work hard to bring more flights and passengers back to the airport as the aviation industry emerges from COVID-19.""
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is investigating the transaction's impact on competition, including the impact of the consortium's ownership of multiple airports in the country. It is due to release its findings on Dec. 16. 
IFM Investors owns large stakes in airports in other Australian state capitals, including Brisbane and Melbourne.
RBC Capital analysts said the ""unanimous"" recommendation of the board had ""capped"" the potential share price appreciation, which on Monday was 2.79% higher at $8.46.
""I think it's good deal for investors,"" said Jamie Hanna, deputy head of investments at VanEck, an investor in the airport. 
""It think shareholders will probably vote to accept it next year.""

The agreement imposes ""no shop, no talk"" obligations on Sydney Airport and gives SAA the opportunity to match any potential superior proposal, the company said. It includes a A$150 million break-fee payable if the deal is terminated by either party.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 06:44AM ET</span>","Some investors have not received Evergrande unit's bond interest due Nov 6, say sources","By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Some holders of offshore bonds issued by a unit of developer China Evergrande Group had not received interest payments due on Nov. 6 by Monday evening in Asia, two people familiar with the matter said.
Scenery Journey Ltd was due to make semi-annual coupon payments on Saturday worth a combined $82.49 million on its 13% November 2022 and 13.75% November 2023 U.S. dollar bonds.
Non-payment of interest by Nov. 6 would have kicked off a 30-day grace period for payment.
Twice in October, Evergrande narrowly averted catastrophic defaults on its $19 billion worth of bonds in international capital markets by paying coupons just before the expiration of their grace periods.
One such period expires on Wednesday, Nov. 10, for more than $148 million in coupon payments that had been due on Oct. 11. Evergrande is also due to make coupon payments totalling more than $255 million on its June 2023 and 2025 bonds on Dec. 28.
A spokesperson for Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources could not be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Reuters was unable to determine whether Evergrande has told bondholders what it planned to do regarding the coupon payment due on Saturday.
BONDS, SHARES FALL
Evergrande's shares edged lower on Monday, finishing the day down 0.9%. They have fallen nearly 85% this year. Duration Finance data showed the company's dollar bonds continuing to trade at discounts of about 75% from their face value on Monday.
Once China's top-selling developer, Evergrande has been reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, and its liquidity woes have reverberated across the country's $5 trillion property sector, prompting a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in the developers' shares and bonds in recent weeks.
Spreads on Chinese corporate high-yield dollar debt widened to record highs on Friday, and on Monday Shanghai Stock Exchange data showed developers' bonds once again dominating the list of the day's biggest losers. One yuan bond issued by an onshore unit of Shimao Group was suspended from trade after falling more than 34%.
Falls even extended to investment-grade names. Tradeweb data showed a 4.75% January 2030 bond issued by a unit of Sino-Ocean Group Holding fell nearly 15% on Monday to just above 75 cents. Sino-Ocean is rated ""BBB-"" by Fitch Ratings and has a ""Baa3"" rating from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service.
Nomura economists Ting Lu and Jing Wang said in a note that they expected ""much higher"" repayment pressures on developers in the coming quarters, almost doubling from $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $19.8 billion and $18.5 billion in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively. 
""With the worsening property sector, we might see a rebound of defaults onshore by developers, and bond prices in onshore and offshore markets may increasingly impact one another as investors are on alert,"" they said.

""We believe regulators are likely to step up efforts to avoid rising defaults in China's (offshore commercial dollar bond) market.""
Regulators in October told developers to proactively prepare for repayment of both principal and interest on their foreign bonds and to ""jointly maintain their own reputations and the overall order of the market.""

Investing.com –  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT),  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) and several others traded higher in Monday’s premarket, buoyed by the prospect of an earnings boost from the Biden administration’s $1-trillion infrastructure package .
Caterpillar stock, habitually seen as a proxy for heavy equipment spending by business, was up 4%, as was Nucor stock.
Shares of makers of building materials and those of construction companies also showed gains. Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) was up 3% and Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR) 4%.
U.S. Steel,  Steel Dynamics  (NASDAQ:STLD) and Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) each traded up a little less than 4%.
Shares of companies specializing in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles also benefited. ChargePoint stock (NYSE:CHPT) was up nearly 7% and Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) stock around 8%. The bill provides for around $7.5 billion in extra spending in this area.
The proposed spending is one of the most ambitious and substantial investment in roads, bridges, rail, communication including high-speed internet, electricity grids and water projects committed by any administration in several decades.
Friday’s approval by the Congress includes an additional $550 billion of investment in water projects, electricity grid and safety efforts. About $120 billion of the new spending would come in the form of competitive transportation grants, a report in The Wall Street Journal said.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse strikes deal to refer hedge fund clients to BNP Paribas,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse said on Monday it had struck a deal to refer hedge fund clients to rival BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) following the Swiss lender's decision to exit prime broking and some derivatives businesses in the wake of the Archegos scandal.
The news comes after Switzerland's second-biggest bank said last week it would all but stop funding hedge funds by shutting most of its prime brokerage business, a division blamed for racking up $5.5 billion in losses when investment fund Archegos Capital Investment defaulted in March.
The collapse of Archegos as its highly leveraged stock bets went sour triggered a damning independent report that slammed the bank's risk management and raised questions about its ability in the longer term to compete with rivals.
On Monday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it had enlisted BNP Paribas to help its prime services and derivatives clearing customers find new providers, a move industry watchers said might hobble the Swiss bank as its prime services unit has been a key generator of revenues.
""Credit Suisse will support affected customers as they select alternative Prime Services providers of their choice,"" the bank said.
""Should customers seek to benefit from the referral agreement between Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, there will be a streamlined process in place to facilitate them obtaining Prime Services from BNP Paribas, under its terms."" 
Credit Suisse last week said it was quitting prime services, a business which provides financing, custody, clearing and advisory services to hedge funds and institutional clients, as it moves to focus on less risky wealth management. 
For BNP, the agreement will build on its continued expansion in equities. 
Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, which invests in bank equity and debt, said BNP Paribas was gaining market share in this business via several bolt-on acquisitions.
""It's a business where scale matters,"" Legras said. ""Now in the euro zone it's BNP Paribas against the Americans really.""
Data from Coalition Greenwich showed prime broking has been a growth engine for revenues from banks' investment banking businesses in recent years.
Global revenues from banks' prime broking businesses hit $15 billion in 2020, up by half from a decade ago, the data showed.
In 2019, BNP took on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s prime brokerage and electronic trading units when the German lender announced its exit from equities trading. 
In March it said it was to take full control of equity brokerage unit Exane, stating it planned to be one of the top equity houses in Europe.
BNP said last month its revenue from equity and prime services was up 79% in the third quarter from a year earlier at 835 million euros ($965 million).
The bank's stock has gained 38% this year, while a European banking stock index is up 36%.
In contrast, Credit Suisse shares have fallen nearly 20% this year. Last week, the bank posted a 21% fall in third quarter profit and said it expected a loss in the final three months of 2021 as it writes off some 1.6 billion francs ($1.8 billion) of goodwill related to the investment bank.

During a torrid year, Credit Suisse has also been fined for arranging a fraudulent loan to Mozambique, tarnished by its involvement with defunct financier Greensill Capital, and rebuked by regulators for spying on its executives.

The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled in favour of Edward Rogers on Friday, handing him a big victory in a dispute that pitted him against his mother and sisters and had weighed on the stock.

Edward Rogers was removed as the chair of Rogers Communications in September after he lost out in a family feud that started when he tried to dislodge Chief Executive Officer Joe Natale, saying he doubted Natale's ability to lead the combined entity after the C$20-billion Shaw deal in March.
However, following Friday's ruling, as soon as Edward Rogers was reinstated as chairman of the board, he showed support for Natale in a surprise move.

Investing.com – Softbank stock (T:9984) closed 0.8% lower in Tokyo Monday as heavy erosion in the share prices of portfolio companies took a toll on its flagship Vision Fund’s second-quarter performance.
The unit’s loss in the September quarter widened to 825.1 billion yen ($7.3 billion) owing to pandemic-driven writedowns, chiefly on Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI). Overall, the Group’s net loss was 397.9 billion yen.
Founder Masayoshi Son’s strategy of taking portfolio companies public has had its ups and downs. For the last quarter, the volatility in markets, caused largely by a regulatory crackdown in China, has hurt the fund’s portfolio, which includes  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Didi (NYSE:DIDI) and Coupang (NYSE:CPNG), among others.
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) saw its valuation fall by nearly a third during Softbank's fiscal second quarter.
The negative mark-to-market for public companies held by Softbank's two Vision Funds came to $17.7 billion during the quarter. Coupang was responsible for $6.7 billion of it and Didi $6.1 billion, according to Bloomberg.
The fund did manage to cash out some of its stakes successfully, generating 455.9 billion yen of realized gains during the quarter. SoftBank sold $2.2 billion of DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) stock in August and raised about $1.69 billion from a sale of Coupang stock the next month, the agency said.

(Reuters) - German chemicals maker Covestro on Monday raised its 2021 profit forecast for the third time and was confident about prospects for next year, while adding it was not clear if a boost from higher prices would continue. 
The company, whose products are used to make car seats and phone cases, beat analysts' forecasts with an 89% jump in third-quarter core earnings as strong demand allowed it to hike prices to offset higher energy and raw material costs.
""Overall, we believe that we can conclude a very successful result next year"", Chief Financial Officer Thomas Toepfer told Reuters, while adding he couldn't say at this stage whether the lift from higher prices would persist in 2022.
Covestro said it now expected 2021 earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 3.0-3.2 billion euros ($3.5-3.7 billion) compared with 2.7-3.1 billion euros previously. 
""We have increased our earnings forecast once again, which shows that we are on the move with good dynamics and are very confident that we can take this dynamic into the fourth quarter"", Toepfer said. 
Covestro also raised its 2021 return on capital employed (ROCE) guidance to 19-21% from 16-20% previously, but cut its core volume growth estimate to 10-12% from 10-15%, citing limited product availability.
Toepfer said the shortage was caused by bottlenecks in purchasing raw materials and other inputs, leading to unplanned production outages - including one at the group's Brunsbuettel site in Germany.
But he added the company produces many inputs itself.
Third-quarter EBITDA surged to 862 million euros from 456 million a year earlier, beating analysts' average forecast of 854 million in a company-provided poll. 

At 0930 GMT, Covestro shares were down 0.2% at 54.40 euros, having earlier risen as much as 1.8%.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A group of climate activists convicted for a protest against Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) applied on Friday for a review by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in a step their lawyers said could set a precedent for such cases.
A Swiss appeals court last year reversed a ruling that had acquitted the 12 climate activists of trespassing at Credit Suisse on the grounds their actions were necessitated by the ""imminent danger"" of global warming. That decision was later upheld by Switzerland's top court. 
The case went to court after protesters refused to pay a fine for trespassing in a branch in November 2018, when they had pretended to be tennis superstar Roger Federer to highlight his sponsorship by the bank, which finances fossil fuel projects.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on an ongoing court case. A spokesman for Switzerland's second largest bank said its sponsorship partnership with Federer and a partnership with the Roger Federer Foundation were both still in place.
Federer has previously expressed gratitude to climate activists ""for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions"". A spokesperson for his Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Some of the 12 activists delivered the appeal, known as an 'application', at the Strasbourg court. Wearing sweat bands and sneakers they played a tennis match outside, using a banner reading '#RogerForClimate' as a make-shift net. 
""This case is one of the first and it could create a European precedent,"" Raphaël Mahaim, one of the lawyers for the activists, told Reuters from Strasbourg.
A spokesperson for the court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The activists' request coincides with a youth rally through Glasgow to demand that leaders at the U.N. COP26 climate conference https://www.reuters.com/business/cop safeguard their future.
A growing portion of climate justice cases are invoking human rights and that may increase after the U.N. rights council recognised access to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental right.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in online retail platform THG climbed 5.7% on Monday after chief executive Matt Moulding said he regretted floating the company, feeding speculation the embattled technology company could be delisted after a sharp slide in its stock price.
The Times quoted an interview with Moulding at The GQ Heroes Conference saying he wished he had floated the company in New York and that listing in London has ""just sucked from start to finish"".
""We do have other options,"" Moulding said, according to the newspaper.
He also compared short sellers to bank robbers, adding THG shares had suffered from a ""pretty aggressive short attack"".
THG shares, which listed in London last year, have fallen about 70% in two months. The Manchester-based company, previously known as The Hut Group, owns beauty retailer Lookfantastic and supplements firm Myprotein.
In the latest sign of investor discontent THG's second-largest shareholder BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) sold nearly half its stake in the company at a 10% discount last week.
The sale followed a rocky month for THG in which its share price sank 35% in a single day after a poorly received investor presentation that focused on its technology platform Ingenuity, which sells e-commerce software to other companies.
THG has announced changes to its board and published growth figures for its Ingenuity technology unit in an effort to reassure investors.

The link-up with Liquid Intelligent Technologies, formally Liquid Telecom, aims to increase digital connectivity in Africa and to support the region's growing digital ecosystem, the partners said. 
The investment in data centres underscores the rising demand for cloud services even in relatively undeveloped corners of the continent.
U.S. tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are already competing with Chinese telecom firm Huawei to set up massive data centres on the continent as demand for cloud connectivity soars as companies save huge costs by renting storage space than building their own servers. 
IFC's equity and debt investments in Liquid, which to date totals approximately $250 million, will support the company to grow its hyper-scale data centre capacity in Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa through its subsidiary, Africa Data Centres, the statement said. 
""As Africa's population grows and is increasingly urbanized, data consumption is expected to grow strongly and with this comes the need for secure local data hosting,"" they added. 
The investments will also support the continued roll out of Liquid's fibre broadband network, which today covers more than 100,000 kilometres of sub-Saharan Africa. 
According to the Broadband Commission on Sustainable Development, sub-Saharan Africa needs around $100 billion in investment to achieve affordable and high-quality broadband access by 2030. It would need at least 250,000 kilometres of new fibre lines to achieve this.

IFC's latest investment in Liquid follows its investment in the company in February 2021 through Liquid's bond placement on Euronext Dublin, Ireland's main stock exchange. The issuance raised $620 million.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded nearly 6% lower in Monday’s premarket as a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll favoring a stake sale by CEO Elon Musk created anxiety about his next move.
Musk had asked his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake. He framed the question as a response to recent proposals from Democratic lawmakers to tax unrealized stock gains, as a way to finance their spending bill which is currently held up in Congress due to a lack of support for other funding options.
Musk had said he “will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.” The poll garnered more than 3.5 million votes (out of Musk's total following of over 82 million), and almost 58% of respondents voted ‘yes’.
Musk had previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options over three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock would free up funds to pay those taxes. 
As of June 30, Musk's shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5 million shares and selling 10% would fetch him short of $21 billion based on Friday's close of $1,222.09. 
Including stock options, Musk owns a 23% stake in Tesla, the world's most valuable car company, according to Reuters.
Tesla shares have touched all-time highs and traded around those levels last few days, against the backdrop of solid sales and profit figures from the company and the prospect - so far unconfirmed - of bulk orders from car rental firms such as  Hertz Global  (OTC:HTZZ).

At 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%.
There are a number of central bankers due to speak this week, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of particular interest at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), given the U.S. central bank's move to start tapering bond purchases at its meeting last week.
The Fed stuck to the view that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" at last week’s meeting, and the market’s belief of this could be tested this week with October CPI numbers expected to hit fresh multi-year highs.
Back in Europe, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane started the ball rolling by stating, in an interview with a Spanish newspaper published Monday, that Eurozone inflation will ease next year, repeating the bank's well established message that high price growth is temporary. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has the chance for some damage limitation to the bank's communications strategy, after it backed off a widely-expected interest rate increase.
In the corporate sector, Covestro (DE:1COV) stock rose 2.5% after the German chemicals maker raised its full-year profit guidance for the third time this year, after reporting an 89% jump in third-quarter earnings.
On the flip side,  PostNL  (AS:PTNL) stock fell 3.5% after the Dutch postal group posted a drop in earnings in the third quarter, citing slower international volume growth and disruptions in the global supply chain. In France,  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) stock fell 4.0% and Engie (PA:ENGIE) stock rose 0.7% after the former agreed to buy Engie's services unit Equans for some $8.2 billion.
The travel sector is also in focus Monday, with Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock up 1.7%, SAS (ST:SAS) stock up 2.1% and Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock up 0.6%, as the U.S. lifts pandemic travel restrictions that have barred many international visitors since early last year. That comes after  Pfizer 's  (NYSE:PFE) trial results for its antiviral Covid pill gave travel stocks a fresh boost on Friday.
Crude prices rose Monday after  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) late Friday raised the official selling price for its crude, indicating that it continues to see strong demand despite elevated price levels.
By 4:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $82.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.9% to $83.51.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,815.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1572.

NAIROBI (Reuters) -Kenya's Equity Group Holdings said on Monday it had launched a 500 billion shilling ($4.48 billion) loan programme to help small and medium-sized businesses to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bank posted an 85% rise in nine-month pretax profit, sending its stock up more than 4% to 52.00 shillings per share at 0739 GMT.
In March, James Mwangi, its chief executive officer, said Equity would dedicate about 400 billion shillings over the next five years to the businesses.
He told an investor briefing on Monday, the ""post-COVID resilient plan"" had been increased to 500 billion shillings and aimed to reach 5 million businesses.
The lender's nine-month pretax profit rose 85% to 36.6 billion shillings, helped by higher interest income, falling provisions for bad loans and growth from subsidiaries, Mwangi said.
Pretax profit had fallen by a fifth in the first nine months of 2020, when the bank's provisions for bad loans surged.
Mwangi told the investor briefing the lender's net loans increased 23% to 559 billion shillings, and this was expected to grow by 20% to 25% for the full year. 
Loan loss provisions fell to 5.14 billion shillings from 14.76 billion shillings in the same period last year, he said.
In March 2020, Kenya's central bank allowed lenders to restructure loans for companies hit by the pandemic and gave them until March 2 this year to carry out the restructuring.
Mwangi said of the 171 billion shillings in loans restructured due to the pandemic, payments on 122 billion shillings resumed in the first nine months of this year, with payments on a further 39 billion shillings in loans to resume in the next 12 months.
In late October, President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted a night-time curfew that had been in place since March 2020, which was expected to rejuvenate economic activity. 
Equity also operates in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, and has a representative office in Ethiopia.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>",ETF's big splash in MSCI's new China index puts pressure on FTSE China A50,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Just two months after MSCI introduced its China mega-cap index, the first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the new index began trading in China on Monday, armed with $4 billion, matching the money tracking the long-established FTSE China A50.
The red-hot debut of the four ETFs - two in Shanghai and two in Shenzhen - came after the funds, based on the MSCI China A50 Connect Index, raised 26.7 billion yuan ($4.17 billion) in China.
That put the MSCI index, which was launched on Aug. 20, virtually at par with the roughly $4 billion in global ETF money currently tracking the rival FTSE China A50 Index, which was launched in 2003. 
Global index publishers are in a fierce battle to woo investors with innovative tools to bet on China's giant onshore ""A share"" market, and MSCI's big splash will put pressure on FTSE Russell to come up with something new.
Having seen investor interest in its flagship China A-share index fade in the past few years, FTSE Russell, part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG), said on Friday it had recently launched consultations with market participants regarding the use of its China A index offering, and was reviewing the results for possible changes. 
FTSE China A50 has a wide market impact but MSCI has the late-mover advantage, said Duan Shihua, head of Shanghai Changer Investment Management Consulting.
The winner of the duel must ""understand investors' need, attract big money followings, and have a liquid derivative market"" based on the index, he said. 
RECORD TURNOVER
The four new ETFs - managed by China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC), E Fund Management Co, China Southern Asset Management Co and China Universal Asset Management Co - attracted huge interest on their first day of trading.
Combined turnover of the four ETFs exceeded 10 billion yuan. ChinaAMC's product saw debut trading hit 3.6 billion yuan, a record for a Chinese ETF. 
The underlying MSCI China A 50 Connect Index selects 50 mega-cap stocks in the A-share market, and fund managers tracking the index say it adopts a more balanced approach in sector allocation than the FTSE A50.
""The index gives more weight to China's new economy stocks, such as new energy, tech and healthcare, while avoiding overweighting of financial or consumer staples,"" said Jialiang Li, fund manager at Southern Asset Management, which launched one of the MSCI A50 ETFs.
The MSCI index is likely to become an investment bellwether for foreign investors as it provides a better reflection of China's economy, Li said during a roadshow ahead of the ETF debut.

MSCI has also partnered with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd in launching futures products based on the MSCI China A50 Connect Index, challenging Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)'s SGX FTSE China A50 Index Futures.
FTSE Russell has said that an established ecosystem around the FTSE China A50, including a liquid derivative market, is a ""trump card"" for the index.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 02:50AM ET</span>",Potential A321neo freighter may not be part of AirAsia’s cargo plan - logistics exec,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - AirAsia Group Bhd's logistics arm Teleport is aiming to expand its fleet of cargo planes but that may not involve tapping into its parent's large order for Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A321neos, Teleport's chief executive said on Monday.
In an interview with Reuters, Pete Chareonwongsak backed away from comments he made last week that Teleport would look to convert a ""meaningful chunk"" of AirAsia's orders for 362 A321neo passenger planes to a potential newly built freighter model of the A321neo.
""All I was saying was, if (Teleport is) successful, we're talking about large orders in magnitude of freighters,"" Chareonwongsak said. ""Obviously, AirAsia gives us a huge advantage, but that doesn't automatically mean that we can or we're able to source freighters from AirAsia."" 
Teleport will look at freighters converted from passenger planes like a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 it inducted last week as well as newly built freighters to grow its fleet, he said. 
Airbus has not announced the development of a freighter model of the A321neo and it faces little or no pressure to win freighter sales to boost the model's production, industry sources said.

Chareonwongsak said Teleport had been involved in AirAsia and Airbus' discussions about the feasibility of a dedicated A321neo freighter model.
He said Teleport aims to scale up its freight business to a size that AirAsia would consider it for operating part of its fleet for freight. Teleport could also source freighters from other airlines or cargo operators, he added.

BAE, whose main customers are the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia, also said that so far it had been able to overcome supply chain pressures affecting many other manufacturers globally, helped by the long-lead items it uses in programmes. 
Defence has been largely unaffected by the pandemic, with governments sticking to military and security commitments, and BAE said that many countries where it operated planned to raise their defence budgets. 
A builder of combat ships, submarines and fighter jets, BAE said that it was well-positioned to benefit from growing defence spending particularly in Asia Pacific through its Australia business.
""The recent AUKUS announcement is strategically significant,"" BAE said in its statement on Monday, referring to a new defence pact singed between Australia, Britain and the United States in September.
The deal will help Australia acquire U.S. nuclear-powered submarines, seen as a boost for BAE, which already makes nuclear submarines for the UK. 
""This is a clear example of how nations are looking to co-ordinate capabilities in multi-domain operations to address the threat environment,"" BAE said. 

The company added that it had to date completed 308 million pounds ($415.4 million) of a 500 million pound share buyback programme announced earlier this year.

The company, which delivers parcels and letters across Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, reported normalised earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) of 23 million euros($26.57 million) in its third quarter, compared with 36 million euros a year earlier. 
Analysts had expected on average a normalised EBIT of 24 million euros. 
""In the third quarter of the year, the changes in VAT for small goods outside the EU and other regulation in China had a stronger temporary negative impact on international volumes than anticipated, and put pressure on the performance of both Parcels and Mail in the Netherlands,"" Chief Executive Herna Verhagen said in a statement.
Postal operators have experienced a surge in parcel volumes during the pandemic as coronavirus lockdowns pushed shoppers to order online.
PostNL's overall parcel volume growth of 1.6% was slower in the quarter due to reopening of non-essential stores and borders as well as some disruptions in global supply chains, the company said. 
Growth in e-commerce picked up later in the quarter and is expected to continue, the company said, ""with some uncertainty related to Covid-19 and the changes in VAT regulation."" 
Its smaller Dutch mail business missed analysts' revenue estimates of 358 million euros. 
PostNL confirmed its guidance for 280-310 million euros in normalised EBIT for 2021, which it had raised in August as it benefited from a sustained boom in e-commerce under extended coronavirus lockdowns.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse's Asia decision making to stay in the region after overhaul,"By Scott Murdoch and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s key decision making power for Asia Pacific will stay in the region despite the previously separate division being integrated into the bank's broader structure as part of its new strategy, its regional chief executive said.
The Swiss-based bank last week said Asia Pacific would no longer be a stand alone division and its wealth management and investment banking units would be absorbed into global divisions as part of a paring back of the bank.
The decision has stoked worries from local bankers who fear a loss of autonomy could contribute to the bank's already declining market share in key investment banking divisions in Asia, two sources said. 
""We have always worked together with our global colleagues, whether they are in Europe or the U.S., for example on deals that have required a global solution for clients, and the collaboration across APAC will also continue. Nothing will change on that front,"" Helman Sitohang, Credit Suisse's Asia Pacific chief executive told Reuters on Monday. 
Sources said Credit Suisse's standalone Asia private bank was a differentiator for both customers and bankers.
Under that structure, senior managers usually had leeway to take decisions such as balance sheet lending and staff promotions, unlike many private banks in the region that relied a lot on their headquarters for key approvals.
One source said that despite assurances by management, there were worries that risk taking would be curtailed and the speed of decision making might slow down.
""As a region, we continue to be empowered to make decisions such as those related to market presence, key clients and HR-related matters, and at the same time maintain our speed of decision-making and connectivity to the global infrastructure that certain deals require,"" Sitohang said.
For years, Credit Suisse has been one of the most active investment banks in developing markets such as Indonesia and Vietnam, as it won mandates from entrepreneurs and business families, often backed by financing.
Asia Pacific contributes about 20% of Credit Suisse's global revenue, according to its most recent financial results. Its investment banking market share in Asia Pacific, including Japan, has fallen so far in 2021, according to Refinitiv data.
The bank sits tenth on the announced mergers and acquisition league table with a market share of 3.1%, down from 4.9% for the full year in 2020.
In equity capital markets – a key driver of fee revenue in Asia – it has a 2% market share, down from 3.1%, the figures showed.
Sitohang said Credit Suisse's Asian investment banking performance had been ""difficult because of the various headwinds we have had as a firm globally"", pointing to scandals involving hedge fund Archegos and supply chain financier Greensill. 

But he was confident the business could rebound. 
""The intent is to come back strongly and regain our market position,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower, lacking real direction at the start of a new week which includes key U.S. inflation data, an abundance of central bank speakers and the first reading of U.K. third-quarter GDP.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
The European equity markets received a lacklustre handover from Asia Monday, after data released over the weekend showed China's exports delivered a record trade surplus in October, but disappointing import results added to evidence of a slowing in domestic demand.
There are a number of central bankers due to speak this week, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of particular interest at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), given the U.S. central bank's move to start tapering bond purchases at its meeting last week.
The Fed stuck to the view that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" at last week’s meeting, and the market’s belief of this could be tested this week with October CPI numbers expected to hit fresh multi-year highs.
Back in Europe, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane started the ball rolling by stating, in an interview with a Spanish newspaper published Monday, that Eurozone inflation will ease next year, repeating the bank's well established message that high price growth is temporary.
The first look at economic growth in the U.K. for the third quarter is due for release on Thursday. This is expected to show GDP growth slowing to 1.5% from the previous quarter, a week after the Bank of England surprised the markets by keeping interest rates on hold.
Earnings from the likes of Henkel (DE:HNKG) and Covestro (DE:1COV) have been published Monday, but a lot of today’s focus could be on the airlines and travel sector, with the U.S. set to lift pandemic travel restrictions that have barred many international visitors since early last year. That comes after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s trial results for its antiviral Covid pill gave travel stocks a fresh boost on Friday.
Crude prices rose Monday after  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) late Friday raised the official selling price for its crude, indicating that continues to see strong demand despite elevated price levels.
Attention this week turns back to the U.S., and in particular the release of the monthly survey by the Energy Information Administration which should provide a short-term outlook for the market. 
By 3:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $82.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $83.64.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,817.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1565.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk should sell about 10% of his Tesla stock, according to 57.9% of people who voted on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll asking users of the social media network whether he should offload the stake.
""I was prepared to accept either outcome,"" Musk said, after the voting ended. 
The world's richest person tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stock if users approved the proposal.
Musk has previously said he would have to exercise a large number of stock options in the next three months, which would create a big tax bill. Selling some of his stock could free up funds to pay the taxes. 
As of June 30, Musk's shareholding in Tesla came to about 170.5 million shares and selling 10% would amount to close to $21 billion based on Friday's closing, according to Reuters calculations. 
The poll garnered more than 3.5 million votes. 
""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" Musk said on Saturday, adding that he does not take cash salary or bonus ""from anywhere"", and only has stock.
U.S. Senate Democrats have unveiled a proposal to tax billionaires' stocks and other tradeable assets to help finance President Joe Biden's social spending agenda and fill a loophole that has allowed them to defer capital gains taxes indefinitely.
Musk has criticized the proposal saying, ""Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you.""
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, who floated the tax proposal, said on Saturday: ""Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll.""
""It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.""
Including stock options, Musk owns a 23% stake in Tesla, the world's most valuable car company whose market value recently exceeded $1 trillion. He also owns other valuable companies including SpaceX. 
His brother Kimbal Musk on Friday sold 88,500 Tesla shares, becoming the latest board member to offload a large number of Tesla stocks which hit record highs. 
A week ago, Musk said on Twitter that he would sell $6 billion in Tesla stock and donate it to the United Nations' World Food Program (WFP), provided the organization disclosed more information about how it spent its money. 
Tesla bull Gary Black, portfolio manager at The Future Fund, said that Musk's potential stock sale would lead to ""1-2 days of modest selling pressure,"" but said there would be solid institutional demand to snap up the shares at a discount. 
TAXES ON STOCK OPTION EXERCISE
Musk has said he does not want to borrow against stock to pay taxes because stock value could go down. 
He has an option to buy 22.86 million shares at $6.24 each, which expires on Aug. 13 next year, according to a Tesla filing. The option exercise could lead to gains of roughly $28 billion based on Tesla's Friday closing price of $1,222.09. 

In September, Musk said he is likely to pay taxes of over half the gains he would make from exercising options. Last year, he said he has been relocated from California to Texas which should lead to a cut to the total tax bill because Texas has no income tax, experts say. 
""(It) seems crazy to borrow that much to pay taxes, so I have to assume he'd need to liquidate a substantial amount of the shares purchased from the option exercise to pay taxes,"" said Bryan Springmeyer, an attorney at San Francisco-based law firm Springmeyer Law.

Ant, the financial affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, saw its $37 billion IPO derailed by regulators last year and has since been working to turn itself into a financial holding firm.
Local media on the weekend reported changes at Jiebei after Chinese regulators in April asked Ant to conduct a sweeping business overhaul, which includes folding its credit products Jiebei and Huabei, into a new consumer finance firm.
They also criticised Huabei and Jiebei for improper links between payment services and financial products, saying that these may have over promoted loan services to users.
The Shanghai Securities News reported on Sunday, citing borrowers, that the Jiebei platform had made changes to show which loans were being provided by Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance Co, and which were provided by banks. 
""Jiebei is gradually working on brand differentiation,"" an Ant Group spokesperson said, adding that consumer credit services provided independently by banks or other financial institutions will be presented on a ""credit loan"" page. 
Ant did not elaborate on how much of its business would be affected by the brand differentiation.
Ant has been ordered by regulators to complete the branding restructuring of Huabei and Jiebei within 6 months after its consumer finance firm starts to operate, local media the 21st Century Business Herald reported earlier. 
Ant's consumer finance unit won approval to begin operating in Chongqing city in June.

Huabei and Jiebei were used by around 500 million people in the 12 months to June 30, 2020, Ant said in its IPO prospectus.
In September, Ant's virtual credit card service Huabei begun to send its consumer credit data to a database run by China's central bank, a key move for both the company and regulators as Beijing tightens its grip over the financial technology sector.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>",Shinsei Bank poison pill defence wins backing of another proxy adviser,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Proxy advisory firm ISS followed rival Glass Lewis & Co in recommending shareholders of Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd vote for the lender's plan for a poison pill defence against an unsolicited $1.1 billion bid from SBI Holdings Inc.
In a report dated Nov. 7, ISS said the takeover defence was warranted partly because SBI has failed ""to present specific plans to be implemented once it controls Shinsei Bank, causing uncertainty for shareholders.""
ISS, formally Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, also pointed out that SBI's partial offer would leave shareholders unable to tender ""in a position of minority shareholders of a listed company, whose liquidity will be significantly low.""
Recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis typically impact how foreign investors vote. Such investors account for nearly 30% of Shinsei's registered shareholders.
Mid-sized bank Shinsei opposed SBI's approach last month, saying that the offer could hurt interests of minority shareholders and that the price was too low. SBI, which owns an online brokerage and a bank, holds around 20% of Shinsei and wants to raise that to up to 48%.
Shinsei Bank ""appears to try to leverage the pill as a tool of negotiation with SBI Holdings to extract better terms by attaching two reasonable conditions, from which shareholders should benefit,"" ISS said.
SBI declined to comment on the ISS report.
The online financial conglomerate, which has said it can overhaul the mid-sized lender, has promised to make every effort to repay the 350 billion yen ($3.09 billion) in public money Shinsei received during a banking crisis two decades ago.
ISS said SBI's business plan is not specific.
On Friday, Glass Lewis said SBI has provided ""no measurable alternative to the status quo"".
The focus is now on how the government, which owns about 20% of Shinsei, will vote on the poison pill at the shareholders meeting on Nov. 25, which needs a 50% majority to pass. Government sources said it hasn't decided yet.
The SBI-Shinsei battle comes at a time Japan is witnessing a rise in hostile takeovers. But investors are also watching to see if, under a new prime minister, it will roll back some pro-market policies. 

Shinsei's shares were down 2.4% in Monday afternoon trading, compared with a 0.25% decline in the benchmark Nikkei index.

TSMC is among several companies, including South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, that the U.S. government has asked to volunteer information so it can better understand the global chip shortage. It has set a Nov. 8 deadline for submission of the information.
But the U.S. request has triggered industry concerns on trade secrets. The South Korean firms - the world's two biggest makers of memory chips - plan to leave out detailed information when supplying Washington with data, two sources said last week.
TSMC, a major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, said it had responded to the U.S. request to help address the semiconductor shortage that has disrupted production for car makers and consumer electronics suppliers.
TSMC said it remained ""committed to protecting our customers' confidentiality as always, ensuring no customer-specific information is disclosed in the response"". 
It did not give any further detail.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in September said the request for information was aimed at boosting supply chain transparency. She warned if companies did not answer the call ""then we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give us data"". 

Tech powerhouse Taiwan has said it was doing all it could to resolve the chip shortage. TSMC has pledged to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand chip capacity.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 11:30PM ET</span>","Indonesia carbon capture storage deal could need $500 million, official says","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Deployment of carbon capture storage (CCS) in Indonesia by American energy giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) could cost about $500 million, a senior official at Indonesia's state oil firm Pertamina said on Monday. 
Pertamina and Exxonmobil signed a memorandum of understanding during the COP26 summit last week to look at ways of using CCS in Southeast Asia's largest country.
""Our provisional estimate for investment needs is around $500 million, excluding operating costs that will be incurred during CCS operations,"" Daniel Purba, Pertamina's senior vice president of corporate strategy, told CNBC Indonesia. 
CCS facilities are likely to be implemented in two Indonesia oil and gas fields, namely the Gundih field in Cepu and the Sukowati field in Bojonegoro, in Central and East Java respectively, Purba said.
A spokesperson for Exxonmobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Pertamina and Exxonmobil would need to build a 4 km (2.49 miles) gas pipeline from Gundih to a reservoir where they would inject the carbon, and another 30 km gas pipline from Sukowati, Purba added. 
CCS traps emissions and buries them underground but is not yet at the commercialisation stage. 

CCS advocates see the technology as essential to help meet net zero emissions and key to unlocking large-scale economic hydrogen production. Critics, however, say CCS will extend the life of dirty fossil fuels.
Indonesia, the world's eighth-biggest carbon emitter, has brought forward its goal for net zero emissions to 2060 or sooner.

China's largest hot pot chain said late on Friday it would shut down restaurants with relatively low customer traffic and unsatisfying results and would launch a new plan focused on improving its operations of existing stores. 
Its shares jumped more than 11% on Monday to hit their highest since Oct. 28.
Reuters reported last month that Haidilao planned to slow its growth after its expansion and softening consumer appetite in China left it with falling table turnover rates and profits.
Haidilao, which became so popular in recent years that it appeased customers in hours-long queues for its soups by providing free manicures, snacks and shoe shines, was initially undeterred by the pandemic. The company embarked on an expansion drive in early 2020 that doubled its outlets since then to almost 1,600 currently.

Citi analysts said they expected Haidilao to incur one-off provisions or write-downs for its store assets or leases in the second-half but that the closures would reduce its start-up losses and boost performance at nearby stores. 
""We expect this restructuring plan to boost its table turn of existing stores in (2022),"" they said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning after China released its latest trade data. Investors also continue to monitor the impact of inflation on both monetary policy and the pace of economic recovery.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.14% by 10:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.10%. Data released on Sunday showed that exports grew 27.1% year-on-year in October, while imports grew 20.6% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at $84.54 billion.
Further data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, are due on Wednesday.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee will start its meeting, its first in more than a year, on Monday. The meeting will run to Nov. 11.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.47%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.19% and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.12%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.22%.
U.S. Treasury 10-year yields fell below 1.5%, which contributed to a rally in Australian bonds.
Data from the latest U.S. job report, released on Friday, showed that non-farm payrolls increased by a better-than-expected 531,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, in October.
“The strong jobs report is a welcome sign that the COVID Delta wave-driven slowdown was indeed transitory. This bodes well for the expansion, which is set to continue in the coming months, driving earnings and economically sensitive sectors higher,” Janus Henderson Investors director of research Matt Peron told Bloomberg.
U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that the U.S. economy is recovering from the pandemic faster and stronger than expected. However, Fed Bank of Kansas City President Esther George warned that bottlenecks contributing to high inflation will persist well into 2022 amid broadening price pressures.
George’s comments indicated that the debate about inflation continues to cast a shadow over markets.
“Inflation is the major headwind right now. There is a disconnect at this point between some of the expectations that we have about inflation and what consumers are feeling on the ground,” Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) co-chief investment officer Dana D’Auria told Bloomberg.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 05:07AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse Chairman Horta-Osorio says big investors back overhaul,"ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse's big shareholders back the scandal-hit bank's new strategy, Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio told Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag, adding the group would also overhaul its pay system for executives to reduce risk.
""We are in close contact with our shareholders - in particular the six largest, who together own around 30% of the capital,"" Horta-Osorio told the paper in an article published on Sunday.
""We think we understand their priorities and that they entirely support our strategy.""
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced a restructuring on Thursday, saying it would rein in its investment bankers and put money into wealth management as it tries to curb a freewheeling culture that has cost it billions in a string of scandals.
Horta-Osorio, who joined from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank in April, said he was putting risk management and responsibility at the heart of operations at Switzerland's second-biggest lender.
Harris Associates, Credit Suisse's biggest shareholder with a 4.9% stake according to Refinitiv data, supported the strategy, in a separate interview also published on Sunday.
""What has now been announced should have happened in the past 10 years: lower the risks, strengthen controls and at the same time preserve the entrepreneurial spirit,"" David Herro, a partner at the American asset manager, told SonntagsZeitung.
""There has been a clear lack of risk controls over the past 10 years. However, risk management only works if a cultural change succeeds and you have the right people for it. The new chairman understands risk and banking, which wasn't the case with the former chairman.""
Herro said he thought Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein had the right skills to lead the bank's turnaround, ""especially when he is surrounded by the right people.""
The investor said he was not unduly concerned by market reaction to the new strategy, with Credit Suisse shares falling more than 5% on Thursday after the announcement, which analysts said was not sufficiently bold.
Herro said the focus should be on creating long-term value rather than short-term price moves. Currently Credit Suisse trades at around 50% of its book value, below rivals like UBS, but Herro said it could recover.
""If Credit Suisse succeeds in generating sustainable cash flow with asset management and investment banking, I see no reason why the bank should not be valued at one and a half or even two times its book value,"" he said. 
A ""lackadaisical"" attitude towards risk and ""a lack of accountability"" were to blame for the bank's $5.5 billion loss on investment fund Archegos, according to a review published in July. 
Changing the compensation system was one factor to ensure a cultural change, Herro told SonntagsZeitung, an issue also addressed by Horta-Osorio.
The bank is also adapting its compensation model to reduce risk, the chairman said in his interview which he gave jointly with CEO Gottstein, and would present details in the first half of 2022.

""We will link wages more closely to the risks taken and the economic gain,"" Horta-Osorio told NZZ am Sonntag. ""This means that if a business is capital-intensive and consequently generates profits, the managers are not rewarded with higher bonuses.""

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>",Musk asks Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of Tesla stock,"By Ann Maria Shibu and Hyunjoo Jin
(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Saturday asked his 62.5 million followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in a poll if he should sell 10% of his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock.
The world's richest person had previously said he could face a ""massive"" tax bill this year as he has to exercise a large number of stock options coming due next year.
""Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,"" Musk said https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088 on Twitter on Saturday.
""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he said, referring to a ""billionaires' tax"" proposed by Democrats. 
Musk has criticized the proposal, which would affect 700 billionaires and impose taxes for long-term capital gains on tradable assets, whether or not they have been sold. 
Musk said that he will abide by the results of the poll, whichever way it goes.
The poll received near 2 million responses in seven hours after he posted it, with 55% of respondents approving the proposal to sell the shares. The poll is scheduled to end around 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Sunday.
Musk's shareholding in Tesla comes to about 170.5 million shares as of June 30 and selling 10% of his stock would amount close to $21 billion based on Friday's closing, according to Reuters calculations. 
'STOCKS GO DOWN' 
Musk has an option to buy 22.86 million shares at $6.24 each, which expires on Aug. 13 next year, according to a Tesla filing. Tesla's closing price was $1,222.09 on Friday.
In September, Musk said he is likely to pay taxes of over half the gains he would make from exercising options. He also dismissed the possibility that he would take loans with his Tesla shares as collateral. ""Stocks don't always go up. They go down,"" he said at the code conference. 
Some Tesla board members, including his brother Kimbal Musk, offloaded large numbers of shares after Tesla stock hit a record high late October.
Musk recently said on Twitter he'd sell $6 billion in Tesla stock and donate it to the World Food Program (WFP), provided the organization disclosed more information about how it spent its money.
His tweet raised some eyebrows in the world of finance.
""We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,"" Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter.

""Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,"" Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted.
Musk got into trouble with a tweet about taking Tesla private in 2018.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2021 03:25PM ET</span>",Supply chain problems crimp profit at Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway; cash sets record,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Saturday that global supply chain disruptions kept a lid on its ability to generate profit, while rising equity prices caused it to sell some stocks and boost its cash hoard to a record.
Operating profit rose 18% but missed analyst forecasts, as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus caused goods shortages and crimped consumer spending, while damage from Hurricane Ida and European flooding boosted underwriting losses at the Geico car insurer and other insurance units.
Net income, meanwhile, fell 66%, reflecting lower gains from stock holdings such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Berkshire repurchased $7.6 billion of its own stock in the third quarter and $20.2 billion this year, as rising stock markets made buying whole companies increasingly expensive.
The buybacks, which appeared to continue in October, suggest that Buffett, a 91-year-old billionaire, sees greater value in his own Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose businesses include the BNSF railroad and namesake energy unit.
""One of the big parlor games is, what is Berkshire's next big acquisition,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst with a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire. ""I think we just saw it: it bought back $20 billion of its own stock.""
Berkshire has also been a net seller of stocks, and sold about $2 billion more stock than it bought in the quarter. It ended September with $149.2 billion of cash and equivalents.
""I sure hope there will be more buybacks, because there's not much evidence of capital being put to work,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire a ""buy.""
DISRUPTIONS
Third-quarter operating profit rose to $6.47 billion, or about $4,331 per Class A share, from $5.48 billion, or about $3,488 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average forecast $4,493 per share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
Net income fell to $10.3 billion, or $6,882 per Class A share, from $30.1 billion. Buffett believes the huge quarterly swings in net results are usually meaningless, and result from accounting rules he doesn't control.
Berkshire said supply chain disruptions have boosted prices for materials and freight, forcing businesses such as Clayton Homes mobile homes and Acme bricks to raise prices - and caused a shortage of truck drivers at McLane grocery distribution.
It said the disruptions also significantly reduced new vehicle sales at its auto dealer unit and boosted costs for its consumer products businesses, though profit is rising from Forest River RVs, Brooks running shoes and Duracell batteries.
In part because of Delta and the disruptions, some caused by labor shortages https://www.reuters.com/business/with-bond-buying-taper-bag-fed-turns-wary-eye-inflation-2021-11-03, U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2% annualized rate in the third quarter according to the government advance estimate, down from 6.7% in the second quarter.
""The supply chain creates choke points that inevitably will affect loads at Berkshire's railroad, and is creating shortages in its housing businesses,"" said Tom Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which has owned Berkshire stock since 1982.
CATASTROPHE LOSSES
Results reflected what analyst Shanahan called an ""extraordinarily high"" $2.2 billion of catastrophe losses, mainly from Ida and flooding, though other insurers also suffered large losses.
Geico alone lost $289 million pretax from underwriting, hurt by Ida and an increase in vehicle crashes.
In contrast, BNSF managed to boost profit 14% to $1.54 billion, as higher volumes in industrial goods and coal offset lower grain exports.
Buffett's failure to buy more stocks and companies has disappointed some investors and analysts.
It stems in part from how special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which take private companies public, are driving up prices of acquisition targets.
""It's a killer,"" Buffett said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-results-spacs-idCAKBN2CI3GB at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 1.

CFRA Research analyst Seifert said Berkshire won't be sidelined forever, and might in 2022 eye acquisitions in sectors it has long favored, including industrial and consumer staples.
""Given the number of high-profile misses, such as Precision Castparts and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), one can understand some of Berkshire's reticence,"" she said, referring to the aircraft parts maker and food company.

""The bank's decision was made in spring 2021 because Mr Weiwei did not provide legally required information despite repeated requests from the bank,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. 
""The termination of the client relationship was justified by business reasons,"" it added, confirming an earlier report in Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
Ai wrote in September on website artnet.com that the bank had told him it was shutting his account because he had a criminal record, though he said he had never been charged with a crime despite spending 81 days in detention in China in 2011.
""So why was Credit Suisse using my 'crime' as its reason to terminate my bank account? Not long ago the institution announced that it was accelerating its recruitment of employees in China,"" he wrote.
""At the same time, it would be seeking to take majority control of its joint ventures in the securities market and to apply for a license that would allow it to expand its business in both personal and investment banking.""

He later told Reuters: ""Even if they do reverse this decision, I am not willing to be associated with a bank which has such a strange relationship with China.""
Ai, 64, is one of China's most high profile artists and political activists, and helped design the 2008 Beijing Olympics' famed Bird's Nest stadium before falling out with the Chinese authorities. He now lives in Portugal. Reuters sought comment from him on Saturday.

The deal, announced on Thursday, extricates Roche from ownership ties to a major competitor with strategic vetoing power, though it has kept a passive role in the face of powerful Roche family shareholders.
Roche can afford the deal without cutting back on research and development spending, and acquisitions, Franz told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.
Bridge financing will be used initially to pay Novartis, and then Roche would refinance the debt through longer-term instruments such as bonds, he said.
""Our net debt is almost zero. It is very important that we can raise the substantial debt without compromising operational and strategic flexibility with regard to our core business,"" Franz said. 
""We can continue our focus on research and development, we can continue in-licensing and acquisitions as we have done in the past years. We are not losing any freedom as a result of this transaction. Quite the opposite.""
Franz said he saw the new situation, with the repurchased shares being eliminated, as helping Roche proceed without needing to get the approval of Novartis.
""A key reason for us is that decisions requiring a two-thirds majority at the Annual General Meeting can only be made with the approval of a major shareholder such as Novartis,"" he said. 
""Although there was no specific cause for concern, this new situation is now clearer.""
Still, this didn't mean that Roche would embark on a buying spree of large acquisitions, Franz added.

""We believe that smaller bolt-on acquisitions are the right thing for us to do to strengthen innovation within the company,"" Franz said. 
""Also, in the medium and longer term, the transaction with Novartis would indeed give us more freedom to issue equity. But our policy of being very cautious with major acquisitions is not changing.""

Smart Glove, which makes gloves used in the medical and food industries, became the fifth Malaysian firm in 15 months to be slapped with such a ban.
In an emailed statement, Smart Glove said it had contacted CBP to obtain more information about the ban and that it would look to resolve the action. 
""Smart Glove stands against forced labour and is committed to all of our workers' health, safety and well-being; and we remain dedicated to their welfare,"" it said.
Malaysian factories - which make everything from palm oil to medical gloves and iPhone components - have come under increasing scrutiny over allegations of abuse of foreign workers, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.

The airline has 119 A321neo narrowbody planes, used for domestic and regional international flights, on order that have yet to be delivered, according to Airbus' order book. It did not provide details of the new delivery dates in a statement issued on Friday.
Southeast Asian budget carriers that had ordered hundreds of planes before the pandemic have been hit hard by travel restrictions that left fleets largely grounded for months, though the situation is beginning to improve. Vietnam and Malaysia last month allowed domestic flights to resume.
Vietjet's move comes a month after Malaysian budget airline AirAsia Group Bhd also restructured its Airbus orders and revised delivery plans. 
Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said in the statement that the agreement with Vietjet was another example of how the planemaker had worked with customers to find solutions to adapt to the impact of the pandemic.

Vietjet also said it would take delivery of up to three leased A330 widebodies in November as part of the airline's fleet development plan.
Vietnam plans to restart international commercial flights with 15 countries from January next year, its aviation authority said on Friday, eyeing a full resumption by July.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) -Rogers Communications Inc on Friday reinstated ousted Chairman Edward Rogers (NYSE:ROG) after a court backed his petition to constitute a new board, drawing curtains on a rare public battle for the control of a Canadian company even as the family feud showed no signs of ending.
The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled in favour of Edward Rogers, handing a big victory to the late founder's son in a dispute that pitted him against his mother and sisters and had weighed on the stock.
The rare public fight in the Canadian corporate world was sparked over the question of who should lead the company, and some analysts have raised concerns the dispute could potentially impact Rogers' C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) bid for rival Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR).
But soon after the ruling, Edward Rogers said that he supported CEO Joe Natale, though the entire conflict was sparked after he tried and failed to remove Natale as chief executive, saying at the time he had lost confidence in Natale's ability to lead the combined entity after the Shaw deal.
""Much has been written about Rogers CEO Joe Natale and his future,"" Edward Rogers said in a statement after Friday's ruling. ""Mr. Natale remains CEO and a director of Rogers Communications and has the Board's support.""
He said the focus must now return to closing the Shaw deal, the company's biggest M&A.
In a short statement, Rogers Communications noted the court's decision and accepted Edward Rogers as the chair, and said Natale remained as CEO.
'BLACK EYE'
Even as the brawl at the corporate level cooled off, the family fight showed no signs of easing. In a statement, the family matriarch, Loretta Rogers, and her two daughters said the ruling ""represents a black eye for good governance and shareholder rights and sets a dangerous new precedent for Canada's capital markets by allowing the independent directors of a public company to be removed with the stroke of a pen.""
""The company now faces a very real prospect of management upheaval and a prolonged period of uncertainty, at perhaps the worst possible time,"" the statement added.
Edward Rogers' attempt at dislodging Natale as CEO in September put him at odds with his mother and two sisters https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/key-actors-rogers-communications-boardroom-battle-2021-11-01, who are Rogers directors. Edward Rogers - son of the late founder, Ted Rogers - lost out in the ensuing power struggle, and he was removed as the chair of Rogers Communications.
Lawyers for the company on Friday asked for a short stay in the decision to allow them to appeal, saying that if the order was effective immediately, Edward Rogers could quickly take major steps that would effectively end the chances of a legal challenge. 
But Fitzpatrick denied the request, saying she was satisfied by assurances by lawyers for Rogers that the new board would not take any steps to end the family's appeal.
""Accordingly the order will be effective today and there will be no stay in proceedings,"" the judge said.
The crucial question for the judge was whether Edward Rogers had the power to make board changes with just a written consent.
""I have concluded that the process by which Edward obtained the Consent Resolution was available him under the Articles and the Act,"" Fitzpatrick said in a written ruling. ""In accordance with the Articles and the Act, the Consent Resolution is deemed to be valid and enforceable,"" she added.
POWER STRUGGLE
Edward Rogers said the judgment confirmed that he had acted in accordance with the company's rule.
""Our family has disagreements like every other family. I am hopeful we will resolve those differences privately, as any family would,"" he added.
After he was removed as the chair of Rogers Communications, Edward Rogers constituted a new board that included himself as chairman, leveraging his power as chair of the family-owned Rogers Control Trust - which controls 97.5% of the company's voting shares - to do so. He then petitioned the Supreme Court of British Columbia to validate his slate of directors.
""No surprises here,"" said one top 20 shareholders, referring to Friday's ruling, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""And since Edward clearly has the right to vote, the control block and the case was merely about process. For shareholders, this is the best outcome because it allows for the shortest period of uncertainty,"" the shareholder added.
The boardroom battle and the family feud has weighed on the stock, with Rogers shares down 0.5% so far this year, compared with a 16.2% gain in rival BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc and a 14.8% rise in Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp in the same period.
On Monday, both sides presented their cases, with lawyers for Edward Rogers arguing that he had the authority to appoint a new board without an in-person shareholder meeting.

But Rogers Communications' lawyer David Conklin told the court the late founder foresaw a stalemate between the family trust and the board of directors, and specifically requested a public meeting to resolve it.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",Some investors look to diversify amid big tech rally,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising valuations and hefty year-to-date gains for big technology stocks are pushing some investors to diversify away from the sector that has led markets for years. 
Tech stocks have soared this year, and their big weighting in the S&P 500 has helped push the index to records with a 25.1% year-to-date gain in 2021. 
Some investors are worried the valuations may have ascended into nosebleed territory. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for instance, trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.6, compared to a valuation of 21.1 for the S&P 500. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is valued at 26.2 forward earnings, while the information technology sector, up nearly 28% this year, carries a forward P/E of 26.4.
While gains in big technology stocks have boosted the S&P for more than a decade now, their heavy weighting could sink the index if tech falls out of favor. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple and Amazon, Wall Street's three most valuable companies, account for close to 15% of the S&P 500's market capitalization, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
Fund managers in last month's BoFA Global Research Survey named “long tech” as the market’s most crowded trade and had collectively reduced their “overweight” positions in tech stocks to the lowest level since May. The market’s top four most crowded individual stocks are Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, according to a recent analysis by research firm Bernstein, incorporating factors such as institutional ownership and price momentum. 
Limiting exposure to tech stocks over the last decade has tended to hurt portfolio performance over the long run, making investors wary of cutting their holdings too drastically. Still, some are looking to broaden their portfolios to reduce their exposure to the sector’s biggest names. 
Garret Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, believes large technology company stocks may be vulnerable to investors seeking to lock in profits and move some funds to other sectors. Melton is buying shares in financial and energy companies, which he believes will benefit from rising inflation and a strong economic recovery. 
""We're in the camp that the growth rate in the economy is being under-appreciated this year and next year,"" Melson said.
Analysts at DataTrek Research believe sectors that can benefit from rising growth, including financials and energy companies, are likely to challenge big tech stocks into year-end. 
“Technology has been a winning group for many years, and we expect it will continue to be so in the future,” they wrote in a Friday report. “But as investors consider where to allocate capital today … we think it likely they will seek out sectors with more exposure to improving economic fundamentals.”
Strong U.S. employment numbers on Friday brightened the economic outlook, as did news of a promising experimental antiviral drug from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). Travel stocks benefited, with the S&P 1500 airlines index climbing 7% on the day. [.N]
Investors will gain insight into inflation when U.S. consumer price data is released next week.
Denny Fish, a portfolio manager and technology sector lead at Janus Henderson, said inflation concerns and high valuations in the technology sector have prompted him to look for smaller companies that will benefit from growth of giants with more crowded stock positions. 
Fish is bullish on shares of Australian software development company Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) Corp PLC, whose product management tools ""augment"" Microsoft's suite of applications, as well as Canadian e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc, which benefits from the growth of Amazon, he said. 
""What we're doing is finding emerging companies that have even better growth than the giant companies and rational valuations that will outperform over multi-year periods,"" Fish said. 
Plenty of investors remain bullish on big tech-focused stocks, citing their strong earnings and history of dynamic growth.
Saira Malik, chief investment officer for global equities at Nuveen, is looking for tech companies that may benefit from rising inflation and have lagged the broad market rally. 

She believes shares of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has trailed the market with an 8% gain this year, will be one such “catch up trade,"" powered by growth in e-commerce.
""This is a time to be more selective,"" Malik said.

In 2019, the U.S. electric carmaker acquired Canada-based Hibar, which manufactures pumps used in fast-speed battery assembly that Tesla is introducing for its new 4680 cells.
""I'm delighted to share that Tesla Canada is joining our already robust automotive and technology ecosystem by locating a manufacturing facility in the City of Markham,"" the city mayor Frank Scarpitti said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""The facility will be the first branded Tesla Canada manufacturing facility in Canada and will produce state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to be used at the Gigafactories located around the world in the production of batteries."" 
City official Bryan Frois told Reuters the Markham facility opened this summer, marking an expansion of another site in neighboring Richmond Hill. 
Tesla did not immediately comment on the mayor's tweet. Last year, Tesla senior vice president Andrew Baglino said at the Battery Day event that its ""vertical integration"" with Hibar and others would allow them to build batteries faster and scale up production of its 4680 battery cells. 
Baglino said last month that Tesla will start delivering its first vehicles with 4680 batteries early next year, but added that ""this is a new architecture and unknown unknowns may exist still.""

Tesla currently builds the 4680 cells at its pilot factory in California and plans to start their production at its upcoming factories in Texas and Berlin.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 07:40PM ET</span>",Boeing directors agree to $237.5 million settlement over 737 MAX safety oversight,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co current and former company directors have reached a $237.5 million proposed settlement with shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the board's safety oversight of the 737 MAX aircraft, documents released on Friday show.
Following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in the space of five months in 2018-19 that killed 346 people, Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s best selling plane was grounded for 20 months and returned to service after the company made significant software and training improvements.
The proposed agreement, which is being filed in Delaware Chancery Court late on Friday and was confirmed by Boeing, will require the election of an additional board director with aviation/aerospace, engineering, or product safety oversight expertise within one year.
New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado, the lead plaintiffs, said the settlement if approved will be the largest monetary recovery in a lawsuit filed in the Delaware Courts over allegations that directors failed to protect against the risk of harm.
Boeing’s board ""failed in their fiduciary responsibility to monitor safety and protect the company, its shareholders and its customers from unsafe business practices and admitted illegal conduct,"" DiNapoli said. ""It is our hope, moving forward, that the reforms agreed to in this settlement will help safeguard Boeing and the flying public against future tragedy and begin to restore the company’s reputation.""
The agreement calls for Boeing's board to always be required to have at least three directors with safety-related experience, according to the proposal, which must be approved by a judge to become final.
Under the settlement, Boeing would amend its bylaws to require the separation of the CEO and Board chair positions, create for at least five years an ombudsperson program to provide Boeing employees conducting airplane certification work for the Federal Aviation Administration with a way to raise work-related concerns.
The settlement would also require Boeing to provide annual public reports on safety related enhancements implemented by the planemaker since the MAX air disasters.
The financial penalty is to be paid by insurers to Boeing, the documents show, minus up to $29.7 million in legal fees and expenses to the shareholder attorneys.
Boeing's current and former directors do not admit wrongdoing and assert they were acting in the best interests of Boeing and its stockholders, according to the settlement. 
The Delaware court in September ruled Boeing stockholders could pursue some claims against the board, saying the first 737 MAX crash was a ""red flag"" about a safety system known as MCAS ""that the board should have heeded but instead ignored."" 
The crashes have cost Boeing some $20 billion. Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.
Boeing confirmed the settlement and said ""Boeing has taken significant actions to reinforce and strengthen our commitment to aviation safety"" since the crashes.

The settlement, it added ""builds on those actions with additional oversight and governance reforms that will further advance safety and quality in the work that we do.""
Boeing's board includes the recent additions of Retired Lieutenant General Stayce Harris, who has over 10,000 hours experience as a pilot of Boeing aircraft; and David Joyce, who led GE Aviation from 2009 to 2020.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes scored record closing highs on Friday and booked solid gains for the week following a strong U.S. jobs report and positive data for  Pfizer 's experimental pill against COVID-19.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched record high closes for their seventh straight sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed at a record. All three indexes posted weekly gains for their fifth straight weeks.
The Labor Department report showed U.S. employment increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided.
A trial of Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease. Pfizer shares jumped about 11%.
The news kept the run going for equities after investors earlier in the week digested the Federal Reserve's decision to start reducing its monthly bond purchases put in place to support the economy.
""Momentum that we have seen this week has continued, and the jobs report and the Pfizer announcement certainly are providing positive datapoints for investors to put more money into the market right now,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 203.72 points, or 0.56%, to 36,327.95, the S&P 500 gained 17.47 points, or 0.37%, to 4,697.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.28 points, or 0.2%, to 15,971.59.
For the week, the S&P 500 rose 2%, the Dow added 1.42%, while the Nasdaq gained 3.05%.
Travel stocks rose following Pfizer's announcement, with the S&P 1500 airlines index climbing 7%, and cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp,  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises and Norwegian Cruise rising between about 8% to 9%.
""Still early to be definitive but this (pill) looks like a true game changer for many industries like leisure and transportation, you're seeing it reflected in the prices,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
Among S&P 500 sectors, energy and industrials led the way, rising 1.4% and 1%, respectively.
Healthcare was the only sector that ended negative, falling 1%. The Pfizer news weighed on shares of competitors such as Merck, which fell nearly 10%, and COVID-19 vaccine makers such as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which slumped 16.6%.
Shares of so-called ""stay-at-home"" names fell, with  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) down 6.2% and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) off 3.4%.
Better-than-expected third-quarter earnings have helped lift sentiment for equities. With about 440 companies having reported, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 41.5% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc shares climbed 5.9% after the company's strong fourth-quarter revenue forecast.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc shares slumped 35.3% after the company slashed its full-year sales forecast by up to $1 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 83 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 303 new highs and 80 new lows.
About 11.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 06:36PM ET</span>","EV maker Rivian boosts IPO price range, aims for $65 billion valuation","(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive, backed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), on Friday significantly raised the expected offer price of its shares, with the electric vehicle manufacturer aiming for a valuation of as much as $65 billion in its initial public offering.
It had earlier this week aimed for a valuation of more than $53 billion at a price of $62 per share. The company now expects to sell 135 million shares in the range of $72-$74 apiece to raise nearly $10 billion on Nov. 9.
The increased price band follows a successful investor roadshow this week, as Wall Street's big IPO investors bet on Rivian to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The IPO could make Rivian one of the only three companies that have raised more than $8 billion in a decade after  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
While the startup has yet to sell any significant volume of its electric vans or trucks, a $65 billion valuation for Rivian could make it more valuable than Fiat maker Stellantis NV and bring it closer to legacy automakers Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM). 
Rivian has been investing heavily to ramp up production, including for its upscale all-electric R1T pickup truck which was launched in September, beating out competition from established rivals such as Tesla Inc, General Motors and Ford.
The company had about 55,400 R1T and R1S preorders in the United States and Canada, as of Oct. 31.
Rivian said it had started deliveries of the R1T and had recorded revenue for the three months ended September 30. Net loss for that period, however, is estimated to increase due to higher production costs.
The EV market is booming as consumers are more environment conscious and is seen as a symbol of luxury for many brands. Tesla produced a record number of cars in its latest quarter, suggesting strong demand for electric cars. 
Amazon has ordered 100,000 of Rivian's electric delivery vans as part of the e-commerce giant's broader effort to cut its carbon footprint. 
Rivian will, however, face competition from automakers in both the consumer and commercial van markets. 
Ford said it has more than 160,000 orders for its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck and that an electric version of its Transit commercial van is ""completely sold out."" 

General Motors is gearing up production of electric delivery vans, SUVs and pickup trucks.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters. Rivian will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""RIVN"". The valuation includes shares that underwriters could exercise under the ""greenshoe"" option.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -World equities markets reached new heights on Friday after a session-long climb, booking a week of solid gains following a strong U.S. jobs report.
The dollar index, which had hit a one-year peak earlier in the session, slightly retreated in late trading as risk appetite improved and stocks rallied.
The moves came after U.S. Labor Department jobs data rebounded in a reassuring sign for investors who had worried for months about how stocks would fare once the Federal Reserve began rolling back the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic-fueled stimulus.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs last month as the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, offering more evidence that U.S. economic activity was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
Global stocks have seen a series of records in recent weeks, bolstered by blockbuster earnings reports from the biggest U.S. listed companies. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rivals, rose as high as 94.634 after the jobs report, its highest level since Sept. 25, 2020. The currency's strengthening to its highest level in more than a year offers the Fed more evidence that the economic recovery has regained momentum.
""If these numbers continue at this pace, we could probably see full employment at the end of the first quarter,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Securities.
Crude prices rose more than 2% on Friday on renewed supply concerns after OPEC+ producers rebuffed a U.S. call to accelerate output increases even as demand nears pre-pandemic levels.
Brent crude was up $2.14, or 2.7%, at $82.68 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) gained $2.47, or 3% to $81.28.
""Markets know that the release of strategic reserves can only have a temporary bearish effect on prompt prices and is not a lasting solution for an imbalance between supply and demand,"" Rystad Energy head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen said in a note. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.56%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.37%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.05%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.17%.
Friday's advances came even after the Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would begin tapering its massive asset purchase program, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he was in no rush to hike borrowing costs.
""Even though it transpired as expected, it is a significant milestone. The direction of travel is now clearly towards policy normalization, though the Fed emphasized that tapering is not tightening,"" said Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist for LGT in Asia Pacific. ""It was really expert communication and very well handled.""
U.S. Treasury yields tumbled and the curve flattened in choppy trading on Friday amid uncertainty
The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell to its lowest level since Sept. 24 at 1.436% and marked its biggest downward move since July 19, was last 7.4 basis points lower at 1.4496%.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.29% lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.61%.
Hong Kong had weighed on the regional index, falling 1.25% as index heavyweight and rate-sensitive HSBC fell 3.6% following a dovish call from the Bank of England (BoE) and anxiety over property stocks.
Trading in shares of Chinese developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd was suspended a day after the company said a subsidiary had missed a payment on a wealth-management product, the latest sign of a deepening liquidity crisis in the Chinese property sector. 
An index tracking Hong Kong-listed mainland Chinese developers slipped 2.8%, and an onshore China property index lost 2%. 
More broadly, Shanghai shares lost 1% and Chinese blue chips slipped 0.5%.
While investors were happy with the Fed's communications, some felt that they had been misdirected by policymakers at the BoE. 
The Bank of England's decision on Thursday not to lift rock-bottom benchmark rates proved the biggest shock for markets and pushed sterling to its biggest one-day fall in more than 18 months by as much as 1.6% on the day.
Sterling fell as much as 0.5% on Friday, hitting a fresh one-month low of $1.34250. It was last down 0.07%. 

Germany's 10-year bond yield looked set for its biggest weekly drop since June last year, down 15 basis points as central banks left policy rates unchanged.

(Reuters) - SolarWinds Corp investors have sued the software company's directors, alleging they knew about and failed to monitor cybersecurity risks to the company ahead of a breach that created a vulnerability in thousands of its customers' systems.
The lawsuit filed in Delaware on Thursday appears to be the first based on records shareholders demanded from the company after Reuters reported last December that malicious code inserted into one of the company's software updates left U.S. government agencies and companies exposed.
The lawsuit names a mix of current and former directors as defendants.
A SolarWinds spokesperson said the company does not comment on pending litigation, but noted it is focused on ""deepening"" customer relationships and ""openly discussing our Secure by Design initiatives as we look to set the standard for secure software development.""
Led by a Missouri pension fund, the investors allege that the board failed to implement procedures to monitor cybersecurity risks, such as requiring the company's management to report on those risks regularly.
They are seeking damages on behalf of the company and to reform the company's policies on cybersecurity oversight.

The lawsuit is the latest fallout over the breach of SolarWinds' software, which gave hackers access to the data of thousands of companies and government offices that used its products and which U.S. officials have attributed to Russia.
SolarWinds has said it is cooperating with investigations into the breach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and others. The company has moved to dismiss another shareholder lawsuit seeking damages for a decline in its share price.

Now, Wall Street analysts’ price target for TSLA indicates a potential downside. Therefore, we think fundamentally sound EV stocks NIO (NIO), Li Auto (LI), and Workhorse (WKHS) could be better investment choices to cash in on the EV industry’s immense growth prospects. Let’s discuss.Due to climate concerns, governments worldwide are lending greater importance to emission control initiatives. Consequently, the electric vehicles (EVs) market is growing quickly. President Biden’s infrastructure bill proposal, which is expected to be passed imminently, has a $7.5 billion provision for EV charging networks. Furthermore, the EV-related proposals in the spending plan also include more than $100 billion in tax credits, which could slash EV prices and boost demand for them. The global EV market is expected to reach $917.70 billion in 2028, growing at a 20.6% CAGR.
EV giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) has attracted enviable investor attention of late, which has driven the stock to trade at an expensive valuation. Its 200.78 forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is currently 1,167.7% higher than the 15.84 industry average. And in terms of forward Price/Sales multiple, TSLA is trading 1,802.6% above the 1.27 industry average. In addition, for its third fiscal quarter, ended September 30, TSLA’s total cost of revenue increased 50.5% year-over-year to $10.1 billion, while its total operating expenses rose 32.1% from the same period last year to $1.66 billion. And its $835.53 12-month median price target indicates a 32.1% potential downside.
Therefore, we think EV stocks NIO Inc. (NIO), Li Auto Inc. (LI), and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) could be better bets than TSLA to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. These stocks possess solid upsides based on the Street's predictions.

Peloton did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
At least 15 analysts lowered their price target on the Peloton stock after the company cut its annual sales forecast by up to $1 billion and reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in more than a year.
Wedbush analyst James Hardiman, rated five star by Refinitiv, dubbed Peloton's ""fall from grace"" in such a short period of time as ""fairly astonishing"".
Peloton's near-term sales is clouded by slowing traffic online, a shift to the lower-priced Bike and slower adoption of Tread, Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group, another highly rated analyst, said in a note.
Telsey cut her rating to 'market perform' from 'outperform', but along with a few other brokerages, she remained positive about its long-term prospects.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said Peloton's connected fitness opportunity could still be intact, but the path to get there appears ""more difficult"".
However, with gyms back in favor, Gajrawala said Peloton needs to adopt a different strategy as gyms are planning to offer digital content.
To tackle falling sales, the New York-based company outlined plans to boost marketing spend. BMO's Simeon Siegel, however, doubted if that would be enough.
""There are plenty of new entrants fighting for mind and market share and that suggests that increasing marketing dollars will likely prove necessary, but hardly sufficient,"" Siegel said.

The trial's results suggest that  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s drug surpasses Merck & Co Inc's pill, molnupiravir, which was shown last month https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-covid-19-pill-cuts-risk-death-hospitalization-by-50-study-2021-10-01 to halve the chance of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients at high risk of serious illness.
Pfizer's pill, with the brand name Paxlovid, could secure U.S. regulatory approval by the end of the year. Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the Nov. 25 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. The trial was stopped early due to its high success rate. 
President Joe Biden said the U.S. government has secured millions of doses of Pfizer's drug. 
""If authorized by the FDA we may soon have pills that treat the virus in those who become infected,"" Biden said. ""The therapy would be another tool in our toolbox to protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID.""
Shares in Pfizer, which also makes one of the mostly widely used COVID-19 vaccines, rose 11% to close at $48.61. Merck's fell 10% to close at $81.61. Shares of vaccine makers took a hit, with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, Pfizer's German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) all down 11-21%.
Pfizer's pill is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir. The treatment consists of three pills given twice daily. It has been in development for nearly two years https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/inside-race-find-covid-19-treatment-pill-2021-05-21.
The Pfizer and Merck pills are eagerly anticipated, with only limited options currently available for treating people sick with COVID-19. Full trial data is not yet available from either company. 
Pfizer is in active discussions with 90 countries over supply contracts for its pill, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in an interview.
""Our goal is that everyone in the world would be able to have it as quickly as possible,"" Bourla said. Bourla added that for high-income countries Pfizer expects to price its treatment close to where Merck has priced its drug. Merck's U.S. contract price is around $700 for a five-day course of therapy. For low-income countries, Bourla said Pfizer is considering several options, with the goal of ""no barrier for them as well to have access.""
Merck's pill was approved by British regulators https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/britain-approves-mercks-oral-covid-19-pill-2021-11-04 in a world first on Thursday.
Even with the potential offered by the Pfizer and Merck pills, preventing COVID-19 infections through broad use of vaccines remains the best way to control a pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people worldwide, including more than 750,000 in the United States, infectious disease experts said.
""Vaccines are going to be the most effective and reliable tool that we have in this pandemic,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. ""These oral medications are going to augment our ability to really reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death, which is huge, but it won't prevent infection.""
While more than 7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, that has covered only about half the world's people. In the United States, 58% of all people, including 70% of adults, are fully vaccinated. 
Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan forecast a ""very minor impact"" from Pfizer's drug on vaccination among people who do not want the vaccine or a booster shot as recommended by U.S. health regulators. 
""I think there's a small percentage of people that may decide not to get vaccinated now that there are good treatment options,"" Divan said.
MANUFACTURING GOALS
Pfizer said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of this year and at least 50 million courses by the end of next year, including 21 million in the first half of 2022. Bourla said that, based on the better-than-expected trial results, Pfizer is considering potentially doubling next year's manufacturing target.
Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, to be most effective. 
The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer's study examined hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.
Among those given Pfizer's drug within three days of symptom onset, the pill lowered the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe COVID-19 by 89% compared to those receiving a placebo. Among these patients, 0.8% were hospitalized and none died by 28 days after treatment, compared to a 7% hospitalization rate and seven deaths in the placebo group.
Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms: 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared to 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths. Pfizer said that represents 85% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization or death. 

Two other trials - one in people without underlying risk factors and another in people who have been exposed to the virus but are not yet infected - are continuing, with those results likely be available in the first quarter of 2022, Bourla said. 
Pfizer did not detail side any effects but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients. Possible side effects include nausea and diarrhea.

The FDA has now authorized 11 batches of the vaccine manufactured at the facility.
In April, U.S. authorities halted production after ingredients from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine.

Today's authorization was based on a thorough review of facility records and quality testing by the manufacturer, and considering the current COVID-19 public health emergency, the health agency said in a statement.
An estimated 30 million to 50 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine made early this year have been sitting idle in the Baltimore plant for weeks awaiting a green light from U.S. regulators to ship, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters late last month.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 04:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive-US Foods seeks new top executives amid investor pressure -sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Corp is seeking to hire a chief operating officer and replace its chief financial officer as it faces pressure from an activist investment firm to improve its operations, according to people familiar with the matter.
US Foods, the largest U.S. food distributor after  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY), has been grappling with labor shortages and supply chain issues since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While demand has picked up in the last few months with customers returning to restaurants it supplies, US Foods' profitability has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels because it is forced to pay more to retain workers.
Sachem Head Capital Management LP, a New York-based firm run by hedge fund veteran Scott Ferguson, said in a regulatory filing last month that it owned 5.1% of US Foods' common stock and that it may seek to speak with the company's management and organize with other shareholders. 
It also said it was being advised by  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc Executive Chairman Bernardo Hees, who as a partner at private equity firm 3G Capital developed a reputation for implementing draconian cost cuts. He practiced such austerity as chief executive officer of fast-food restaurant chain Burger King Worldwide Holdings Inc and then as CEO of food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co.
The management shake-up under way at US Foods offers the clearest indication yet that the Rosemont, Illinois-based company is pursuing changes as it prepares to defend itself against a possible board challenge from Sachem Head. 
The company has not had a chief operating officer since 2015, when Stuart Schuette announced he would leave and then became chief executive of American Tire Distributors. It is now looking for a chief operating officer, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Dirk Locascio has been US Foods' CFO since 2017. The company has been searching for his replacement, the sources said.
Pietro Satriano became US Foods' CEO in 2015 after a federal judge blocked the company's sale to Sysco. It is not clear how long he will remain with the company, which does not have employment agreements with any of its executives, according to a regulatory filing. One of the sources said US Foods' board of directors has in recent months deliberated about Satriano's succession.
“The company does not comment on rumors,” a company spokesperson said.
US Foods was previously owned by buyout firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, which took it public in 2016. It now has a market value of $8.2 billion.
US Foods has been trying to address soaring price inflation and labor shortages that have led to inventory write-offs and higher distribution costs. 

It has sought to improve working conditions by capping the number of hours a new employee works and offering more bonuses, according to BTIG analysts. 
Still, its profitability stood at 15.3% in the three months to July 3, compared with 17.7% in the corresponding period two years ago, before the pandemic hit. The company will report quarterly earnings on Monday.

The deal could be announced on Monday, although the talks could still fall apart, the report said.
McAfee and Advent did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The potential deal comes at a time when the pandemic-driven shift to remote working and a rise in cyber attacks has spurred demand for antivirus and digital security software.
Seeking to create a leader in consumer security software, U.S.-based NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) Inc in August agreed to buy London-listed rival Avast Plc for up to $8.6 billion.

Shares of McAfee, which made its market debut last year, closed 20% higher on Friday at $25.46.
The company said in March it would sell its enterprise business to a consortium led by Symphony Technology Group for $4 billion in cash.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) will increase dividend payments to shareholders once it gets debt levels to $25 billion, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on Friday. 
""We are going to get there sooner than we expected,"" Hollub told analysts on a call to comment on the company's third-quarter results. 
Occidental quadrupled its debt in 2019 to $40 billion after buying https://www.reuters.com/article/us-anadarko-petrol-m-a-chevron/chevron-drops-anadarko-takeover-battle-after-occidental-raises-bid-idUSKCN1SF1GX rival oil producer Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) and its prized assets in the United States' huge Permian shale oilfield. 
It used cash from this year's higher commodity prices to repay $4.3 billion of long-term debt in the third quarter, bringing it down to $31 billion. Occidental aims to pare debt below the $25 billion target, she said. 
The company, which earlier this week declared a quarterly dividend of a penny per share on common stock, did not specify by how much its dividends would increase. 
Shares fell 1% to $33.44 in afternoon trading after Hollub ruled out resuming buybacks, saying repurchases are ""a longer-term possibility for us"" but will not come in ""the nearest term."" 
Occidental is the only producer ""not giving meaningful cash returns back to investors"" as oil prices approach a seven-year high, despite a ""pretty material"" potential to do so after raising its free cash flow yield, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Douglas Leggate said on Friday. 
The company can increase dividends without significant production growth in the coming years, Hollub said. Oil prices could remain well above $50 to $60 per barrel for up to five years, she said during a Federal Reserve energy conference on Friday. 
Occidental production is expected to stay at 1.14 million barrels of oil and gas per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter, from 1.16 million bpd in the previous three months.

Capital spending is expected to increase in the fourth quarter due to maintenance activities in the company's three business segments, it said.
Its profit more than doubled to $836 million in the third quarter from the previous three months, beating market estimates.

Even though global supply chain constraints and high inflation could mar the technology industry’s growth in the near term, FAANG stocks are again attracting attention after reporting strong third-quarter results. The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep benchmark interest rates unchanged should act as a growth catalyst. Furthermore, increasing demand for advanced tech products and services amid the accelerating digital transformation of several businesses should keep driving the technology industry's growth.

The pan-European STOXX 600 ended flat, but clocked 1.7% in weekly gains, its fifth consecutive week in the green.
European travel stocks jumped 1.4% as investors across the globe cheered Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s trial of an experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19, which was shown to cut risk of developing severe disease by 89%.

Dovish moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and similar comments from the European Central Bank chief have helped sentiment this week.

Investing.com —  Deciphera Pharmaceuticals  LLC (NASDAQ:DCPH) stock plunged Friday after the company announced results from its Phase 3 trial of QINLOCK in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) previously treated with imatinib.
 The study failed to meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival compared with the standard of care, which is Pfizer's) sunitinib.
Deciphera stock is down 74.92% at $9.03. 
“While we are disappointed with these results, which we learned yesterday, we believe this was a robust, well-designed, and well-executed study,"" said Steve Hoerter, president and CEO of Deciphera.

Taylor Dart explains why investors should now consider buying high-quality miners like  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC), Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD), and SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM).It’s been a disappointing 12-month stretch for the Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)), with the index plummeting more than 30% from its Q3 2020 highs, with miners combating inflationary pressures with little help from the gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) price. While this has only led to low to mid-single-digit cost increases for most miners, the combination of no pricing power combined with higher fuel costs and materials costs have put a significant dent in the shares prices of many producers. The good news is that while we have seen a bit of a pinch in margins, all-in sustaining cost margins are still up more than 55% from FY2020 levels, up from ~$450/oz to closer to $700/oz. This means that the average gold producer is still very profitable, and we’re seeing this show up in their free cash flow, with several producers electing to buy back shares, pay dividends but also have room to stockpile cash. In this update, we’ll look at three of the most attractively priced names within the GDX and their ideal buy-points.
(Source: TC2000.com)
Many investors prefer to play the gold price with the GLD or the Gold Miners Index, and while this approach made a ton of sense in 2011 – 2018 when margins were low, and few miners paid dividends or bought back shares, it makes much less sense now. This is because the average producer million-ounce gold producer is paying a dividend yield of more than 2.70%, double that of the S&P-500 (SPY). So, with investors being paid to wait, holding miners looks to be a better strategy, especially because valuations support meaningful upside in the sector. This is because the average producer is trading at a discount to net asset value, which we have not seen since March 2020, and early 2019. For those unfamiliar, the average gold producer gained more than 40% over the next nine months in both instances, and I would not rule out a similar upside over the next year or a trade back to $40.00 on the GDX. Let’s take a look at three names that are trading at deep discounts to their peers, which include Kinross Gold (KGC), Royal Gold (RGLD), and SSR Mining (SSRM).

But since concerns over production declines and inflation could cause these stocks to suffer a pullback in the near term, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound micro-cap stocks Lee Enterprises (LEE), Friedman Industries (FRD), Lifeway Foods (LWAY), and Educational Development (EDUC). So, let’s take a closer look at these names.An upbeat job market, and the Fed’s announcement that it will now begin tapering its asset-purchase program based on its confidence that the economy is now able to handle persistent issues on its own, have been fueling the stock market’s rally. Consequently, most large-cap stocks are currently trading at lofty valuations.
However, rising inflation, supply-chain logjams, reduced production, and an expanded trade deficit are worrying to investors regarding a potential market correction as a result. Because high-priced stocks could suffer a pullback if there is a market correction in the near term, we think micro-cap stocks from relatively stable industries could be smart bets now. Indeed, the iShares Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) has gained 8.9% over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 6.4% returns, indicating investors’ interest in micro-cap stocks given the support from the continuing low-interest-rate environment.
We believe undervalued micro-cap stocks Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (LEE), Friedman Industries, Incorporated (FRD), Lifeway Foods, Inc.

Each of these stocks is rated ‘Strong Buy’ in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>",Gene linked to doubling risk of COVID-19 death found by UK scientists,"By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - British scientists have identified a version of a gene that may be associated with double the risk of lung failure from COVID-19, a finding that provides new insights into why some people are more susceptible than others to severe illness and which opens possibilities for targeted medicine.
The high-risk genetic variant is in a chromosome region that is also tied to double the risk of death in COVID-19 patients under age 60.
Around 60% of people with South Asian ancestry carry the high-risk version of the gene, researchers at Oxford University said on Friday, adding the discovery may partly explain the high number of deaths seen in some British communities, and the devastation wrought by COVID-19 in the Indian subcontinent. 
The scientists found the increased risk comes from a gene that regulates activity of other genes, including one called LZTFL1 involved in the response of lung cells to viruses. 
As a result, the gene variant could inhibit proper response to the virus among cells lining airways and the lungs.
However, LZTFL1 does not affect the immune system that makes antibodies to fight off infections, researchers said, adding that people carrying the variant should respond normally to vaccines.
The study ""shows that the way in which the lung responds to the infection is critical. This is important because most treatments have focussed on changing the way in which the immune system reacts to the virus,"" said Professor James Davies, co-lead of the study.
Dr. Raghib Ali of the University of Cambridge, an adviser on COVID-19 and ethnicity to the UK Cabinet Office, said in a statement that even after accounting for higher rates of COVID-19 risk factors such as work in public-facing jobs and housing in densely populated areas, ""there has been an unexplained residual excess risk in South Asians."" 
This new study, he added, shows ""that this may be due to them being more likely to carry this gene which increases their risk of death once infected.""

The findings were published in the Nature Genetics journal. 
Dr. Simon Biddie, an intensive care specialist at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement that while the study ""provides compelling evidence to suggest roles for LZFTL1"" in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19, more research is necessary to confirm the findings.

The office of Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said on Friday that she and Republican Tom Cotton had introduced a bill targeting such companies as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The bill would make it easier for the government to stop deals it believes break antitrust law by requiring the companies to prove to a judge that the deals are good for competition, and therefore legal.
A similar bill, introduced by Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries and others, has been approved in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and awaits a vote by the full House.
Traditionally it is up to the government in antitrust enforcement to show a particular transaction would cause prices to rise or is illegal for other reasons.
""We're increasingly seeing companies choose to buy their rivals rather than compete,"" Klobuchar said in a statement. 
""This bipartisan legislation will put an end to those anticompetitive acquisitions by making it more difficult for dominant digital platforms to eliminate their competitors and enhance the platform's market power.""

Working with others, Klobuchar introduced a bill in October that would bar Big Tech platforms from favoring their products and services.
Other bills introduced seek to rein in the outsized market power of tech firms, including industry leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Thus far none has become law, although one, which would increase resources for antitrust enforcers, passed the Senate.

The release, which said the grocer would accept the cryptocurrency this holiday season, appeared on Kroger (NYSE:KR)'s investor relations page and was later deleted. 
The company said the page, which gets automatically updated, receives a direct feed from PR Newswire (PRN), where the fake release also appeared.
""This communication was fraudulent and is unfounded and should be disregarded,"" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement, adding that Kroger was in touch with PRN on the issue.
PRN pulled the fake announcement and said it was ""urgently investigating the incident including looking into any criminal activity associated with this matter"". 
Bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin's underlying software code formed in 2017, and was an initiative headed by a small group of mostly China-based bitcoin miners. (https://reut.rs/3bL8MNO)
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc was subject to a cryptocurrency hoax in September when a fake press release was published, announcing a partnership between the world's largest retailer and litecoin. The news had briefly sent prices of the little known cryptocurrency surging.
Despite a string of hoaxes, cyptocurrencies are gaining acceptance among mainstream investors and companies such as theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc, which said in September that it would accept bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin for ticket purchases in the coming months.

Expedia’s net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the quarter nearly matched the same pre-pandemic time. Vice Chairman and CEO Peter Kern said the current quarter is showing early positive signs with many countries announcing new openings to international travelers, “We are feeling increasingly confident about a continued recovery”.
Stayed room nights grew 59% compared to falling nearly as much in the third quarter last year. As a result, lodging revenue rose. Tariffs were also higher and so was the contribution of U.S. hotels in the revenue mix.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Friday set a goal for driving down the cost of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as part of a U.S. plan to decarbonize the economy by 2050. 
The Department of Energy's Carbon Negative Earthshot seeks to slash the cost of carbon removal to $100 a tonne by the end of the decade, either through Direct Air Capture (DAC) or helping forests and other natural systems capture and store the gas. 
It is the department's third ""Earthshot"", meant to help achieve Biden's climate goals, by driving innovations in the toughest technologies to crack. The first two set goals on lowering costs of green hydrogen and long-term utility scale battery storage of energy from renewables.
""We have already poisoned the atmosphere, we have to repair and heal the Earth and the only way to do that is to remove carbon dioxide permanently,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said while introducing the initiative at the COP26 U.N. climate talks https://www.reuters.com/business/cop in Glasgow, Scotland. 
In Iceland, Swiss startup Climeworks AG in September opened the world's largest plant to suck carbon dioxide from the air and pump it underground where it eventually becomes rock, one of 15 global DAC plants. But costs can hit $600 a tonne and the plants now only remove an amount of carbon equivalent to that emitted by 2,000 cars.
Fatih Birol, head of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, praised the initiative as an example of how governments can help push down technology costs that energy markets cannot do alone. ""We need governments to push the magic button of innovation,"" he said.
Jennifer Wilcox, head of the DOE's office of fossil energy and carbon management, said using natural systems to remove carbon must surpass hurdles, such as making sure forest fires or future farming do not simply return carbon back to the atmosphere. ""Part of this work will be defining what metrics (are) in order to monitor and verify storage on a long term scale"" for nature-based approaches, Wilcox said. 
The carbon negative initiative will be funded through the Energy Department's annual appropriations. In addition, the bipartisan infrastructure bill has about $3.5 billion in incentives for DAC demonstration projects. That bill has already passed the U.S. Senate and that the House of Representatives could vote on it as soon as Friday. 
Carbon Engineering, a Canada-based company, plans to open a DAC plant in West Texas in 2024. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Occidental (NYSE:OXY) and billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Gates have all invested in DAC.

Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's first chief environmental officer, said carbon removal markets need to mature significantly and the new U.S. price target can lead to ""learning by doing"".
Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit said, ""We don't know which technology will work, frankly we don't know if any of them will work, but we damn well should be investing and trying to get the price under $100.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeking approval from U.S. communications regulators to deploy more than 4,500 additional satellites as part of the company's effort to deliver broadband internet to areas around the world that lack high-speed service.
Amazon had said previously it planned to spend at least $10 billion to build 3,236 such satellites through its Project Kuiper program. Late on Thursday it asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to deploy a total of 7,774 satellites for the project.
On Monday, Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites by the end of 2022.
Amazon said in its filing the satellites ""will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.""
""Although connectivity has improved on a global basis, only 51% of the global population, and 44% of the population of developing countries, are online,"" the company filing said.
In 2020, the FCC approved the Project Kuiper plan for the constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. 
Amazon has sparred with Musk, recently accusing the billionaire of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin had challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX but a judge rejected the challenge on Thursday.
SpaceX has deployed more than 1,700 satellites.
Earlier this week, the FCC approved Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access.

Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low-Earth orbit satellites.

The financing is backed by a consortium of 14 banks and 10 investors, including Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp, Fortress Investment Group, Oaktree Capital Management and Michael Milken's family office, one of the sources said.
Ares is leading a $2.2 billion preferred equity investment in support of Allen's financing package, another of the sources added.
Tegna could choose a winning bidder as early as this month, the sources said.
Spokespeople for Tegna, Apollo, Oaktree and Michael Milken declined to comment.
Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, made a $23 per share offer for Tegna in September, while Apollo and Standard General offered $22 per share, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Tegna wants both bidders to raise their offers, one of the sources said. It also expects assurances from both bidders that they will entertain all regulatory demands necessary to complete the acquisition, and views the Apollo/Standard General bid as most likely to raise antitrust concerns, the source added. 
Apollo owns 33 TV stations in 20 markets through its portfolio company Cox Media Group, while Standard General owns four TV stations, according to their websites.

Tegna reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday and said on a call with analysts it was still evaluating acquisition proposals versus its stand-alone prospects.

Investing.com —  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares tumbled 23% on Friday after the company trimmed its vaccine sales forecast, citing production issues. 
The company also fell short of profit and sales expectations in the third quarter, reporting an EPS of $7.70 on revenue of $5 billion. 
Moderna said production issues have pushed back some of its deliveries to 2022. Moderna expects deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine in FY 2021 to be between 700 million and 800 million, down from the previous 800 million to 1 billion range. 
""Key variables impacting output include longer delivery lead times for international shipments and exports that may shift deliveries to early 2022, temporary impact from expansion of fill/finish capacity and ramp-up of product release to market,"" the pharmaceutical company said. 
Moderna projects sales to be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion in 2022. 
In addition, news that  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has developed a Covid pill is also weighing on Moderna's share price. The company said its Covid-19 pill, used with an HIV drug, can cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% in high-risk adults.
It's been a rough couple of days for Moderna shareholders, with its stock closing down17% on Thursday after the earnings report. Earlier this week, Moderna disclosed that it would delay filing for approval for its vaccine for young children after the FDA asked for additional time to evaluate the vaccine for use in adolescents.
Moderna shares are trading at $217.17 as of midday."

LONDON (Reuters) - In Britain, there is even a shortage of crunch.
After enduring panic buying at the fuel pumps and soaring heating prices, the British must now brave a new shortage: crisps, or potato chips, one of the country's favourite snacks.
Crisp shelves in supermarkets and shops across the land have been left bare after an IT system upgrade at Walkers, Britain's biggest producer. The deficit could last weeks.
Walkers, owned by PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), said although issues around the system upgrade had been fixed, factories will not ramp up to close to full production until towards the end of November, meaning reduced volume and range at retailers.
""A recent IT system upgrade has disrupted the supply of some of our products. Our sites are still making crisps and snacks but at a reduced scale,"" said a spokesperson for Walkers, which is based in Leicester, central England.
""We’re doing everything we can to increase production and get people’s favourites back on shelves. We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.""
Walkers is prioritising production of its most popular crisps flavours, including Cheese & Onion, Ready Salted and Salt & Vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits from its snacks range.
But shortages of Walkers crisps have pushed consumers to buy other brands, thus emptying shelves in a year that has seen supply chains strained by a post-Brexit shortage of truck drivers and the global supply hiccups caused by COVID.
In August, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) pulled milkshakes and bottled drinks from its menu, and fellow fast food chain Nando's shut around 50 sites due to staffing shortages in its chicken supply chain.
THE CRISP
Crisps are one of Britain's favourite snacks, popped into packed lunches for children, gobbled alongside pints in pubs, or eaten semi-secretly on sofas as a condiment to television drama.
The British gorged on such quantities of snacks during COVID-19 lockdowns that the government sponsored advertisements beseeching people to eat more healthily.
On average people in Britain eat around two 25-gram bags of potato crisps per week, and 141,000 metric tonnes of crisps are sold each year in the country, according to data from market researcher Kantar.
""I'm upset: now I have to go out shopping again,"" said Carole Moore, a 69-year old pensioner from Plaistow, east London, who was searching for crisps on an empty aisle at Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest supermarket group.
Moore, shopping for a bonfire night party of 22 people, was unable to find any multipacks of her favourite Prawn Cocktail and Salt & Vinegar crisps at the Tesco superstore in Beckton. 
The invention of crisps in the early 19th century is a subject of historical dispute, with various legends and claimants on both sides of the Atlantic. 
By the 20th century, crisps had become big business. Walkers was founded in 1948 in Leicester by a local butcher who switched to crisps from meat due to post-World War Two rationing.

The UK market value of crisps, popcorn, nuts and other savoury snacks rose 13.1% to 3.8 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) in the year to Dec. 27, 2020, says Kantar.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd and three of its units had their shares suspended from trading on Friday, a day after an affiliate missed a payment to onshore investors as China's snowballing property debt crisis jolts other developers.
Shenzhen-based homebuilder Kaisa, which has guaranteed the wealth management product, said in a statement on Thursday it was facing unprecedented liquidity pressure due to a challenging property market and rating downgrades. 
Kaisa and its unit Kaisa Prosperity said in separate exchange filings on Friday that trading in their shares was being suspended pending the release of ""inside information"". The companies did not elaborate.
Reuters reported last month, citing sources, that Kaisa was seeking buyers for its property management unit Kaisa Prosperity and two residential sites in Hong Kong, as it scrambles to meet a wall of debt repayments.
Kaisa's troubles come amid concerns about a broadening liquidity crisis in the Chinese property sector, with a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in the developers' shares and bonds in recent weeks.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt coming due over the next year of any Chinese developer after embattled China Evergrande Group, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities.
A finance unit of Kaisa had missed a payment on a wealth management product (WMP), the developer said on Thursday, adding it was raising funds to ease the pressure by taking measures including speeding up asset sales.
Kaisa is planning to sell 18 of its assets in Shenzhen city, mostly retail and commercial properties, worth a total of 81.8 billion yuan ($12.78 billion) by the end of 2022, according to a document seen by Reuters on Friday.
The proceeds will be used to repay the wealth management products. The developer also has 95 urban renewal projects in Shenzhen, valued at 614 billion yuan, which can help replenish its capital after sales upon completion or early disposal.
Media outlet Cailianshe, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter, reported that state-owned enterprises including China Resources Land were in talks to buy some of Kaisa's urban renewal projects in the southern city.
China Resources did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Kaisa also did not comment.
DEEPENING LOSSES 
Kaisa has about $3.2 billion in offshore senior notes due in the next 12 months, with the next maturity worth $400 million falling on Dec. 7. It has coupon payments totalling over $59 million due on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.
On Friday, a sub-index tracking the mainland property sector fell 2.8%, deepening its losses in the past two weeks to 17.8%. An index of real estate A-shares also fell 2.1%.
Shares of Evergrande, once China's largest property developer and whose debt woes have sparked a liquidity crisis across China's $5 trillion property sector, fell 2.5% to their lowest close since Sept. 21.
The company's 11.5% October 2022 bond issued by its unit Scenery Journey fell more than 10% on Friday morning to yield above 300%, according to Duration Finance, leading sharp falls across developers' bonds.
Evergrande narrowly averted a default for the second time last week, but faces another hard deadline on Nov. 10 for more than $148 million in coupon payments that had been due on Oct. 11.
Scenery Journey has coupon payments totalling more than $82 million due Nov. 6, though the bonds' terms grant a 30-day grace period on such payments.
An ETF tracking Asian high-yield dollar bonds fell as much as 1.6%, while spreads on Chinese high-yield dollar debt hovered near record highs.
Developers have scrambled to ease short-term liquidity squeezes as they face looming debt repayments and tighter financing conditions. 
Yango Group, which earlier this week reached a deal with investors to delay principal payments on asset-backed securities, agreed with investors to extend the payment of its 636.5 million yuan onshore bond due Nov. 19 by one year, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. 
""Kaisa could likely be another Evergrande,"" said Raymond Cheng, head of China research at CGS-CIMB Securities, adding that the companies' woes had intensified market concerns over developers' liquidity conditions. 
""Even though the regulators have some easing measures ... it seems that may not be able to help that much,"" he said. ""Unless the government has aggressive loosening measures ... we expect to see more and more developers have problems (paying) off their debts.""

Local authorities in Shenzhen said in a statement on Friday they would strictly implement policies on property market regulation and guard against speculation.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 12:17PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Italy opens new probe into Boeing 787 parts supplier MPS -sources,"By Francesca Landini
BRINDISI (Reuters) - Prosecutors in southern Italy have opened an investigation into the supply of parts to Boeing (NYSE:BA) by Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS), a company at the centre of latest snags on the 787 Dreamliner, three people familiar with the matter said.
According to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and another briefed on the probe, the move aims to verify whether components were flawed and could pose safety risks - a prospect denied by Boeing and MPS' lawyer.
It is the second probe involving Brindisi-based MPS, which is already under court administration amid an ongoing investigation into the bankruptcy of a predecessor company, and follows the intervention of an anonymous whistleblower, the sources said.
Last month, Boeing said some titanium 787 Dreamliner parts provided by MPS via Italian group Leonardo had been improperly manufactured over the past three years. 
It said the issue - one of several production-related problems that have plagued the wide-body jetliner - does not affect the immediate safety of flights. 
The issues facing MPS highlight aerospace's reliance on a dispersed and sometimes fragile global supply chain.
CONTROL CHAIN
MPS's role was until recently to provide small titanium parts and coat components with chemicals to make them smooth and resistant. The company, which employs less than 40 workers, has also been a supplier to several other aerospace companies.
""Prosecutors are checking the chain of controls over quality to understand why the issue (with MPS' components) was unveiled only recently,"" one of the sources told Reuters.
A court-appointed administrator for MPS did not reply to an email requesting comment. 
A lawyer for MPS's owner, Italian entrepreneur Antonio Ingrosso, and for the company denied any safety issue.
""These are non-sensitive parts as far as aircraft safety is concerned and have been widely controlled by MPS' clients,"" Francesca Conte told Reuters.
""We will demonstrate at the appropriate time that it is unfounded to speak of technical flaws in the components supplied by MPS,"" she added.
Boeing declined comment on the probe, which could last for several months.
""Boeing and Leonardo are victims of potential misbehaviour by the sub-supplier... we are cooperating with authorities and we don't have indications to provide so far,"" Leonardo's General Manager Valerio Cioffi said during a results presentation on Friday.
Last month Leonardo said it was an injured party and would not bear any potential costs associated with the issue, adding that MPS was no longer a supplier. Boeing has also dropped MPS from its sub-suppliers' list.
Flanked by palm trees in an industrial area of Brindisi, the gates of MPS's headquarters were closed and a Reuters reporter saw no sign of activity at its two plants on a recent visit.
The latest investigation comes as Brindisi prosecutors near completion of an earlier probe into the bankruptcy of MPS' predecessor company Processi Speciali, the sources said.
The company rented its assets to MPS before going bankrupt in 2018, they added.

In May, Ingrosso was initially detained and then placed under house arrest as part of the bankruptcy probe. Ingrosso, who has since been released, did not respond directly to a request for comment. His lawyer denied he had a key role in the bankruptcy of Processi Speciali, adding Ingrosso tried to save the company when it encountered financial difficulties.
Former employees of the company have hit back at the claims, saying the company has been unfairly targeted.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc on Thursday slashed its full-year sales forecast by up to $1 billion, saying demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills was slowing faster than expected as people return to pre-pandemic habits.
Its shares dove 31% in extended trading, on course to wipe off about $8 billion from the market value of a company that was among the biggest corporate winners of last year's lockdowns. 
""It is clear that we underestimated the reopening impact on our company and the overall industry,"" Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said on a post-earnings call.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) now expects https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee annual sales between $4.4 billion and $4.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion previously. Its holiday-quarter sales forecast also missed market expectations. 
""People are no longer trapped at home and competition is growing,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said.
Rising vaccinations and easing curbs have encouraged people to go back to gyms this year, hitting Peloton's growth and boosting the earnings of chains like Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) Inc.
The company has tried to cushion the blow by cutting the price of its popular bike by $400 and ramping up its ad spending. But its sales rose just 6.2% in the three months to Sept. 30, the slowest pace since in more than a year. 
Sales and marketing expenses more than doubled to account for 35.3% of total revenue in the first quarter and were expected to remain high in the crucial holiday period.

Peloton has also grappled with global chip crunch, supply disruptions and rising freight costs that have piled on the expenses.
That in part plunged it to a net loss of $376 million, from a profit of $69.3 million a year earlier.

Hit by the development, Emergent cut the top end of its annual revenue guidance by $100 million to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Third-quarter total revenue fell 15%, to $329 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday restored the fraud convictions of two former top executives at the now-defunct Platinum Partners hedge fund, saying a trial judge erred in acquitting one defendant and granting the other a new trial.
In a 102-page decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said sufficient evidence supported the July 2019 jury convictions of Platinum co-founder Mark Nordlicht and co-chief investment officer David Levy.
The appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn for sentencing. Platinum was based in Manhattan and once had about $1.7 billion of assets.
Lawyers for Nordlicht and Levy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The office of U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn declined to comment.
Both defendants were convicted of securities fraud and two conspiracy charges for cheating bondholders at the Platinum-controlled Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations LLC, to limit Platinum's losses if Black Elk went bankrupt.
Prosecutors said the scheme involved diverting nearly $100 million from sales in 2014 of Black Elk oil fields, after rigging a bondholder vote to ensure that Platinum and not bondholders would be paid first.
Black Elk creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against that company in August 2015.
In September 2019, Cogan ordered a new trial for Nordlicht, saying it would be ""manifest injustice"" to uphold his conviction after Nordlicht went to ""great lengths"" during the vote to follow rules governing a Platinum affiliate.
Cogan also ordered Levy's acquittal, saying prosecutors had not proven he had criminal intent.
But in Friday's 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Robert Sack said the evidence ""did not preponderate heavily"" against Nordlicht's conviction, and rational jurors could have found that Levy had criminal intent.
Trial judges rarely overturn jury verdicts.

In a separate case in Manhattan, Platinum co-founder Murray Huberfeld was sentenced in June to seven months in prison for his role in a bribery scheme involving Norman Seabrook, the convicted former chief of New York City's correction officers' union.
The case is U.S. v. Levy et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-3207.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>",Italy's Banco BPM to take insurance in-house in new plan,"By Andrea Mandala and Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Banco BPM said on Friday it planned to acquire full ownership of its insurance partnerships as part of a new multi-year plan that aims to achieve net profit of more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in 2024.
The new profit target and quarterly results, which were both ahead of analyst expectations, drove shares in Italy's third-largest bank up as much as up 5.6%, outperforming a 1% rise for Milan's blue-chip index.
Banco BPM will exercise rights to bring in house its insurance joint-ventures with Italy's Cattolica, which was recently acquired by Generali (MI:GASI), and Britain's  Aviva  (LON:AV).
Banco BPM also runs a consumer finance business in tandem with France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), while it relies on Anima, of which it owns 19.4%, for asset management.
The Italian bank is taking its lead from Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), which has weathered a tough environment of negative interest rates better than other banks thanks to its wealth management and insurance businesses. 
UBI, another mid-sized player like Banco BPM, had also planned to bring insurance in-house before receiving an unsolicited takeover bid from Intesa.
Banco BPM, created in 2017 from the merger of two regional cooperative banks, wants to make net fees its main profit driver, growing 8% annually on average over the 2021-2024 period to more than offset stagnating net interest income.
Overall revenues are projected to rise 2.4% a year.
The new net profit target compares with the 649 million euros Banco BPM made in 2019, before the pandemic. 
""The focus Banco BPM puts on its 'product companies' and especially those in 'bancassurance' we believe may contribute to improve the value of the group in an M&A scenario"", Bestinver analyst Fabrizio Bernardi said.
Banco BPM has been has looking for a merger partner after mid-tier rival UBI was snapped up by Intesa last year.
CEO Giuseppe Castagna has failed to agree a deal with BPER Banca and said on Friday consolidation had paused.
""We're very happy to be 'standalone' now because we've got ambitious targets to reach"", he said. 
He added Banco BPM would continue to pay attention to every possible merger opportunity. 
With its roots in the wealthy Lombardy region, Banco BPM is widely seen as the perfect geographical fit for UniCredit, which is under pressure to boost its domestic footprint and catch up with Intesa, but last month walked away from the acquisition of state-owned Monte dei Paschi.
Castagna said Banco BPM had no interest in Monte dei Paschi or Banca Carige, another rescue candidate, because their size did not fit with his bank's plans. 
Banco BPM on Friday reported a third-quarter net profit of 110.7 million euros, well above a 78 million euro Reuters-compiled consensus.

It set a 40% dividend payout ratio under the multi-year plan, which analysts see as conservative, leaving the bank with a capital buffer for potential deals.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Bain Capital has kicked off preparations to list digital consulting firm Brillio on the U.S. stock market early next year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Brillio has hired investment banks  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to help it prepare for an initial public offering (IPO), the sources said. 
The company could seek a valuation including debt of $3 billion or more, one of the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the IPO preparations are confidential, and cautioned that the timing and size of the deal could change. 
Bain, Brillio and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. 
Remote working during pandemic-induced lockdowns over the past 18 months has led to a spike in demand for information technology services and provided a boost to technology consulting vendors such as Brillio. 
Brillio offers clients technology services including cloud-based applications, analytics solutions and software maintenance. 
The Edison, New Jersey-based company was spun out of information technology recruiting and staffing services firm Collabera in 2014. Bain acquired a majority stake in 2019.

Brillio has been led by former  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) executive Raj Mamodia since its inception. 
Over the past decade, Bain has invested in other technology services firms such as Genpact (NYSE:G) and Quest Global.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A group of climate activists convicted for a protest against Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) applied on Friday for a review by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in a step their lawyers said could set a precedent for such cases.
A Swiss appeals court last year reversed a ruling that had acquitted the 12 climate activists of trespassing at Credit Suisse on the grounds their actions were necessitated by the ""imminent danger"" of global warming. That decision was later upheld by Switzerland's top court. 
The case went to court after protesters refused to pay a fine for trespassing in a branch in November 2018, when they had pretended to be tennis superstar Roger Federer to highlight his sponsorship by the bank, which finances fossil fuel projects.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on an ongoing court case. A spokesman for Switzerland's second largest bank said its sponsorship partnership with Federer and a partnership with the Roger Federer Foundation were both still in place.
Federer has previously expressed gratitude to climate activists ""for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions"". A spokesperson for his Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Some of the 12 activists delivered the appeal, known as an 'application', at the Strasbourg court. Wearing sweat bands and sneakers they played a tennis match outside, using a banner reading '#RogerForClimate' as a make-shift net. 
""This case is one of the first and it could create a European precedent,"" Raphaël Mahaim, one of the lawyers for the activists, told Reuters from Strasbourg.
A spokesperson for the court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The activists' request coincides with a youth rally through Glasgow to demand that leaders at the U.N. COP26 climate conference https://www.reuters.com/business/cop safeguard their future.
A growing portion of climate justice cases are invoking human rights and that may increase after the U.N. rights council recognised access to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental right.

Cover against cyber attacks is one of the business lines likely to register the biggest increases, he said.
Insurance rates have been rising sharply as insurers have suffered hefty claims for issues such as floods and wildfires, cyber attacks and the cancellation of events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, the expansion of data centers, the rollout of 5G, business automation, and remote lifestyles are also driving the technology market’s growth.
However, the pandemic-driven tech boom is gradually slowing down, and many companies in the sector face production delays due to semiconductor chip shortages and supply chain disruptions.

Investing.com —  Penn National Gaming Inc  (NASDAQ:PENN) stock has clawed back some of yesterday's losses, currently up over 9% after Prescience Point Capital said it is long the stock.
Penn shares closed Thursday's session down over 15% after initially falling around 21%. The decline began after the company reported an earnings miss before the bell. However, the drop was exacerbated following an article from Business Insider that made allegations against Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. 
Portnoy himself has come out via Twitter to refute the article.
Penn bought a 36% stake in Barstool in early 2020, while Portnoy has said via Twitter that he owns ""a ton of Penn stock.""
Following the allegations, Ryan Sigdahl, an analyst at Craig-Hallum, said that while it is hard to handicap the potential ramifications of the article, the weakness shown in Penn shares is a buying opportunity. 
However, Prescience Point Capital went a step further, tweeting that they ""are long $PENN. The sharp selloff from the @stoolpresidente article reflects a huge dislocation from actual biz fundamentals. Core casino business alone is worth +$75/share, +30% from here + free option of @barstoolsports. All-in we think $PENN can +2x.""








In a lengthy thread outlining their bullish position, Prescience said that while Portnoy may be making the headlines, Penn is still a regional gaming operator with one of the best management teams in the business. 
""Over the past few months $PENN has steadily gained share. Once the dust settles, Barstool's brand loyalty will differentiate itself from competitors, generating sticky, high margin revenue,"" Prescience added.
So far on Friday, Penn shares have climbed to a high of $63.30."

The Toronto, Ontario-based company, which typically makes around half of its annual sales during the holiday quarter, said it expects an adjusted profit of C$1.17 to C$1.33 per share in fiscal 2022, above analysts' estimate of C$1.13, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
Known for its bright red parkas, Canada Goose also benefited from Chinese consumers who continued to purchase its jackets despite fresh lockdowns in some cities, helping the company beat revenue expectations for the tenth consecutive quarter.

Canada Goose, set to launch its footwear collection this month, reported revenue of C$232.9 million ($186.69 million) in the second quarter ended Sept. 26, topping analysts' estimates of C$206.1 million.

Investing.com — Shares of robotic medical device manufacturer  Rewalk Robotics Ltd  (NASDAQ:RWLK) jumped 40% on Friday after it was awarded Breakthrough Device Designation by the Food and Drug Administration for its ReBoot device.
Rewalk Robotics stock is trading at $1.81 in early morning trading.
""Breakthrough device designation from the FDA is a critical milestone for the ReBoot, as it provides a more streamlined review pathway that can get this uniquely innovative device to market faster,"" said Larry Jasinski, CEO of ReWalk.
The Massachusetts-based company's ReBoot device is a battery-powered orthotic exo-suit intended to help mobility in people with reduced ankle function linked to neurological injuries, such as a stroke.
The Breakthrough Device designation expedites development, assessment, and review to give patients quicker access to medical devices. 
Jasinski said the device will “give stroke survivors a device customizable for each individual user, giving them the opportunity for regular assistance at home and in the community. ”
The company will now go down the FDA approval route for the device. It will first finalize the design and development and will then advance to the clinical studies required."

Investing.com –  MercadoLibre  stock (NASDAQ:MELI) soared 8% Friday as the Latin American ecommerce giant continued to ride the pandemic wave and its various initiatives in logistics and fintech in the third quarter to beat analysts’ estimates.
The Argentine company reached new records in gross merchandise volume, payment volumes and credit portfolio size during the September quarter.
Gross merchandise volume, the most-commonly used metric to determine the growth of an ecommerce company, signifying the value of goods sold on the platform, rose 24%, to $7.3 billion.
It sold almost 260 million items in the third quarter, up  26% year over year. The company posted a more than 3% rise in unique active users to 78.7 million across its operation.
Revenue growth was strong in all its three key markets of Argentina (38% rise), Mexico (94%) and Brazil (74%). All three geographies improved in transactions per buyer versus the previous quarter. The company said more products from  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Enjoei, Nivea and PlayStation were found at its marketplace in Brazil, as well as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and Asics added to its Mexico platform.
The company established another fulfilment center in Mexico to take on the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and homegrown brand Magazine Luiza.
Net revenue for the third quarter rose over 66%, to $1.9 billion. Adjusted profit per share was $1.92 and beat estimates."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday with cyclicals outperforming after a strong labor market report for October showed the U.S. economy in robust health. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 308 points, or 0.9% at 36,432 points, a new record high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both followed, rising 0.7% and 0.5% respectively.
Earlier, the Labor Department said that the U.S. economy created 531,000 nonfarm jobs net in the month through mid-October, well above consensus forecasts of 450,000. It also revised up September's surprisingly weak figure by nearly 120,000 to 312,000. The data showed that the summer slowdown due to the Delta-variant wave of Covid-19 has almost certainly been overcome. 
At the same time, average hourly earnings growth slowed to 0.4% from 0.6%, in September, meaning that there was no fresh scare about inflationary pressures at the end of a week when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had faced down pressure to accelerate the timeframe for tightening monetary policy. 
Travel and transportation names were among the biggest gainers, after Uber joined rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) in posting a sharp improvement in operating numbers - even though it still lost $2.4 billion in the three months through September due to a massive write-down of its equity stake in Chinese peer Didi Global. Uber  (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 6.7%.  The broader travel industry was also lifted by strong numbers from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), whose stock rose 9.8% in response. 
Arguably the most powerful factor supporting the sector came from pharma giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which reported that its experimental antiviral drug for treating Covid-19 had shown a high degree of effectiveness in treating Covid-19. Pfizer is the second company to make significant progress in bringing an oral antiviral for Covid-19 to market, after Merck last month. Pfizer said its drug had shown an 89% success rate in reducing severe disease, compared to only 50% shown by Merck's drug molnupravir.
Pfizer stock rose 8.9%, while Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock fell 8.7%. Pure-play vaccine stocks also suffered, on perceptions that the widespread availability of antiviral pills will depress long-term demand for vaccination.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell 11.6%, while  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock and BioNTech stock plunged another 19.5% and 17.6% respectively, both hitting four-month lows. 
The news also lifted airline and cruise stocks: Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) stock rose 7.3% while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 4.4%. 
There were further signs of the pandemic receding elsewhere, too. Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 32% after it cut its revenue guidance in an admission that customers are returning to pre-pandemic patterns of exercise faster than it thought. It noted that user engagement with its fitness equipment had fallen markedly in the last quarter, as people returned to gyms or simply eased up on their home fitness regimes.
Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) stock rose 8.0%, clawing back some of the 20% losses it suffered on Thursday after Business Insider published anonymized accusations alleging Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy of sexual violence. Portnoy disputes the allegations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) confirmed Friday it will again halt production at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle, for three more weeks.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules and to address fire risks after a series of fires.
GM said the plant, which halted production in August after the battery recall, now has a targeted return to production date of Dec. 6. The new three-week production halt will start Nov. 15.
Late last month, GM said it would conduct limited production for two weeks at Orion starting Nov. 1 to help optimize battery production and supply chain repair logistics, including providing vehicles to be used as courtesy transportation for customers during recall repairs.
GM said Friday that ""battery module replacements remain the priority. We will continue to adjust Orion’s production schedule moving forward to best support the recall.""
GM President Mark Reuss said last month that the company is addressing the recall before resuming production of new vehicles.
GM has suspended sales of new Bolts. Reuss said GM has to certify Bolt vehicles on dealer lots before they can be sold but did not say when those sales might begin.

GM disclosed in October that its battery partner, South Korea's LG Electronics, had agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion estimated costs and expenses associated with the Bolt recall.
GM and LG Energy Solution are building two joint-venture U.S. battery plants.

The company also cut the upper end of its previous guidance, owing to unfavorable results in some NFL matches in October. At the same time, it raised the midpoint of the guidance.
DraftKings now sees revenue between $1.24 billion and $1.28 billion, compared to the previous forecast of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion. The revised guidance includes a $25 million negative revenue impact primarily due to NFL event outcomes in October.

Revenue rose 60% from last year, to $213 million, and was in line with the company’s guidance but the analysts expected more, their hopes and estimates pinned on the booming business.
With casinos off limits during the pandemic and the company taking its gambling and sport betting offerings to more states (Arizona and Wyoming during the quarter) in the U.S. and Canada, DraftKings couldn’t have asked for more.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 09:02AM ET</span>","A decade on, Fukushima farmers fear nuclear-tainted water's impact on business","By Sakura Murakami
IWAKI, Japan (Reuters) - Fukushima farmers fear the Japanese government's planned release of water from the crippled power plant could revive concerns about contamination and again hit the price of their produce, undoing a decade of slow recovery from nuclear disaster.
Japan plans to release https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disaster-fukushima-water-release-expl-idAFKBN2C003P more than 1 million tonnes of contaminated water from the plant in the country's northeast into the sea after treating it, as the site reaches storage limits for the water. Although international authorities support the plan, it has sparked concern from neighbours China and South Korea and worried local fisherman and farmers.
""We're just about seeing our prices go back to normal after a big drop following the disaster, but now we will have to deal with the potential reputational damage all over again because of the release of the water,"" said Hiroaki Kusano, a pear farmer and vice-leader of the local agricultural co-operative.
The water is to be processed to remove radioactive contamination other than from tritium, which cannot be removed. Water with the radioactive isotope diluted to one-seventh of the World Health Organization's guidelines for drinking water will be released into the Pacific a kilometre out from the plant around spring 2023, under a government plan.
Nuclear plants worldwide routinely release water containing tritium, considered the least-toxic byproduct of atomic power.
Last year, for the first time since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami devastated the northeast coast and triggered the nuclear disaster, the average price of Fukushima pears sold in Tokyo overtook those from some other prefectures, fetching 506 yen per kg ($2.00 per pound), data from the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market showed.
A year after the crisis, prices were at 184 yen per kg, 20% below the average of more than 230 yen for other prefectures. 
Fukushima's produce goes through multiple checks for radioactivity, with farmers screening before shipment, while the prefecture also tests regularly.
Over the last decade, local produce has gone through a ""thorough testing process, consistently"" said Kazuhiro Okazaki of Fukushima's Agricultural Technology Centre, which has screened produce for radioactive cesium since June 2011.
Fukushima produced 13,000 tonnes of pears in 2020, making it Japan's fourth-largest source of the popular fruit, official data showed. 
DECOMMISSIONING
The Daiichi plant is being decomissioned as part of a clean-up by operator Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco) expected to take decades https://jp.reuters.com/article/japan-fukushima-anniversary-decommission-idINKBN2B40XF.
Some 1,000 tanks, each 12 metres (40 feet) tall, crowd the site and hold enough radioactive water to fill around 500 Olympic-sized swimming polls. The release of water that once passed through contaminated areas of the plant marks a milestone in decommissioning and will free up space for the clean-up.
Tepco will compensate for damages related to the water release, said Junichi Matsumoto, a company official overseeing decommissioning work. Tepco says it has so far paid out some 10.1 trillion yen ($89 billion) in damages from the crisis.
""The first step is to listen to the voices of those impacted adversely by the water release,"" Matsumoto said.
There are additional concerns because the Fukushima water has been sitting around for years, said Toru Watanabe, a radioactivity researcher at the Fukushima Fisheries and Marine Science Research Center. 
""The water has been in those tanks for a long time. The quality of that water needs to be thoroughly understood before it's released,"" he said.
Farmers say there isn't much they can do once the water is released. They worry about their tough customers - Japanese shoppers are famously picky about produce and pay close attention to freshness and place of origin. 

""All we can do is keep explaining all of the measures we have to ensure the safety of our produce,"" said pear farmer Tomoichi Yoshioka. ""The final decision lies with the consumer.""

1416,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","House Moves Toward Votes on Biden Economic Plan, Infrastructure","(Bloomberg) -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi maneuvered the House toward a vote Friday on President Joe Biden’s economic package and a separate infrastructure bill, even as she continued 11th-hour discussions to settle lingering differences among Democrats.
The planned vote on the massive tax and spending measure, estimated at more than $1.75 trillion, follows months of intra-party tension and disputes that carried into late Thursday night. Although much of the bill had been written, there were last-minute changes on modifying the state and local income tax deduction and a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.
Approval of the infrastructure measure, already passed by the Senate, will send it directly to Biden’s desk.
As the House convened Friday morning, Pelosi met in her office with a group of moderate Democrats, some of whom had been pressing for a fuller cost analysis of the spending package. The group included Representatives Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Jared Golden of Maine.
Murphy said Thursday night as plans for the vote were being set that she wanted “to understand how much taxpayer money that is being put up in the bill.”
House passage of both measures would deliver a much-needed victory for the president, whose approval ratings have plummeted. A stunning loss for Democrats in the Virginia gubernatorial race and an unexpectedly close call for the incumbent governor of New Jersey generated fresh impetus for the party’s lawmakers to finish work on both the economic package, known as Build Back Better, and an infrastructure measure.
Biden has been directly involved in negotiating with House and Senate Democrats and he made calls to House members on Thursday asking them to vote yes when the bill comes to the floor, a White House official said.
Plans for the vote advanced after Pelosi told three potential holdouts, Representatives Adriano Espaillat of New York, Chuy García of Illinois and Lou Correa of California, that she would make protections for immigrants a top priority once the House finishes with Biden’s economic priorities.
The current text of the broad tax and spending bill includes a parole option that would provide work authorization and deportation protections for some undocumented immigrants. But a more expansive measure likely wouldn’t survive in the Senate.
“All options remain on the table, but we are not drafting new language,” Garcia said in a statement. “Speaker Pelosi shares our concerns for the immigrant community, recognizes their contributions and is committed to keeping immigration in play.”
A last-minute change to the tax and spending plan involved the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT. Instead of moving forward with a proposal to lift the $10,000 SALT cap to $72,500 through 2031, the bill will now raise it to $80,000 through 2030 according to a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The cap would snap back to $10,000 in 2031. Compared to current law where there is no cap after 2025, the provision would raise $14.8 billion in revenue over 10 years. 
The Senate is expected to make its own changes to the SALT proposal. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Bob Menendez of New Jersey have proposed an unlimited cap but would cut off access to the deduction for people with incomes above $400,000 to $500,000. 
Drug Pricing
On drug pricing, Democrats have agreed to give some drugs an extra year of exemption from price negotiations, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
The change means biologic drugs won’t be subject to government price negotiation until 13 years after they are approved for use, one year longer than in the provision that was initially written into the legislation.
That revision was made after Representative Scott Peters of California and Kathleen Rice of New York raised concerns about the language in the legislation and met with Pelosi.
While the House would be giving final passage to the infrastructure legislation, the economic package still faces hurdles -- and changes -- in the Senate. If the legislation is modified there, as expected, it would have to go back to the House for another vote.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said senators would strive to act on the legislation “before Thanksgiving,” which falls on Nov. 25.
But even that schedule may be ambitious. Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, who has fought to trim the size of the package, continues to object to provisions favored by the House, such as paid family leave and immigration. He also said he wants a clearer assessment of the impact of the expansive tax and spending package on inflation and debt.
“I have a lot of concerns, let’s put it that way,” Manchin said Wednesday night on Fox News. “They’re working off the House bill. That’s not going to be the bill I work off of.”
Schumer said he spoke to Manchin Thursday and they both agreed to “work diligently over the break” to come up with something that can be supported by all 50 Democrats in the Senate, which will be out next week.
“There are various sticking points,” he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley said on Friday there were rising litigation risks linked to COVID-19 as economies emerge from the pandemic and workers head back to the office.
Corporate risk has been elevated since the onset of the health crisis, Adrian Cox, who took over as Beazley's chief executive officer earlier this year, said in an interview at the Reuters Future of Insurance Europe conference. 
""There are new risks out there, how do companies manage a hybrid environment, a mixture of working from home and the office. How do they manage vaccinations, how do they manage wearing of masks...these things present new risks for employers.""
""I think drivers of social inflation are here to persist for a while,"" he said.
Insurers define social inflation as a rise in the size of damages awards made by juries. 
Insurers have been scaling back the cover they offer companies in anticipation of a surge in discrimination claims after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs and the gradual return of employees to offices after months of working from home. 
Cox had previously told Reuters that corporations were dealing with questions around what could classify as discrimination as they bring employees back into office buildings. 
His comments on Friday came after the company reported a surge in premiums written thanks to a steady improvement in rates, with Beazley's cyber and executive risk business showing a hefty 48% rise.
However, without giving further details, Cox said there were some parts of the company's portfolio where rate rises were tapering off.

TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co on Friday recommended shareholders of Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd vote for the lender's plan for a poison pill defence against an unsolicited $1.1 billion bid from SBI Holdings Inc.
Mid-sized bank Shinsei opposed SBI's approach last month, saying that the partial takeover offer could hurt interests of minority shareholders and that the offer price was too low. SBI, which owns an online brokerage and a bank, holds around 20% of Shinsei and wants to raise that to up to 48%. 
The recommendation from Glass Lewis is likely to be seen as a setback for SBI, which sees Shinsei as part of a plan to create Japan's fourth-largest bank. Shinsei has said it would accept the offer if SBI raised the price and removed the upper limit on how much it would buy, but SBI rejected those requests.
""Shinsei's independent investors have been presented with a pointedly inequitable partial cash out, to be followed by a significant, one-sided restructuring very likely to involve substantial board and executive turnover and a heavily revised strategic profile,"" Glass Lewis said in its recommendation.
""In a rare case, we believe this framework alone is arguably sufficient to warrant support for Shinsei's proposed defence measures.""
SBI, which says it can overhaul the mid-sized lender, has promised to make every effort to repay the 350 billion yen ($3.1 billion) in public money Shinsei received during a banking crisis two decades ago.
However, Glass Lewis said SBI had offered investors ""no meaningful plan to address this issue"".
Separately, the government-affiliated Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan said on Friday it sent both SBI and Shinsei a set of questions asking specifically how they can increase Shinsei's corporate value. The government owns around 20% of Shinsei.

Shinsei's shares closed down 3% on Friday at 1,808 yen, below SBI's offer price of 2,000 yen a share.

Analysts have said DraftKings and its peers would spend heavily on marketing during the NFL season, with a view to attracting new users in several U.S. states that have legalized online sports betting.
However, unfavorable results in some NFL matches in October forced DraftKings to cut the upper end of its fiscal 2021 outlook, even as it raised the midpoint of the range.

Like other automakers, Honda's production plans have been hit by the chip shortage, with global output in September falling 30% from a year ago, even as demand in key markets, such as China rebounds from a pandemic slump.
""We believed supplies shortages would be limited, but we now see the supply shortage is more serious and will last longer,"" executive vice President Seiji Kuraishi said at a press briefing.
Honda was also dealing with rises in the cost of materials, including steel that were difficult to pass on to consumers, he added.
Honda's latest forecast for a operating profit of 660 billion yen ($5.80 billion) for the year to March 31 is 15% down form a prediction made in August, and lower than a mean forecast of 764.5 billion yen by 20 analysts, Refinitiv data showed.
Japan's No. 2 car company on Friday also cut its vehicle sales plan to 4.2 million vehicles from 4.85 million this business year, down from 4.5 million in the previous 12 months.
On Thursday, larger rival  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) cut its full-year sales target and warned the lack of semiconductors still posed risks to its annual production plans.
Honda's Kuraishi said the company expect chip shortages to ease after March and should not to affect its plans to accelerate a shift to electric cars and other zero-emission vehicles.
The Japanese carmaker is aiming to increase its ratio of EVs and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to 100% of all sales by 2040, with all new models in China be EVs or hybrid cars from 2030.
Honda is also developing self-driving technology, and says it plans to put advanced driver-assistance systems in all of its models in major markets by 2030.

For the three months to Sept. 30, Honda said operating profit fell by almost a third to 198.9 billion yen. That result was higher than an average forecast of 183.5 billion based on estimates from nine analysts, Refinitiv data showed.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - At Oriental Paper Products, a stationery factory outside Beirut, machinery sits idle and shifts have been reduced. The firm was already struggling amid Lebanon's financial crisis; a full-blown diplomatic row with Saudi Arabia has made matters worse.
Last week Riyadh extended a blockade on some goods from Lebanon to a blanket ban, in response to criticism by a Lebanese minister of Saudi Arabia's role in the civil war in Yemen.
The comments exacerbated deteriorating relations between the former allies, with Riyadh increasingly critical of what it says is arch-enemy Iran's growing influence over Lebanon through the powerful armed Hezbollah movement - which Tehran backs.
At Oriental Paper Products and businesses across Lebanon, the impact is already being felt.
The company had been producing $500,000 worth of books and office supplies destined for Saudi Arabia when the ban came into force.
""We already had our problems and now they (Lebanese politicians) increased them. God help the Lebanese,"" Chief Executive Officer Ziad Bekdache told Reuters.
The row comes at a particularly bad time for the Lebanese economy.
Industries had sought to leverage increased competitiveness due to the currency's collapse to boost exports to Saudi Arabia from $240 million in 2020 to $600 million, said Bekdache, also the deputy head of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists.
""Now, it's zero,"" he said, noting several Lebanese companies had begun moving factories to countries including Oman, Turkey and Cyprus to evade the Saudi ban.
Non-food Lebanese exports to Saudi Arabia include aluminium, gold and jewellery, machinery, soaps and paints.
""It's as if there is a plan to break the economic and industrial sectors in Lebanon, in addition to cutting the ties and connections between Lebanon and the world and especially the Gulf and Saudi Arabia,"" Bekdache said.
Lebanon's economy and industry ministers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the impact of the Saudi ban on exports. The Center for Internatonal Communication, the Saudi government media office, also did not immediately respond.
'WHY ARE WE PAYING THE PRICE?'
Lebanese businesses have been battered by one of the worst economic crises in the country's history. That was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and a massive explosion at Beirut's port last year that wrecked parts of the capital.
The Lebanese pound, tethered to the U.S. dollar for more than two decades, has depreciated by more than 90% since 2019, slashing the purchasing power of locals while the global shutdown drastically reduced exports.
Then in April, Saudi Arabia blocked imports of Lebanese agricultural products and food after a spike in drug smuggling that Saudi authorities said Lebanon had failed to address.
Lebanon says it has taken measures to address the problem since then, including several major drug busts.
Last week, Saudi Arabia and four other Gulf nations recalled their envoys to Lebanon and the Saudi foreign minister said the kingdom saw no point in re-engaging so long as Lebanon was dominated by Hezbollah.
Hezbollah have publicly backed Information Minister George Kordahi, whose comments sparked the latest row and who is under pressure from some politicians at home to step down.
This week, Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib called the Saudi demands impossible https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-says-it-wants-dialogue-with-riyadh-not-demands-about-hezbollah-2021-11-02 to meet, and urged Riyadh to resume talks with the government to resolve differences.
Lebanese business leaders have voiced growing frustration.
""Did we create Hezbollah? Do we have an arsenal of rockets? Why do we have to pay the price?"" the head of a Lebanese company with over $1 million in exports to Saudi Arabia said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Some firms had been working to mend ties with Saudi Arabia when the new crisis erupted.
Lebanese businessman Joe Rizk, supply chain manager at Second House Products that makes spice blends and a variety of dry foods, met with the Saudi consul in Beirut the day before Kordahi's comments.
""We were trying to solve it any way possible, but things got complicated again,"" Rizk said from a factory on the outskirts of Beirut.
Before the ban, 20% of his products went to 700 restaurants in Saudi Arabia, Rizk said, and the company has been unable to find alternative buyers ahead of the Islamic holy month of fasting Ramadan next spring, usually peak season for them.

Now he says he is considering moving part of his production abroad, and worries about potential lay-offs.
""We end up paying the price for these very big issues. They're tired of it and we're tired of it,"" Rizk said, referring to Saudi and Lebanese people. ""It's a loss for both, not just for us.""

The contract manufacturer has come under regulatory fire after an accidental mix-up of ingredients ruined about 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine and prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to halt operations at its Baltimore plant earlier this year.
The modification of terms with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will reduce the contract's value to $470.9 million from $650.8 million, Emergent said in a regulatory filing late on Thursday. 
Emergent said in late July it would resume production of J&J's vaccine at the plant following additional FDA reviews. 
The termination of contract with the U.S. government further decreases revenue for Emergent's deteriorating contract drug manufacturing business, Cowen analyst Boris Peaker said in a note. 
The material manufactured for the J&J vaccine at the Baltimore plant prior to the April shutdown and awaiting FDA approval could be enough to produce as many as 50 million shots, Reuters reported last month.

Emergent said on Thursday it was expecting to continue supporting J&J out of its Bayview site. 
Emergent shares have fallen 41% this year up to Thursday's close.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) is ""very optimistic"" about the reopening of transatlantic travel and planning to ramp up capacity on those routes next year, fuelling recovery hopes despite warning of a big loss in 2021.
IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, is more dependent on travel between Britain and the United States than its competitors and so has been hit harder by 19 months of North Atlantic travel shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Friday the full reopening of that route on Monday was ""pivotal,"" and rising capacity would help return the group to profit next year. 
""We are very optimistic and I think we are going to have 100% of the capacity that we flew in 2019 next summer,"" he said, when asked about transatlantic routes. 
""When we can operate our flights, we are going to come back soon to a profitable situation."" 
Shares in IAG opened up 1.8%, before slipping to trade down 2.6%. 
""A bullish guide on capacity restoration into 2022 is the most important thing here,"" Bernstein analyst Alex Irving said. 
But for 2021, IAG warned it was heading for a 3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) loss, hurt by pandemic restrictions for most of the year. 
That guidance was slightly behind analysts' consensus forecast for a loss of 2.87 billion euros, but better than 2020's 4.4 billion euro loss.
IAG's greater exposure to Britain, where travel restrictions were kept stricter for longer compared to the rest of Europe, and its lower exposure to cargo than peers means it has so far trailed European competitors in its recovery.
Air France-KLM has guided to slightly positive earnings for 2021 and Germany's Lufthansa eked out a small quarterly profit for July-September.

Over the summer, usually the most profitable period for airlines, IAG posted an operating loss before exceptional items of 485 million euros for July-September, beating analysts' consensus forecast for a loss of 513 million euros.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's Co-op Bank is looking for more deals with rival banks after its merger approach for TSB was rebuffed last month, its chief executive said on Friday.
The self-styled ethical lender reported a third straight quarter of profits, as it made further progress on its turnaround after nearly a decade of annual losses.
In a sign of its improved fortunes, Co-op Bank is in the market for acquisitions following an unsolicited approach for TSB, which was rejected by Spanish owner Sabadell.
""We want to make sure we're in the best position we can be to take advantage of opportunities should they arise,"" CEO Nick Slape told Reuters.
Takeover interest in Britain's mid-sized banks has picked up in recent weeks, with shares in fellow challenger bank Metro Bank surging 29% on Thursday after it revealed an approach from U.S. private equity giant Carlyle.
Slape said he still believed a tie-up with TSB to create a bank with 65 billion pounds ($87.26 billion) of assets made sense. 
""Scale is definitely an issue for the mid-tiers,"" he said. ""You can't keep cutting costs... you need to turn your attention to diversifying the income line and growing the income line. That's the rationale."" 
Sabadell said last week it has no plans to sell TSB for now. However, Sabadell has made no secret of its desire to refocus on its home market of Spain in the longer term and put TSB up for sale last year only to shelve the plan a few months later.
""Sabadell have made it very clear that now is not the right time,"" Slape said. ""We've left it. We respect that position and have left it like that. I'm patient, the board is patient and we’ve got plenty on our plate.""
Co-op Bank reported pretax profits of 28.5 million pounds for the nine months to September, compared to a 68.1 million pound loss over the same period last year.
The lender has started to reap the benefits of a period of painful restructuring, after its near-collapse and rescue by a group of U.S. hedge funds in 2017.

Slape said the bank was enjoying a ""turning point"" year, with growth in mortgage volumes amid a housebuying boom improving its returns.

1427,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 07:02AM ET</span>","Uber Slips on $2.4 Billion Loss, Weak Outlook","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Uber stock (NYSE:UBER) traded 1% weaker in Thursday’s premarket as the company booked a net loss of $2.4 billion in the third quarter and gave an outlook that analysts found underwhelming.
The loss was due overwhelmingly to writedowns on its equity investments, notably in Chinese ride-hailing Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI), whose stock fell heavily after a bruising battle with regulators in the summer. Uber also spent more to lure drivers back.
Though Uber didn’t name Didi in its report, it holds around 12% in Didi which listed on the NYSE on June 30. Since then, Didi’s shares have lost more than 41%.  
The ride-hailing company also holds 7.8% in India’s food delivery app Zomato though those shares trade well above their IPO price.
The company gave a wide range while forecasting its December-quarter adjusted earnings, saying it sees them between $25 million and $75 million. Analysts expected more,  given that the pandemic-related driver shortage is easing (thanks in part to its incentives), allowing the company to cash in better on a market where public confidence has rebounded to a level that encourages more cab use, both in absolute terms and relative to public mass transit systems.
Uber did manage to report an adjusted profit for the first time since listing, albeit it was a modest $8 million.
That compares to adjusted EBITDA of $67.3 million at  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT). Uber’s smaller rival expects adjusted EBITDA of $72.5 million at the midpoint of its fourth-quarter guidance range.
Uber’s gross bookings grew 57% on the year to $23.1 billion and revenue grew 72% to $4.8 billion.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, ahead of the release of the key monthly employment report which could influence the Federal Reserve’s thinking over the future path of interest rates.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 39 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.2%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 37 points, or 0.2%.
The three major indices are all on course for a winning week, buoyed by solid corporate earnings. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.9% on the week, while the broad-based S&P 500 is 1.6% higher and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 2.9%.
Also helping the tone this week was Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stating the need for the central bank to show patience before raising interest rates, even after announcing a start to reducing its bond purchases.
Powell said the bank's policymakers were looking for more improvement in the labor market, adding that this summer's wave of infections from the delta Covid variant disrupted what had been a robust pace of recovery.
That provides the backdrop for the official jobs report for October, a couple of days after a strong private payroll report and a day after new jobless claims dropped to post-pandemic lows.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls are forecast by economists to show a 450,000 surge in jobs in October, following a 194,000 rise in the prior month, but variables such as earnings growth and labor force participation will also be studied carefully.
In the corporate sector, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock slumped over 30% premarket after the exercise equipment maker lowered its annual guidance by as much as $1 billion, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock surged almost 9% as the drugmaker reported strong results for its Covid-19 pill, administered in conjunction with a widely-used HIV drug. 
Uber (NYSE:UBER) will also be in the spotlight after the ride-hailing firm reported its first profitable quarter on an adjusted basis since it launched more than a decade ago, but suffered a massive drop in the value of its stake in Chinese peer Didi resulting in a $2.4 billion net loss in the third quarter.
Crude prices strengthened Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies confirmed a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day at a meeting on Thursday, rebuffing calls from the likes of U.S. President Joe Biden for a more substantial increase in output.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $79.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $80.90.
Still, Brent is on track for a decline of nearly 4% this week, the second straight weekly drop. U.S. oil is heading for a decline this week of nearly 5%.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,795.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1551.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 06:57AM ET</span>",South Korean chip firms to omit detailed data in response to U.S. request -sources,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix plan to leave out detailed information when supplying Washington with data related to the global chip shortage as they want to protect trade secrets, two sources briefed on the matter said.
The South Korean firms - the world's two biggest makers of memory chips - are among companies the U.S. government has asked to volunteer information so it can better understand the crisis that has led to a sharp curtailing of auto production. It has set a Nov. 8 deadline for submission of the information.
The Commerce Department has said, however, it may make answers compulsory depending on the number and quality of responses.
""The scope of the U.S. data request is such that if all the information it wants is leaked, it would undermine competition and make it really easy for a client to choose one chipmaker over another,"" said one of the sources, who was not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified.
The issue has raised such concern in South Korea that Industry Minister Moon Sung-wook will discuss it with Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo when they meet on his trip to Washington next week.
The request is comprised of 26 topics seeking data on inventories, orders and sales ranging from ""everyday"" information to questions on highly strategic areas such as capacity increase plans, the top three customers for each product and how much those three customers account for in terms of the product's sales, according to an industry ministry source.
A Commerce Department spokesperson told Reuters last month that SK Hynix has indicated it plans to be very forthcoming with data. 
Both Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix have previously said they are reviewing the matter internally and did not have further comment on Friday.
Unlike made-to-order chip manufacturers, memory chipmakers stand to lose much more in terms of competitive advantages if information relating to inventories and pricing is leaked as ""one design is used in a lot of devices"", said one source.
The global chip shortage is predominantly one of made-to-order chips and there is sufficient supply of memory chips. Memory chips account for almost all of SK Hynix's semiconductor output. Samsung is the world's No. 2 contract chip manufacturer although it gains nearly all its chip earnings from memory chips.
Kim Young-woo, an analyst at SK Securities which is not affiliated with SK Hynix, said the South Korean firms were unlikely to disclose client information. 
""Giving Chinese customer information to the U.S. raises concerns of geopolitical risks,"" he added.
Public records show that 13 entities have already submitted data to the Commerce Department including Taiwan's ASE Technology Holding and a unit of Israel's  Tower Semiconductor  (NASDAQ:TSEM). 

ASE left most columns blank and attached a data sheet that was not accessible to the public, while Tower Semiconductor did not mention client names, only describing customer industries.
Taiwan's TSMC has said will not leak any sensitive company information in its response to the U.S. request.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 06:47AM ET</span>",Factbox-What are China's wealth management products?,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's property sector woes have shed light on a unique off-balance-sheet funding source used by the industry called wealth management products (WMPs) and often sold to retail investors.
This week, property developer Kaisa Group Holdings said its finance unit had missed a payment on a WMP. Missed WMP payments by cash-strapped developer China Evergrande Group have spurred investor protests.
Here's what you need to know about China's wealth management products:
WHAT ARE THEY?
WMPs are investment vehicles marketed by issuers including banks and property developers to retail and corporate investors, often paying yields that are far higher than deposits.
Those issued by banks are usually categorised as fixed-income products, with investment portfolios that include bonds, equities, futures and other sectors. 
WHAT ARE THE YIELDS?
They vary. China Merchants Bank, one of the country's biggest lenders, offers wealth management products with an estimated yield ranging from 2.95% to 6%, according to its app. Regional lender Ningbo Bank offers WMPs with estimated yields as high as 9.5%.
Evergrande, by comparison, sold products promising annual returns of nearly 12%. Those products were issued in the name of Evergrande suppliers but guaranteed by Evergrande if the issuers failed to repay.
While the annualized returns of such products are usually higher than deposit rates, regulators have been moving to ban banks from luring investors with guaranteed yields. 
HOW ARE THEY REGULATED? 
The banking regulator started to order banks to fully disclose all information related to their wealth management products from 2013, a decade after China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank issued the country's first bank wealth management product. 
Regulators also published sweeping new rules on asset management in 2018 to further rein in bank wealth management products, with bans on yield guarantees and a requirement that banks set up standalone wealth management units.
The WMPs sold by companies such as Evergrande, however, are off the radar of banking and insurance regulators, and are registered in loosely regulated local financial asset exchanges. 
In September, the Shenzhen city government said it launched a thorough investigation into ""issues related"" to Evergrande Wealth. 
WHO ARE THE ISSUERS?
Wealth management units set up by Chinese banks are the major issuers of WMPs, typically raising funds from banking customers. 
By the end of September, there was an outstanding 27.95 trillion yuan ($4.37 trillion) in China's bank wealth management market, with nearly 71 million individual investors holding such products, according to Chinawealth.com.cn, an official website tracking the industry. 
However, China's years-long effort to deleverage its economy has also pushed companies, including property firms, to resort to off-balance sheet vehicles in search of funding, which are sometimes packaged as wealth management products to lure retail investors. 
HOW BIG IS THE MARKET FOR CORPORATE WMPS?
There is no official data on the size of the market.
Evergrande Wealth, a unit launched by Evergrande in 2016 as a peer-to-peer online lending platform that originally was used to fund its property projects, sold WMPs products to more than 80,000 people – including employees, their families and friends as well as owners of Evergrande properties - and raised more than 100 billion yuan in the past five years, a sales manager there told Reuters. [L4N2QM1U0]
WHY ARE THEY POPULAR?
China's economic growth has created a large investor class. Some 96% of urban Chinese households own property and more than 2 million people have at least $1.5 million to invest, according to HSBC.

However, capital controls, limited onshore investment options and low deposit yields have long sent Chinese seeking higher returns in WMPs.

ABUJA (Reuters) - MTN Group Ltd will begin book-building this month for a public offer to sell up to 575 million shares in its Nigeria business, South Africa's biggest telecoms operator said on Thursday, as it reported higher third-quarter revenue and core profit.
The company, which has been exiting or reducing its stakes in some areas including its Ugandan and Zambian units, said the separation of fintech and fibre assets was on track.
MTN, which along with Vodacom Group Ltd controls more than 70% of the South African mobile market in terms of subscribers, said this month's bookbuilding exercise would target institutional investors before a fixed price was announced for retail investors. 
""In South Africa, rising unemployment is a concern and may impact growth from prepaid customers in the lower-income segment in the near-term, if measures such as the temporary employee relief scheme are withdrawn,"" the company said.
MTN listed its Nigerian business in Lagos two years ago to become the second-largest stock by market capitalisation.
Shares of MTN Nigeria, which traded flat on Thursday at 191 naira, fell to the listing price of 90 naira in March 2020, hammered by lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus.

MTN's core profit jumped 24.1% in the three months to September on robust demand for data and digital financial services. It added 0.2 million subscribers during the quarter, taking the total to 271.9 million.
The company, which extended its chief operating officer Jens Schulte-Bockum's contract by two years to 2024, said it was targeting 2021 capital expenditure of 31.1 billion rand, up from a prior outlook of 14.8 billion rand.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Proposed new climate disclosure rules for companies announced this week will only work if they are adopted in Asia, Ashley Alder, the CEO of Hong Kong's markets watchdog and chair of the umbrella body for global securities regulators said on Friday. 
A newly created organisation, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), was unveiled at the U.N.'s COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow this week hoping to build on and replace a patchwork of voluntary disclosure practices that have had mixed success. 
The ISSB aims to create global disclosure standards to prevent companies giving a flattering picture of their climate policies and business practices to investors looking for environmentally sustainable companies. 
""These standards for everybody, including in the West, are massively dependent on the way in which they are picked up in Asia, which is the largest concentration of global emissions,"" Alder told a media briefing, adding they also needed to be picked up across developing markets more broadly.
""I don't actually think there is going to be a problem when it comes to the global roll out,"" said Alder, who is chair of IOSCO, which helped set up the ISSB, as well as Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commision (SFC), but ""it's a point that we continually need to push."" 
""When you're in Europe you feel that there's a sort of Western-centric atmosphere notwithstanding the fact that the key to solving climate does not sit wholly in the West."" 
Either as a result of regulation or of their own volition, many banks and asset managers around the world are looking to direct investment away from heavily emitting companies and towards those that are more climate friendly or working to become so. 
However, the absence of clear widely agreed standards of comparable data makes this difficult. 

The ISSB will publish its first batch of global norms for climate-related company disclosures next year, though its success depends on whether major countries apply and enforce the their proposals. 
Alder said in Hong Kong the SFC anticipated working with the stock exchange to incorporate the new standards into Hong Kong's listing rules and would talk to the government about possibly legislating in order to extend their reach to private companies.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canadian banks and insurers can resume dividend increases and share buybacks and raise executive compensation, the country's financial regulator said on Thursday, lifting a moratorium it imposed in March 2020 and possibly paving the way for a boost to the sector's valuation. 
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) said in a statement that the measures had been effective over the past year and a half but are no longer necessary.
Canada's six biggest lenders - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - had almost C$49 billion ($39.4 billion) in capital in excess of the current minimum requirement in the quarter ended July 31. 
""When you have lazy equity, surplus capital, that suppresses return on equity and depresses the valuation,"" said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel.
Madden added that he expects the banks to announce changes to their capital distributions when they report fourth-quarter results in early December. 
""This (move) creates an impetus for valuation multiples to expand,"" Madden said.
The Canadian banks index has risen 82% during the 20 months with the moratorium in place. The U.S. banks benchmark has jumped 107% during the same time.
Canadian banks' attractive dividends yields are a big draw for investors. But they grew increasingly impatient as regulators in other parts of the world, including the United States, Europe and Australia, lifted their curbs. 
Most of the banks' dividend payout ratios had slipped in the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 from the same period of fiscal 2019, to the high 30s, compared with their target ranges of 40-50%. They are expected to fall below their three- and five-year averages for 2021, according to analysis by Canaccord Genuity. 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Peter Routledge defended the delay in a media call on Thursday, saying the regulator felt ""a little caution, a little bit more prudence for a few more months wouldn't hurt the system,"" particularly as COVID-19 cases rose into the summer.
In June, OSFI said it would raise the minimum capital buffer to guard against risks to a record high starting on Oct. 31, a reversal of one of the pandemic-era measures to support financial institutions and boost lending. 
National Bank and BMO could increase dividends by the most to reach the mid-point of their targeted ranges, by 38% and 33% respectively, the analysis, based on fiscal 2022, showed.

Life insurer Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF) could lift dividends by 33% and Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) by 9%, Canaccord said.

""Today's announcement is prudent given pandemic-related risks have been reduced, Visano said.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",What's driving the latest Volkswagen power struggle?,"By Christoph Steitz and Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess' frail relationship with German labour representatives hit a new low this week with disagreement over how radical the overhaul at Europe's top carmaker must be in its quest for electric vehicle dominance. 
While both sides tried to demonstrate unity at a staff meeting on Thursday, the first at Volkswagen's giant Wolfsburg plant in nearly two years, there is no guarantee the dispute can be fixed quickly, if it can be fixed at all.
In fact, Volkswagen's four-member mediation committee is planning to discuss Diess' future soon, sources have said, creating uncertainty around the carmaker's leadership less than four months after the CEO's contract was extended.
IS DIESS STILL THE MAN FOR THE JOB?
Daniel Schwarz, analyst at Stifel, thinks so.
""His consistent EV (electric vehicle) strategy makes sense. He has a stronger focus on capital markets than his predecessors, which is benefiting the Volkswagen share,"" he said.
While Volkswagen's preferred shares have gained just 6% since Diess took over as CEO in April 2018, its common stock - more than half of which is owned by top shareholder Porsche SE - is up 68%.
Diess, whose contract was extended until 2025 in July, is currently hammering out the company's next investment plan to 2030, a process that usually causes friction among stakeholders each year.
Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst is more sceptical.
""Diess stands for the radical change the company must go through after the dieselgate emissions scandal. What he does not yet stand for is implementation.""
Porsche AG boss Oliver Blume, Audi CEO Markus Duesmann as well as Volkswagen brand CEO Ralf Brandstaetter have all been named as potential successors in the event that Diess gets the boot or decides to leave the multi-brand group.
""You need someone in Wolfsburg who understands the company and who is prepared to engage with the works council. I don't know if Oliver Blume is the right person,"" Ellinghorst said. ""Ralf Brandstaetter could possibly be better at that.""
WHY ALL THE FUSS?
Volkswagen, the world's second largest carmaker after Toyota, is under pressure to adapt to huge industry shifts, most notably the rise of EVs and self-driving cars.
Both areas are outside the comfort zone of German carmakers, including Volkswagen, who have long dominated the age of internal combustion engines.
Enter new rivals, particularly Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which have started with a clean sheet of paper and revolutionised production and supply chains.
""In the world of combustion engines we are leading. We're good at that, maybe better than everyone else,"" Diess told workers on Thursday. ""But in the new world ... we are facing competition Volkswagen has never seen before.""
WHAT'S ITCHING THE WORKS COUNCIL?
Diess.
The 63-year old has been repeatedly criticised for his communication style that labour representatives say displays a lack of interest in the concerns of 675,000 employees around the world.
Diess, in particular, drew the ire of workers when he told Volkswagen's supervisory board in September that roughly 30,000 jobs were at risk if the company was too slow in its EV transition, sources have said.
The same goes for some of Diess' social media activities, including a video of him thanking staff for record first-half results while surfing on the canal next to the Wolfsburg headquarters.
""The way you have presented yourself in recent months I do wonder whether you're actually aware of the situation at our site here and how this is being perceived by the workforce,"" works council head Daniela Cavallo said on Thursday.
WHAT'S ITCHING HERBERT DIESS?
Tesla.
The U.S.-based carmaker has shown it's not just the number of cars you make, but technology and software that determine success in the new auto world.
Tesla, which sold 627,350 vehicles in the first nine months of 2021, is worth $1.2 trillion, more than eight times Volkswagen's 124 billion euros ($143 billion) market valuation, even though the German group sold eleven times as many cars in the period.
Tesla is also producing more quickly and efficiently, with Diess expecting the U.S. company will require just 10 hours to assemble each vehicle at its planned Gruenheide plant near Berlin, expected to open later this year.
""In (our plant in) Zwickau we're at more than 30 hours, we hope to achieve 20 hours next year - our original project target was 16 hours,"" Diess said.
WHO HAS THE POWER?
At 31.4%, Porsche SE, which is 50%-owned by the Porsche and Piech families, is Volkswagen's largest shareholder, while Qatar and the state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, own 14.6% and 11.8%, respectively.
Between them they hold more than 90% of the voting rights, but on Volkswagen's supervisory board - which approves key strategic decisions - labour representatives hold half of the 20 seats as part of Germany's co-determination principle.

In the rare event of a stalemate on the board, the chairman - in this case Porsche SE CEO Hans Dieter Poetsch - holds sway.

Investing.com – Peloton stock (NASDAQ:PTON) plunged 33% in Friday’s premarket trading as a pandemic-era boom for home fitness weakened rapidly. 
The company lowered its annual guidance by as much as $1 billion, saying it had underestimated the speed at which people would return to pre-Covid habits.  
The company now expects annual sales of no more than $4.8 billion and as little as $4.4 billion, which would be a neat billion dollar less than the projection it gave less than three months back.
There were other headwinds too, arguably some of its own doing, as its attempts to tap the mass market fell flat. The company cut the prices of its flagship exercise Bike during the period to lure a younger audience but struggled to overcome the image it had previously cultivated of being a maker of high-end items.
The costs of promoting more affordable Bikes and treadmills more than doubled, meanwhile, eating into profitability.
Sales and marketing expense was $284 million, representing around 35% of total revenue, up from just over 15% a year earlier. Revenue by contrast rose only 6% to $805.2 million, driven by 94% growth in subscription revenue. Fewer deliveries of Bikes hurt and so did charges related to safety-related recalls of Tread and Tread+ products.
Adjusted profit per share was $1.25. As with sales, that too disappointed analysts.  
In the ongoing quarter, Peloton expects $1.15 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range..

Salaries and working hours remain uneven between western and eastern Germany, with government data showing eastern German workers continue to work slightly longer hours for less money than their western counterparts.
BMW committed on Friday to reducing the working week at its plant in Leipzig, part of former Communist East Germany, in three stages to 35 hours by 2026, and bringing on 300 additional employees to make up the shortfall. 
""More than 30 years after the fall of the wall, our BMW Group workers finally do not have to work three more hours than their colleagues in the west,"" works council head Manfred Schoch said.

Rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) made a similar move in May, implementing a 35-hour working week at its east German plants to match west German working hours.
However, it did not hire additional workers, instead expecting east German plants to boost productivity.

(Reuters) -Spanish travel booking group Amadeus returned to profit in the third quarter after more than a year of quarterly losses, it said on Friday, citing a pick-up in flight bookings after pandemic-related travel restrictions eased.
The company made adjusted net profit of 23.8 million euros ($27.51 million) in the third quarter compared with a 125 million euro loss in the same period a year ago. Its free cash flow turned positive, with an inflow of about 84 million euros.
However, the net profit was below analysts' average forecast of 38.8 million euros, according to Refintiv, and Amadeus shares were down 2.7% in early trade.
Amadeus's slide into the red in the second quarter of 2020 was its first quarterly loss in a decade as the pandemic grounded airliners around the world.
The company, which operates the world's largest travel booking system and offers check-in services and other IT solutions for airports and airlines, is almost fully dependent on international air traffic.
It said it continued to see an uptick in the number of travelling passengers, as air bookings jumped more than four times in the third quarter from the same period a year ago.
The number of reservations made through Amadeus's distribution platforms, however, was still 59% below 2019 levels.
""Looking at the rest of the year, we are confident that our commercial momentum, along with the upward trend in travel volumes, will allow us to maintain this positive progression towards recovery,"" Chief Executive Luis Maroto said.
Domestic travel is expected to recover to 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2022, a 20 percentage points improvement from this year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in October.

The industry body expects international travel demand to double next year and reach 44% of the 2019 levels.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Roche's family owners have been saved from having to make an expensive offer for the rest of the pharmaceuticals giant's shares after its $20.7 billion deal to buy back Novartis's stake took them over a voting threshold.
Novartis said on Thursday it would sell its nearly one-third voting stake in Roche back to its cross-town rival, disentangling the two drug companies that had been linked by the investment for two decades.
The deal, which would see the purchased shares cancelled, would raise the stake of the pool of Roche family members from 45.01% at present to 67.5%.
Under Swiss rules, anyone who already owns more than a third of a Swiss company and then raises their stake to more than 50% must make an offer for all the listed shares.
But the family, descendents of company founder Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, requested an exemption from having to launch an offer to other shareholders, which could have potentially cost them billions of francs.
The Swiss Takeover Board said on Friday it had approved the exemption, saying there was no indication the family had tried to get around the rules and was not actively seeking further its control over Roche.
""The pool of shareholders neither initiated nor negotiated the transaction,"" the board said.
""It also had no influence on the decision-making process of the Roche board of directors. In this respect, the threshold of 50% of voting rights in Roche is involuntarily exceeded by the shareholder pool.""
With a market capitalisation of nearly 328 billion Swiss francs ($359.22 billion), buying the remaining 32.5% in Roche could cost the family pool up to 107 billion francs if all the other shareholders tendered their stock. 

Roche said when the deal was announced on Thursday that it will use debt to finance what it called a ""disentanglement of two competitors"" and plans to reduce its capital by cancelling the repurchased shares to regain full strategic flexibility.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers could face European climate stress tests as soon as 2023, the head of the EU's insurance regulator said at the Reuters Future of Insurance Europe conference on Thursday.
The insurance industry faces exposure to climate change risk both through its underwriting of fossil fuels and through the investment portfolios of individual insurers.
Petra Hielkema, chairperson of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), said although the tests will take place by 2024 at the latest ""it might be we want to do this one quicker"".
But Hielkema, who was speaking on a panel on climate change, said there was ""no concrete planning"" for 2023 tests yet.
Hielkema said stress tests for pension funds next year were also likely to focus on climate change.
Anna Sweeney, the Bank of England's executive director for insurance, said the central bank was in the process of conducting its first climate stress tests for banks and insurers, with results due in the first quarter of 2022.
""We've had to ask for resubmissions from some firms where we have felt that there hasn't been enough due diligence...or enough clarity,"" she told the panel. 
To view video, click: https://vimeo.com/642406430/6267b6e568 
Hielkema and Sweeney both said their tests would not be focused on capital requirements. Hielkema said the use of a carbon tax was a better way to encourage companies to tackle climate change risk than imposing capital requirements.
Alison Martin, EMEA CEO for Zurich Insurance, also told the panel that a carbon price was needed ""as part of a suite of mechanisms to help us get to the transition"". 
""We have nearly 70 different versions of carbon price mechanisms...there's a challenge to get to something which is harmonised,"" Martin said.
Delegates at the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow are wrangling over the rules around Article 6, the section of the U.N. Convention on Climate Change that deals with markets for trading carbon emissions that continue to be emitted. 
One of the toughest tasks will be in synchronizing global rules around these markets, as well as in agreeing on a global price for carbon.

Marie Niemczyk, head of insurance relations at investment firm Candriam, told the panel that a carbon price would be a very useful tool in investing, but ""it needs to be high enough to actually have a deterrent effect"".

Cases increased by 37,120 on Thursday, while the seven-day incidence rate climbed to 169.9, exceeding the peak reached during the third wave in the spring, according to the latest data from the RKI public-health institute.
“All alarm signals are showing red,” Michael Kretschmer -- the premier of the eastern state of Saxony, which has one of Germany’s most severe outbreaks -- said Friday. “Urgent action is needed.” 
The surge prompted Chancellor Angela Merkel to express deep concern about the course of the pandemic heading into the winter. It also threatens to interfere with coalition talks led by Olaf Scholz to form a new government after his Social Democratic Party won September’s national election.
Germany’s spike is indicative of issues across Europe, where infections are surging as restrictions ease and colder weather forces people indoors. The spread comes despite broad access to vaccinations and should be a warning shot for the world, a World Health Organization official said Thursday.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn will conclude a two-day meeting with counterparts from the country’s 16 states later on Friday, when they are expected to agree on offering Covid-19 vaccine boosters to almost everyone who wants one.
The country’s immunization drive has stalled in recent months, with just under 67% of the population fully vaccinated. Some 16 million Germans who are eligible for a Covid shot have opted not to get one, and 3 million of those are at least 60 years old, Spahn said this week.
The infection rate in Saxony is ten times higher among non-vaccinated people, according to Kretchmer. He warned that restrictions may need to be reimposed if trends continue.
“If we don’t act swiftly, we’ll end up in a lockdown like last year,” Kretschmer said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio. “It’s about preventing that to protect children, families and the economy.”

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early Friday, with investors studying corporate earnings and the week’s central bank policy decisions ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.4% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, breaching the 7,000 points barrier for the first time ever.
The Bank of England surprised investors on Thursday by keeping its interest rate steady, the day after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated that it would be “patient” on interest rate hikes while beginning asset tapering.
Earlier in the week European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back against market bets for a rate hike, stating it was very unlikely such a move would occur in 2022.
Central bankers are proceeding cautiously with the normalization of monetary policy, allowing their economies as much time as possible to recover from the ravages of the pandemic.
Weighing on the German stock market was a surprise drop in the country’s industrial production of 1.1% in September, as supply bottlenecks for raw and preliminary materials continued to take a toll on output in Europe's biggest economy. French production also fell the most since February, and Spanish output growth fell to its lowest in the same timeframe.
In corporate news, IAG (LON:ICAG) stock fell 3.4% after the parent company of British Airways said it was heading for a 3 billion euro ($3.5 billion) loss for 2021, illustrating the impact of the pandemic on international travel. Its prediction of a recovery next year didn't help noticeably.
 Amadeus  (MC:AMA) stock fell 1.3% despite the Spanish travel booking group returning to profitability in the third quarter after more than a year of consecutive quarterly losses as flight bookings picked up.
Uniper (DE:UN01) stock rose 0.3%, reaching an all-time high, after the German energy company reported a 52% in nine-month adjusted profit, helped by volatile gas prices. 
Elsewhere, German retail investor darling  Varta  (DE:VAR1) fell 20% to its lowest in over a year after cutting its 2021 sales forecast due to supply chain problems at the battery maker's customers.
Later in the session the focus will turn to the release of the U.S. official monthly jobs report, where variables such as earnings growth and labor force participation will arguably be as important as the headline job creation number. 
Economists expected payrolls to rise by 450,000 in October, a considerable improvement from the 194,000 rise in the prior month, which was the lowest in eight months.
Crude prices strengthened Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies confirmed a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day at a meeting on Thursday, rebuffing calls from the likes of U.S. President Joe Biden for a more substantial increase in output.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $79.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $81.06.
Still, Brent is on track for a decline of nearly 4% this week, the second straight weekly drop. U.S. oil is heading for a decline this week of nearly 5%.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,799.65/oz, while EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1555.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog said it was examining the regulatory implications of Commonwealth Bank's's planned introduction of bitcoin trading to unsophisticated retail investors - the first bank in Australia to do so.
CBA says it would welcome a clear regulatory framework for crytpocurrencies, which are not formally regulated in Australia.
On Wednesday CBA broke banking industry ranks to match offerings from fintech firms by announcing it will become the first main-street bank in the developed world to offer a platform for retail customers to trade cryptocurrencies.
The move is forcing financial watchdogs in Australia to immediately focus on the volatile $2 trillion crypto trading industry that many argue has no intrinsic value and relies on users' complete trust in different types of software.
A spokesman for the Australian Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (APRA) told Reuters the country's largest lender had made the regulator aware of its plans and the authority was ""examining regulatory issues that this raises"".
After a staged pilot for 2,000 people, CBA will give easy access to crypto trading in 10 assets to about a third of Australian adults already using its industry-leading mobile banking app, which also offers energy retailers discounts and carbon emission trackers.
CBA's crypto trading service will be provided in partnership with Gemini Trust Company, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges that was created in 2014 by the Winklevoss brothers, famous for accusing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s founder of stealing their idea.
The anti-money laundering watchdog the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre said that it was ""engaging ... in relation to this new product offering"" with both CBA and Gemini. 
CBA says it would welcome regulatory clarity in the space, and that its product was designed with risk-mitigation and regulatory concerns front of mind for both the bank and to ensure people feel safe when using the product.
""We would really welcome regulatory clarity for crypto assets. We think it would improve the market, enhance trust and it would raise the bar in terms of customer protection,"" said Sophie Gilder, Commonwealth Bank's head of Blockchain and the bank's project leader.
CBA's offering will be a ""a closed loop"" connected to a CBA bank account, that would be monitored with cryptocurrency anti-money laundering services from Chainalysis for any potential suspicious activity. 

""We've got complete transparency as to customer activity and can report on that to regulators when necessary,"" Gilder said, which includes customary reporting to the taxation authority. 
""We will not, as soon as the pilot ends, open it to everyone. It will be a more gradual process than that, which I think is appropriate considering the volatility of crypto.""

A week that started with expectations of hawkish central banks, flattening bond yield curves and an equity correction is heading for a calmer end after Fed assurances that rate hikes were not yet on its mind and the Bank of England stunned markets by keeping policy steady.
Bond curves are mostly steeper as rate hike expectations retreat -- the two-year Treasury yield has tumbled more than 10 basis points off 19-month peaks of 0.5640% touched last week.
Britain's two-year gilt yield fell almost 21 bps after Thursday's UK rate decision -- its biggest one-day fall since the day after the 2016 Brexit referendum
And with ""real"" or inflation-adjusted yields resuming their fall, global equities appear headed towards the $100-trillion market cap mark.
The odd central bank-fuelled hiccup will be thrown in, doubtless, and don't forget China's property malaise -- shares in homebuilder Kaisa were suspended after an affiliate missed a payment, pulling Chinese bourses lower and knocking European and U.S. futures.
Economic data meanwhile continues to underwhelm, with Germany's industrial output down sharply in September, hit by supply bottlenecks. Japan's household spending fell in September in a sign the economy shrank in the third quarter.
Watch now for euro area retail sales and U.S. monthly payrolls data, which a Reuters poll forecasts will show 450,000 jobs added last month. Last month's report was a dismal one remember, so stock market bulls will be watching.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - The Spanish regional government of Catalonia has offered Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s SEAT the choice of at least two possible sites for a big battery plant the carmaker plans to build in Spain, two sources told Reuters. 
Neighbouring Aragon has also proposed a possible site for the plant, one of the sources said, as several Spanish regions compete for a slice of 4.3 billion euros ($4.96 billion) earmarked by the Spanish central government to promote electric vehicle production and build the country's first battery plant for cars. The funds will mostly come from EU pandemic relief funds.
A Volkswagen spokesperson said the process to select a site is currently underway and has not been completed, noting that the ""technological, logistical and economic requirements for the localization of a battery cell factory are very high"".
Spain is Europe's second-largest carmaker, after Germany.
SEAT's main car factory is near Catalonia's regional capital Barcelona, where it has said it could start manufacturing electric vehicles (EV) in 2025. 
The Barcelona-area also hosts Nissan (OTC:NSANY) plants but they are scheduled to close in December, while Stellantis has manufacturing operations in Aragon. 
Volkswagen wants to build six European battery factories by the end of the decade. It said in July it would make its ""best efforts"" to build one in Spain but has said that would depend on support from the government in Madrid and access to public funds. 
The Catalan government has offered SEAT a large tract of publicly-owned land around the city of Lleida, the two sources said. One said the government had also offered land in the coastal city of Tarragona. Both sites are well connected by road and train, and cheaper than privately-owned land. 
SEAT has also been offered a site in the Huesca area, in the Aragon region, one source said.
Any of these potential locations would be along transport routes connecting SEAT's Barcelona plant with VW's car plant in the Navarra region, which would be useful if both factories eventually need batteries to produce EVs. 
""We are working to attract new investments seeking to re-industrialize (the region) with future added-value projects,"" Catalonia's government industry director Natalia Mas said in an emailed statement. 
An Aragon government source said the region has told Spain's industry minister about its capacity to host a battery plant.

SEAT, which has remained silent on possible locations for the battery plant, declined to comment.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's High Court on Friday refused to hear an appeal that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) sought to overturn a federal court ruling that its subsidiary, Ethicon, had sold defective pelvic mesh implants, a court spokesman said.
J&J and Shine Lawyers, which led the class action, said the matter would now go back to the Federal Court to set up a process to determine payments to the more than 11,000 claimants in Australia's biggest product liability class action.
""Ethicon is disappointed that it has not been successful in its application for special leave to appeal,"" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement.
The three lead members of the class action, Kathryn Gill, Diane Dawson and Ann Sanders, will now be eligible to receive the A$1.276 million ($943,000), A$555,555 and A$757,372 they were awarded, respectively, Shine Lawyers said in a statement.
The claims of the remaining members of the class action would be assessed separately.
The pharmaceutical giant wanted to appeal a March ruling by the full bench of the Federal Court of Australia that upheld a November 2019 decision by a federal court judge.
That judge found that Ethicon had sold implants to treat urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse without warning women and surgeons about the risks and had rushed the products to market before proper testing.
Shine Lawyers filed a second class action against Ethicon and J&J in the Federal Court in April on behalf of women implanted with a defective mesh product from July 2017, to include women who were not eligible to join a first class action that was filed in 2012.
The allegations in the second class action are basically the same as those in the first. It will be up to the court to decide how that will proceed, Shine Lawyers spokesperson Miriam Sawan said.

J&J has faced similar lawsuits on its pelvic mesh products in the United States, Canada and Europe.

1457,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 03:03AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Nonfarm Payrolls Due,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Friday, ending the week on a cautious note as investors digest central bank policy decisions ahead of the release of key U.S. employment data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France were flat and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
The Bank of England surprised investors on Thursday by keeping its interest rate steady, the day after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated that it would be “patient” on interest rate hikes while beginning asset tapering.
Earlier in the week European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back against market bets for a rate hike, stating it was very unlikely such a move would occur in 2022.
Central bankers are proceeding cautiously with the normalization of monetary policy, allowing their economies as much time as possible to recover from the ravages of the pandemic.
Such caution may well be warranted, especially in Europe, given that coronavirus infections are hitting record levels in many countries across the region as winter takes hold.
""The current pace of transmission across the 53 countries of the European Region is of grave concern,"" regional World Health Organisation head Hans Kluge said Thursday, adding there could be 500,000 Covid-related deaths in the region by February.
In economic news, German industrial production fell 1.1% in September, disappointing hopes for a rebound from the previous month’s revised 3.5% drop. September retail sales are also due in the Eurozone, but the main release will be the U.S. nonfarm payrolls later in the session, where variables such as earnings growth and labor force participation will arguably be as important as the headline job creation number. 
Economists expected payrolls to rise by 450,000 in October, a considerable improvement from the 194,000 rise in the prior month, which was the lowest in eight months.
Crude prices strengthened Friday after OPEC+ decided to maintain their stance of gradually increasing supply at a meeting Thursday, rebuffing calls for a more substantial increase in output.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, confirmed a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day, not bowing to pressure from U.S. President Joe Biden, among others.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $79.64 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $81.05.
Still, Brent is on track for a decline of nearly 4% this week, the second straight weekly drop. U.S. oil is heading for a decline this week of nearly 5%.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,798.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1560.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) expects to report higher profit before allowances next year after Southeast Asia's largest bank beat estimates with a 31% rise in third quarter net profit, aided by growth in fee income and improving asset quality.
Friday's result rounded out a robust quarter for Singapore banks such as OCBC and United Overseas Bank (OTC:UOVEY), just as global lenders are rebounding in markets hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and amid improved economic activity.
""Loan growth for the three banks already saw some recovery, and benefits of lower credit costs are already in the bottom line,"" said Kevin Kwek, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ""Significant upside has to come from surprises on robustness of growth, and rates.""
Singapore, recovering from last year's record recession, is re-opening its borders with 85% of its population fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. The city-state's economy is expected to grow 6%–7% this year.
The performance of Singapore banks is being powered by a strong showing in their wealth management businesses, while they are also set to benefit from interest rates ticking up from record lows.
DBS reported net profit of S$1.7 billion ($1.26 billion) in July-September versus S$1.30 billion from a year earlier and the S$1.57 billion average forecast from four analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
""Our pipeline as we go forward into next year reflects that the momentum should continue,"" DBS CEO Piyush Gupta told reporters, adding that the bank is likely to post 6-7% loan growth next year versus 4-5% in a normal pre-pandemic year.
Shares of DBS, trading near record highs, rose 0.2% on Friday, having gained nearly 29% so far this year versus an 18% rise in OCBC and a 20% increase in UOB's shares.
""We were originally planning not to do salary hikes this year but the market situation and conditions compelled us to take salary actions in the middle of the year,"" Gupta said, highlighting higher costs.
DBS expects its asset quality to stay resilient and total allowances to remain low.
""As the revenue drivers further strengthen and if credit cost stays below normal, the group looks poised to deliver steady growth next year,"" Krishna Guha, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF),"" said in a report.
DBS wrote back credit allowances of S$70 million in the quarter, helping boost profits, compared with credit charges of S$554 million booked in the year-ago period.
Profit before allowances fell 7% to S$1.89 billion in the quarter. DBS' net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, dipped to 1.43% from 1.53% a year earlier.

This year, Gupta spearheaded DBS' purchase of a stake in a privately-owned Chinese bank, months after acquiring a distressed Indian lender. DBS has also forayed into new ventures, including a digital exchange, to boost revenue.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>","Chinese developers' shares, bonds stumble again as Kaisa, units suspended","HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A rout in shares and bonds of Chinese property developers deepened on Friday as Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd and three of its units had their shares suspended, a day after Kaisa said an affiliate had missed a payment on a wealth management product.
Shenzhen-based homebuilder Kaisa, which has guaranteed the wealth management product, said in a statement on Thursday it is facing unprecedented liquidity pressure due to a challenging property market and rating downgrades.
A Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed Kaisa's shares were suspended as of Friday. The exchange did not elaborate.
Kaisa's troubles come amid concerns about a broadening liquidity crisis in the Chinese property sector, with a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades and sell-offs in the developers' shares and bonds in recent weeks.
The Hong Kong-listed shares of Kaisa, which has a market value of about $1 billion, plunged more than 15% on Thursday to an all-time low. 
In early trade in Hong Kong, a sub-index tracking the mainland property sector fell more than 2%, deepening its losses in the past two weeks to nearly 20%. An index of real estate A-shares fell more than 1.6% against a 0.25% drop in the broader blue-chip index.
Shares of China Evergrande Group, once China's largest property developer and whose debt woes have sparked off a liquidity crisis across China's $5 trillion property sector, fell 1.7%. The company's 11.5% October 2022 bond fell more than 10% to yield above 300%, according to Duration Finance, leading sharp falls across developers' bonds.
An ETF tracking Asian high-yield dollar bonds slumped nearly 1.5% in early trade, while spreads on Chinese high-yield dollar debt hovered near record highs.

""Kaisa could likely be another Evergrande,"" said Raymond Cheng, head of China research at CGS-CIMB Securities, adding that the companies woes had intensified market concerns over developers' liquidity conditions. 
""Even though the regulators have some easing measures ... it seems that may not be able to help that much,"" he said. ""Unless the government has aggressive loosening measures ... we expect to see more and more developers have problems (paying) off their debts.""Kaisa has the most offshore debt coming due over the next year of any Chinese developer after embattled China Evergrande Group, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities.

Investing.com –  Clover Biopharmaceuticals  Ltd. (HK:2197) made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday, raising HK$2.03 billion ($260.17 million) in the process.
Shares were steady at HK$13 ($1.67) as of 12:25 AM ET (4:25 AM GMT), after trading as high as HK$13.56 earlier in the session.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) (Asia) LLC, China International Capital Corporation Hong Kong Securities Limited, and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) (Hong Kong) Limited participated as joint global coordinators.
The COVID-19 vaccine developer priced the 150 million shares on offer at HK$13.38, the upper part of its HK$12.80 to HK$13.50 price guidance range. There is also an over-allocation of 22,500,000 Offer shares in the international offering.
Based on the offer price, the net proceeds from the listing, after deducting underwriting fees and other expenses, are estimated to be roughly HK$1.87 billion, or $240.26 million, according to the company. The bulk of the proceeds will be used in the research, production, and commercialization of its core products.
The company’s core product includes S-Trimer (SCB-2019), its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate. A large global clinical trial showed that S-Trimer was 67% effective against COVID-19 of any degree of severity, and 79% against the Delta variant, the company said in September.
Clover has also inked a deal to supply up to 414 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine through the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX.
“We are excited at what the future holds as we submit conditional regulatory approval applications for and potentially commercialize S-Trimer in the near term,” Joshua Liang, CEO and executive director at Clover, said in a statement."

(Reuters) -Vaccine developer  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc said on Thursday it has completed the submission process for emergency use listing of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate with the World Health Organization.
The company submitted to the health agency all modules required for the evaluation of NVX-CoV2373, its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, days after receiving its first emergency use authorization from Indonesia.
""The first authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine... will fill a vital need for Indonesia, which is the fourth most populous nation on earth and continues to work to procure sufficient vaccine for its population,"" Chief Executive Stanley Erck said during an investor call. 
The company is also expecting regulators in countries including India and the Philippines to decide on its vaccine within weeks.
A green light from the WHO would set the stage for Novavax to begin shipping doses to the COVAX program that supplies shots to low-income countries.
Novavax is prepared to deliver its vaccine globally, Erck said in a statement. Novavax's partner, Serum Institute in India, has already manufactured ""tens of millions"" of doses that are ready for shipment, Erck added during the call. 
The company said it remains on track to file for U.S. approval by end of the year. 
It also expects to provide booster doses to high- and low-income countries around the world and to be prepared to submit for regulatory authorization of its shots for children in the first quarter of 2021, Erck said. 
""We expect the need for boosters will continue in the coming years,"" he said. ""Over the coming months, we will be able to support supply to additional markets in need of boosters.""

The Maryland-based vaccine developer reported a bigger net loss of $322.4 million, or $4.31 per share, for the third quarter, compared with $197.3 million a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $178.8 million, mainly due to increased development activities relating to its COVID vaccine, including services performed under the U.S. government agreement and royalties from licensing pacts.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 12:27AM ET</span>",Britain approves Merck's COVID-19 pill in world first,"By Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -Britain on Thursday became the first country in the world to approve a potentially game-changing COVID-19 antiviral pill jointly developed by U.S.-based Merck & Co Inc and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, in a boost to the fight against the pandemic.
Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-oral-antiviral-for-covid-19-lagevrio-molnupiravir-approved-by-mhra the drug, molnupiravir, for use in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity, older age diabetes, and heart disease. 
It will be administered as soon as possible following a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms, the regulator said, citing clinical data.
The green light is the first for an oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and the first for a COVID-19 drug that will be administered widely in the community. U.S. advisers will meet on Nov. 30 to review the drug's safety and efficacy data and vote on whether molnupiravir should be authorized.
The pill, which will be branded as Lagevrio in Britain, is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and is taken twice a day for five days.
Drugs in the same class as molnupiravir have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has said animal testing shows that molnupiravir is safe, but the data have not yet been made public.
Treatments to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than 5.2 million people worldwide, have so far focused mainly on vaccines. Other options, including Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, are generally only given after a patient has been hospitalised.
Merck's Molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19 when given early in the illness. 
Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said the drug would be administered to patients at higher risk of complications as Britain heads into one of the most challenging winters ever.
A wider rollout will follow if it is clinically and cost effective in reducing hospitalisations and death, he added.
""We are now working across government and the NHS to urgently get this treatment to patients initially through a national study so we can collect more data on how antivirals work in a mostly vaccinated population,"" UK vaccines minister Maggie Throup told parliament.
PRESSURES
The speedy approval in Britain, which was also the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, comes as it struggles to tame soaring infections. 
Britain has about 40,000 daily cases of COVID-19, according to the latest seven-day average. That is second only to the roughly 74,000 a day in the United States, which has five times more people, and has fuelled criticism of the government's decision to abandon most pandemic-related restrictions 
Data released on Wednesday night showed COVID-19 prevalence in England hit its highest level on record last month, led by a high number of cases in children and a surge in the south-west of the country.
Pressure is growing on the government to implement its ""Plan B"" aimed at protecting the NHS from unsustainable demands, involving mask mandates, vaccine passes and work-from-home orders.
Many other big economies, including Germany, France and Israel, have either retained some basic COVID-19 measures like mask mandates or reintroduced them in response to rising cases.
The UK government has said its focus remains on administering vaccine boosters and inoculating 12- to 15-year-olds. 
""With no compromises on quality, safety and effectiveness, the public can trust that the MHRA has conducted a robust and thorough assessment of the data (on molnupiravir),"" MHRA chief June Raine said in a statement. 
Last month, Britain agreed a deal with Merck to secure https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-secures-covid-19-antivirals-merck-pfizer-2021-10-20 480,000 courses of molnupiravir.
Professor Penny Ward, an independent pharmaceutical physician, welcomed the approval, but said the NHS needed to outline its plans for rollout and cautioned that supplies were likely to be tight given the strong global demand.
""Comments made by Mr Javid today suggest that it may be made available via a clinical trial, presumably to investigate its effectiveness in vaccinated patients with breakthrough infections, as the original study incorporated unvaccinated adults,"" she said.
If given to everyone becoming unwell, the nearly half a million courses would not last very long given the more than 40,000 current daily case rate, she said.
TREATMENT RACE
In a separate statement, Merck said it expected to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022. 
The U.S.-based drugmaker's shares rose 2.1% to close at $90.54 on Thursday.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Roche are also racing to develop easy-to-administer antiviral pills for COVID-19. 
Both Merck and Pfizer are studying their drugs in late-stage trials for preventing coronavirus infection.
Viral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, Merck has said, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalisations and deaths recently.
While it is not yet clear when Merck will deliver doses to Britain, the company has said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-covid-19-pill-sparks-calls-access-lower-income-countries-2021-10-17 it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country's ability to pay. 

Merck has licensed the drug to generic drugmakers for supply to low-income countries.
Antibody cocktails like those from Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have also been approved for non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients, but have to be given intravenously.

The bid marks a renewed attempt by Carlyle to buy the Sydney-based company after it pursued Link with Pacific Equity Partners in late 2020. The private-equity duo bowed out earlier this year after rival offers emerged.
At the heart of a flurry of interest in Link is its stake in online conveyancing firm PEXA Group, which listed on the Australian stock market in July after Link rejected a bid for the company by KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR).
An unprecedented amount of fiscal spending and low interest rates have contributed to a red-hot Australian housing market that has pushed up home prices by more than a fifth this year.
Carlyle's latest bid includes A$3 per share in cash and a distribution of Link's stake in PEXA worth A$2.38 a share, Link said. Carlyle declined to comment.
In total, Carlyle's offer price is 24.2% above Link's closing price on Thursday, although slightly below its previous offer following a steep fall in Link's shares as the company swung to an annual loss in August.
Link's shares climbed as much as 12.5% to A$4.87 on Friday, their sharpest rise since December 2020, but are still down about 14% so far this year. The were also well below Carlyle's bid, equivalent to A$5.38 a share, indicating market doubts over whether the deal will proceed.
""Shareholders will need to balance short-term interest versus a relatively strong outlook for the company,"" said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments at VanEck, a Link shareholder. 
On Wednesday, Link told shareholders it is targeting revenue growth of 8%-10% over the next five years and earnings margin before interest and tax of 16%-18% by fiscal 2026, compared with the 12.2% it reported for fiscal 2021.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said Link's depressed share price suggested a low level of confidence it could meet the targets.
""This offer therefore would fast track the monetisation of some of the benefits of an earnings recovery,"" it said in a client note. ""We do see scope for other private equity firms to have interest in Link, which sees some upside risk to the offer price.""

Link appointed Macquarie Capital and UBS as advisers, and put its current share buyback on hold.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A spate of high-profile flight cancellations has put a spotlight on worker shortages at U.S. airlines, triggering warnings of new delays over the holiday period as airlines scramble for staff.
It is a dramatic shift for an industry that was grappling with surplus labor as coronavirus hammered air travel just a year ago, and is the latest evidence of a widening labor crunch.
As demand in the United States roars back, carriers are struggling to keep up. The challenge is especially pronounced at American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which have been among the most active in adding seats to meet demand.
American canceled hundreds of flights last weekend, citing weather and staffing. It faced similar turmoil over the summer.
Southwest last month suffered an operational meltdown that resulted in around 2,000 cancellations and cost it $75 million. Similar factors in August forced  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc to cancel 2,800 flights.
Days ahead of the late-November Thanksgiving travel rush, airlines are scrambling to avoid a repeat. 
Meanwhile, they face a surge in holiday bookings amid declining COVID-19 cases and rising vaccinations. Southwest said last month ticket sales for November and December were in line with 2019 pre-crisis levels.
Rising demand and labor shortages have left airlines more vulnerable to bad weather, which frequently mars end-year holiday travel. Analysts say that could mean more travel disruption.
""If there's any weather involved, you can expect flight cancellations,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker.
SCRAMBLING FOR WORKERS
In a staff memo last week, American said it expects to have 4,000 new employees in the current quarter. It is also recalling nearly 1,800 flight attendants from long-term leave.
Southwest aims to hire 5,000 employees by year-end.
The rush to hire in a tight labor market risks driving up costs at a time when soaring jet fuel prices are squeezing profits.
Southwest is offering hiring referral bonuses to employees and has raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Even then, it says applicant rates are below pre-pandemic levels.
""The competition for the talent and for really good talent is even tighter,"" said Greg Muccio, director of talent acquisition at Southwest. ""A lot of folks ... are looking for a lot of flexibility.""
In the interim, both Southwest and Spirit have cut flights to prevent further outages.
Unions blame airlines for poor planning, which they say resulted in fatigue and frustration and made carriers susceptible to such disruptions.
American's pilot union said last month it planned to picket hubs to protest work rotas, fatigue and scarce accommodation. 
""We're very concerned that management is stuffing the holiday turkey with uncertainty for the upcoming holiday travel period,"" said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots at American.
To be sure, not all airlines are feeling the same pressures. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have, thus far, largely avoided some of the turmoil.
Both are flying fewer flights than rivals. United also struck a deal to keep all its pilots flying last year in exchange for reduced work hours and lower pay.
United and Delta restored just over 70% of 2019 capacity in the quarter through September. In comparison, Southwest ramped up its capacity to more than 98% of 2019 levels and American flew 80% of its pre-pandemic capacity.
Industry experts say United and Delta have been partially insulated from the labor squeeze by networks more focused on international markets, where demand remains relatively weak.
SHORTAGES DESPITE BAILOUTS
But recent congestion has triggered broader questions over decisions by some airlines to slash headcount despite receiving $54 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll expenses.
Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, sent letters in July to the heads of six airlines including American, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) to demand explanations of worker shortages after billions in pandemic bailouts. Cantwell said at best each airline ""poorly managed"" the situation and at worst let taxpayers down.
While their responses to the letters have not been made public yet, airlines have said that the bailouts saved thousands of jobs, prevented bankruptcy and put them in a position to support the economy's recovery from the pandemic. 
Industry experts say federal aid did help carriers retain workers, but problems started when the payroll program ran out of funds. With no clarity on funding and travel demand still weak, airlines asked workers to take unpaid time off or retire early.
""Had they retained 100% of their workers, they would have required more cash,"" said Cowen's Becker.
Airlines resumed hiring and bringing back pilots this spring as dipping COVID-19 cases brought passengers back.
U.S. air transportation employment in September was more than 12% below its pre-pandemic peak. By contrast, employment at restaurants and bars, struck equally hard by pandemic lockdowns, is just 7.6% below its peak before the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Executives acknowledge a coronavirus-shattered airline industry is naturally more risk-averse, leading to tentativeness by some carriers when the recovery kicked in. Southwest, for example, didn't get moving with its hiring plans before July.
""We were kind of late to the game,"" said Southwest's Muccio.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum on Friday cut the proved and probable gas reserves estimate for its Greater Pluto region off Western Australia by about 10%, marking the second reserves downgrade in a month and triggering a drop in its shares.
Excluding production in 2021 from the Pyxis hub, Woodside cut its share of proved and probable reserves in Greater Pluto to 394.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) from 440.5 MMboe, following a 4D seismic survey and analysis of well performance.
Those fields feed Woodside's Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, which currently has one processing unit, or train. The company is on the verge of making a final investment decision to add a second Pluto train as part of the $12 billion Scarborough gas project.
By 0315 GMT Woodside shares were down 2.3% at $22.46, while peers' stocks were mostly up or flat and the Sydney benchmark was up 0.5%. The latest downgrade comes hard on the heels of a big downgrade of Woodside's Wheatstone gas reserves last month.

Woodside Chief Executive Meg O'Neill said the company constantly reviews the most efficient way to develop the long-life Greater Pluto asset based on improved understanding of the reservoir, which has been producing since 2012.
""The Greater Pluto region is a significant and valuable resource for Woodside,"" O'Neill said in a statement.

As part of the proposed settlement, Boeing has agreed to hire an ombudsman to handle internal issues and appoint a board member with experience in aviation safety, according to the report on Thursday.
Boeing declined to comment.
In September, a Delaware judge denied the company's move to dismiss the suit, ruling that Boeing's board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over two fatal 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people in less than six months.

The monetary portion of the settlement would be paid by directors' insurers to the corporation, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the agreement.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 10:46PM ET</span>","Jack Ma, Trump and Xi: How Chinese billionaire flew close to the sun","By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - This was supposed to be Jack Ma's finest hour: a year ago to the day, his Ant Group was meant to go public in a $37 billion blaze of glory. Instead Beijing reined in his empire, abruptly clipping the wings of corporate China's biggest star.
Now, to the cautious cheer of investors, the billionaire  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) e-commerce tycoon is taking his first tentative steps back on to the global stage with a low-key trip to Europe where he's cultivating like horticulture.
It's a far cry from the height of Ma's statesman-like powers in 2017 when he travelled to New York to meet President-elect Donald Trump for one-on-one talks in Trump Tower days before inauguration and promised to create a million American jobs.
That high-profile outing had roiled the Chinese government, which first learned of the meeting and jobs pledge along with the rest of the world when Ma held an informal televised Q&A session with reporters in the lobby of the skyscraper, according to four people close to Alibaba with knowledge of the matter and one Beijing government source.
Alibaba's government relations team was subsequently told by Chinese officials that Beijing was unhappy about Ma meeting Trump without its prior approval, two of the people close to the company said. 
Ma's charitable foundation, which handles his media queries, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. All the sources declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. 
The meeting on Jan. 9 came at a time of taut tensions between the two countries after Trump was critical of China during his election campaign, blaming it for the loss of American jobs.
A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.
The four people close to Alibaba said they believed the meeting was a negative turning point in the relationship between Ma and Beijing. They did not elaborate on their thinking.
Investors are hungry for clues about Ma's situation: the mere sighting of the businessman on the Spanish island of Mallorca last month, his first trip abroad in over a year, immediately saw Alibaba gain as much as $42 billion in value. 
The story of his fall from official favour helps illustrate how rapidly China has transformed under Xi Jinping, as he nears what could be a precedent-breaking third term as leader of the economic powerhouse and exerts greater control over some of its most innovative companies. 
'A NATURAL FIRST TARGET'
Authorities cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October last year accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. Regulators suspended the $37 billion listing of his fintech firm Ant Group two days before the planned debut on Nov. 5, ordered that Ant be restructured and launched antitrust investigations into Ma's businesses, eventually leading to a record $2.75 billion fine for Alibaba in April.
The clampdown has spread across the private sector, with officials tightening oversight of companies in technology, real estate, gaming, education, cryptocurrencies and finance. 
""Given that Jack appeared too provocative, out of step with the new approach to governance espoused by Xi, he was a natural first target to signal that a major change had begun,"" said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA China and author of a book on Alibaba and Ma. 
""Jack was rubbing shoulders regularly with foreign presidents, prime ministers, royalty, celebrities at places like Davos or on his own visits overseas. There was a constant stream of VIP visitors to see him in Hangzhou too.""
Ma's global outreach did not end after the Trump meeting, though. 
Between 2018 and 2020 he held talks with a host of high-profile figures, including U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Queen Rania of Jordan, Malaysia's veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad and then Belgian premier Charles Michel, according to Alibaba's news portal Alizila and media reports.
At Alibaba's Hangzhou headquarters, it has a building housing the company's museum where Ma and his business partner Joe Tsai would take foreign visitors and show them around, according to another person close to Ma.
Tsai did not respond to a request for comment via Alibaba. 
Ma had viewed meetings with foreign politicians as ""unofficial diplomacy"" for China, which he enjoyed doing, the person added. 
Alibaba told Reuters it had a guest reception facility widely known as Pavilion 9 that offered a visual tour of its history and an overview of its businesses. It has hosted a wide variety of guests at the exhibition hall in its headquarters, it added.
The company did not respond to other queries for this story. 
'JUST LIKE YOU AND ME'
In a sign of how life has changed for one of China's most successful and influential businessmen, Ma requested an audience with at least two people in Xi's inner circle in the weeks following the blocking of Ant's listing, but his requests were turned down by both, said two separate sources briefed by those people. 
The billionaire subsequently wrote directly to Xi earlier this year offering to devote the rest of his life to China's rural education, according to a government source who said the president spoke about the letter at a meeting of the country's senior leaders in May. 
Reuters could not determine whether Xi approved of or responded to the offer, which has not been previously reported, or precisely when Ma, a former English teacher, penned the missive.
The Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post said last month Ma was visiting Europe on an ""agriculture and technology study tour related to environmental issues"", citing a person familiar with his itinerary.
Last week the paper published pictures of Ma wearing a white protective gown and holding flowerpots. It said he would continue touring European companies and research institutions involved in agricultural infrastructure and plant breeding, citing people familiar with his plans.
Tsai, the co-founder of Alibaba, played down his long-time associate's influence in a rare interview about the elusive billionaire with CNBC's Squawk Box show in June.

""He's lying low right now. I talk to him every day,"" Tsai said. ""The idea that Jack has this enormous amount of power, I think that's not quite right,"" he added. 
""He is just like you and me, he's a normal individual.""

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a ""Withhold Release Order"" that prohibits imports from Smart Glove and its group of companies, the CBP said in a statement on Thursday, a decision it said was based on reasonable evidence that indicates ""Smart Glove production facilities utilise forced labour"".
Smart Glove, which makes gloves used in the medical and food industries, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Malaysian factories - which make everything from palm oil to medical gloves and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone components - have come under increasing scrutiny over allegations from rights groups and workers of abuse of foreign employees, who form a significant part of the manufacturing workforce.
In its statement, the CBP said its investigation identified seven of the 11 forced labour indicators set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) at Smart Glove, but did not say which ones were found.
The ILO indicators include excessive hours, debt bondage, physical and sexual violence, abusive working and living conditions.
The United States banned another glove maker https://www.reuters.com/world/us-bars-malaysian-glove-maker-supermax-over-alleged-labour-abuses-2021-10-21, Supermax Corp, over similar allegations last month. Supermax has said it will speed up a process it had begun in 2019 to meet ILO standards.

FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse will rein in its investment bankers and plough money into looking after the fortunes of the world's rich as it tries to curb a freewheeling culture that has cost it billions in a string of scandals.
Announcing the restructuring on Thursday, Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, who joined from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank in April to bring the Swiss lender to heel, said he was putting risk management and responsibility at the heart of its operations.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank will all but stop funding hedge funds by shutting most of its prime brokerage business, a division blamed for racking up $5.5 billion in losses when investment fund Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March.
The bank's return to its roots with a sharper focus on the world's rich is similar to the approach successfully adopted by arch Swiss rival UBS after it was bailed out during the financial crisis over a decade ago.
The long-awaited reorganisation, however, fell short of the sweeping overhaul expected by some investors. Horta-Osorio admitted that there were no quick fixes, and still a lot to do.
So far this year https://reut.rs/3mKVo2y,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has been fined for arranging a fraudulent loan to Mozambique, hit by the Archegos collapse, tarnished by its involvement with defunct financier Greensill Capital, and rebuked by regulators for spying on its executives. 
The string of scandals has cast a cloud over the bank, prompted an exodus of key staff and wiped billions off its market value, fuelling speculation the bank founded in 1856 could even be bought by a rival.
""It's rather underwhelming. A bit of reshuffling, of reorganisation here and there, and a few exits,"" said Jerome Legras of Axiom Alternative Investments. ""It doesn't sound enough considering what happened over the past months.""
Analysts at Citi said it was a ""modest restructuring"" which relied on growth rather than cutting costs, while Vontobel analysts said it was an evolution that would likely take years. 
To further dampen the mood, the bank posted a 21% fall in third-quarter profit and said it expected a loss in the final three months of 2021 as it writes off some 1.6 billion francs ($1.8 billion) of goodwill related to the investment bank.
Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday afternoon. Analysts said there was general disappointment with the overhaul, though European rivals were also down after the Bank of England failed to raise https://reut.rs/3bEorhB to interest rates as expected. 
BEYOND ACCEPTABLE
The bank's exit from prime broking cements its demise as a major player in the hedge fund industry. In 2010, it was ranked the second-biggest prime broker in the world, outstripping the likes of U.S. giants JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
But a succession of leadership changes and risk oversight branded as ""lackadaisical"" in an independent review culminated in the Archegos losses that triggered its downfall.
The trimmed down investment bank will focus on advising firms on deals and listings and trading cash equities. Credit Suisse will also cut back its lending in emerging markets. 
The bank said the overall reorganisation would save it 1 billion to 1.5 billion francs by 2024.
Horta-Osorio emphasised the history of a national icon, which was founded to finance the construction of Switzerland's pan-Alpine railways and has been central to the country's transformation from a farming nation to financial powerhouse.
It now plans to hire 500 more private bankers over the next three years, with the aim of having 1.1 trillion francs of assets under management by 2024 compared with 0.9 trillion now.
It will simplify its structure into four divisions: its Swiss bank, a global investment bank, asset management and the new global wealth management division which will gradually be allocated more capital at the expense of the investment bank. 
Credit Suisse's financial humiliation is in stark contrast to UBS. In the wake of huge losses during the financial crisis, UBS pivoted away from investment banking and is now the world's largest wealth manager with $3.2 trillion in invested assets.
Credit Suisse's drive to centralise its operations is drawing on lessons from recent failures, including Archegos.
Earlier this year, Credit Suisse published a report blaming a focus on maximizing short-term profits and enabling ""voracious risk-taking"" by Archegos for failing to avoid catastrophe.
Despite long-running discussions about Archegos - by far the bank's largest hedge fund client - Credit Suisse's top management were apparently unaware of the risks it was taking.

""Obviously when Archegos and Greensill happened they were absolutely beyond what I thought would be acceptable,"" Horta-Osorio said. ""There is a clear understanding in the organisation that these types of things mustn't happen again.""

International travel search volumes have been rising as countries, including the United States, start to ease pandemic-related restrictions for fully vaccinated visitors. 
Easing lockdowns have helped Airbnb recover from a steep drop in business early last year as leisure-seeking domestic travelers booked homes away from major cities. It now expects cross-border travel to further boost its revenue. 
""We are seeing recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel this year, while domestic and short-distance travel continue to be more popular than 2019 levels,"" the company said in a statement.
The vacation rental said the recovery was dominated by North America and Europe - regions with higher average daily rates. It rose 15% to about $149 in the third quarter from a year earlier.
For the Thanksgiving week in the United States, Airbnb said as of Sept. 30, nights booked are 40% higher than same period in 2019.
With the pandemic causing a permanent step up in the lodging industry mix, analysts expect Airbnb to continue to grow in the alternative accommodation market, in which it has a more than 50% share among global online travel agents. 
In the third quarter, gross bookings rose 48.8% to $11.9 billion. However, it missed market expectations of $12.23 billion. 

Revenue rose 66.7% to $2.24 billion and beat estimates of $2.05 billion. Net income surged nearly four times to $833.9 million from a year earlier.
Airbnb forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $1.39 billion and $1.48 billion. Analysts on average estimated $1.44 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

""Travel demand and confidence levels are high,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said at the airline's annual meeting. 
""Domestically, the crucial Melbourne-Sydney route has started to ramp up,"" he said. ""And most states have outlined their plans to open their borders before Christmas – one of the busiest travel times of the year.""

Australia eased its international border restrictions on Monday for the first time during the pandemic, allowing some of its vaccinated public to travel freely and many families to reunite, sparking emotional embraces at airports.

Qantas last month said all 11,000 of the airline's staff idled without pay, around half its workforce, will return to work by early December as domestic and international flying returns to more normal levels.
Qantas Chairman Richard Goyder said the airline remained on track to choose the preferred suppliers for an order of more than 100 planes to replace its current domestic fleet by the end of the calendar year.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 07:16PM ET</span>","'Bear of the Pyrenees', former Airbus CEO Jean Pierson dies","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Jean Pierson, the ""Bear of the Pyrenees"" who propelled planemaker Airbus onto the global stage and began its transformation from a loose consortium into a European giant, has died, former colleagues said on Thursday.
Pierson died on Wednesday aged 80 in France, they said. 
The Frenchman was Airbus' longest-serving chief executive, between 1985 and 1998, and was credited with breaking into Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s home market in the United States, kickstarting one of the world's greatest business rivalries.
""He was a great personality and leader. He brought Airbus from a startup to compete head-to-head with Boeing,"" said former spokeswoman Barbara Kracht, whose father co-founded Airbus.
A burly and voracious dealmaker who grew up outside the narrow Parisian-educated circle that dominated French industry, Pierson strode factory floors and exhorted sales teams to take on Boeing on its home turf despite executives' initial wariness.
In 1997, he landed a breakthrough order for 400 jets from U.S. Airways for which he dropped his trousers in protest against a last-minute discount demand, a tactic first recounted in a 2007 book ""Boeing vs Airbus"", which he later confirmed.
On another occasion, Pierson told Reuters, he ripped off his shirt, telling a tenacious airline boss that the garment might as well be thrown into the aggressively priced deal.
""He was an inspirational leader. He didn't care about his salary and all he cared about was the people and the success of Airbus,"" said Mohamed El Borai, president of Reliance Aerospace and a former Pierson employee.
Nicknamed the ""Bear of the Pyrenees,"" the gruff steak-loving businessman and bon vivant took gambles that still shape an industry where success or failure is measured in decades.
He strongly backed the A380 superjumbo, which flopped in the market and is about to see its last delivery after just 14 years. But he accurately predicted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-a400m-idUSTRE6570NK20100608 that the A400M military plane would cause trouble for the then civil manufacturer. It has just won its second export order in 16 years and blown huge losses.
'LIAR'S CLUB'
""He knew how to build airplanes and knew that to succeed in a duopoly you can't be a small player,"" said John Leahy, the uncompromising American promoted over Europeans by Pierson to fill the job of sales chief, which he held for over https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-leahy-idUSKBN1CG1QE two decades.
Pierson fought for the future A320 cash cow and threw aides who proposed a different cockpit for the sister A321 out of his office, Leahy said. The one-cockpit strategy set the stage for A321 sales that underpin profits of a new management today.
Pierson was ""a great humanist behind the bear facade,"" said current Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer.
Airbus was founded in 1969 as a venture between industrial groups in France, Germany, Spain and Britain and went on to snatch Boeing's crown as the world's largest planemaker.
Crucially, former aides say, Pierson began a long process of integration by declaring the original consortium outdated.
A veteran of shareholder meetings known internally as the ""Liar's Club"" after the propensity of partners to disguise costs, Pierson campaigned for Airbus to become a single company.
Rather than buying jets from shareholders and selling and supporting them abroad, Airbus would need more control.

After retiring to his fishing boat, Pierson made few appearances as the company plunged into more than a decade of in-fighting under new partners, but he broke silence in 2007 to warn Franco-German power-sharing would fail. 
The idea was abandoned in 2013, though the countries remain as shareholders.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>",Uber makes first operating profit as driver shortage eases,"By Tina Bellon and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Thursday reported its first profitable quarter on an adjusted basis since it launched more than a decade ago with its two most important segments, ride-hailing and restaurant delivery, both turning the corner.
Company executives allayed investor concerns about a shortage of drivers, telling analysts that spending on incentives to entice drivers back on the road after the pandemic was largely behind the company.
But a massive drop in the value of its stake in Chinese ridehailing company Didi drove a $2.4 billion net loss in the third quarter, and Wall Street viewed Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s fourth-quarter forecast as disappointing. Shares bounced in after-hours trade and were up about 1% as Uber briefed Wall Street in a call.
The California-based company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure that excludes one-time costs such as stock-based compensation, of $8 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compared to a loss on the same basis of $625 million a year ago.
Uber forecast an adjusted profit of $25 million to $75 million for the last quarter of 2021. Analysts on average expected $114 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Despite the adjusted profit, Uber's earnings report came as a disappointment after smaller U.S. rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Tuesday reported its second consecutive quarterly adjusted profit at $67.3 million and said it expected adjusted EBITDA of between $70 million and $75 million in the fourth quarter.
Uber's and Lyft's operations have yet to become profitable on a net basis, and the companies decline to provide guidance of when that might happen.
A drop in value of Uber's holding in Chinese ride service Didi and stock-based compensation payments resulted in a net loss that more than doubled from last year.

In Uber's real-world business, total revenue grew 72% to $4.8 billion, above an average analyst estimate of $4.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Uber's delivery business, which includes restaurant food and store deliveries, emerged as the company's backbone during the pandemic. Delivery revenue saw a steady increase in the third quarter, signaling that growth in riders did not come at the expense of its Uber Eats unit.
The company's core restaurant delivery business, which makes up some 96% of delivery gross bookings, was profitable for the first time on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the third quarter, Uber said.
Consumers were traveling in greater numbers in the third quarter and its driver and courier base had grown by nearly 640,000 people since January, Uber said. The company spent more than $250 million https://www.reuters.com/technology/uber-lyft-tout-us-ride-hail-driver-pay-incentives-amid-demand-uptick-2021-04-07 to lure drivers back after the pandemic.
Uber did not provide data on how driver numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels. Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the company wanted to grow its driver base beyond 2019 levels to meet expected demand.
Ride bookings in the quarter remained more than 20% below third-quarter levels in 2019, but Uber said ride unit margins had returned to pre-pandemic levels.
""Investors want to see a meaningful recovery in the gross bookings for Uber's ride-hailing service which is a high-margin business compared to UberEats,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com.

While Uber said Halloween weekend surpassed 2019, demand from riders traveling for parties and fun is at about 80% of pre-pandemic levels, executives said during an analyst earnings call.
U.S. airport trips, among the most profitable routes in the industry, increased in recent weeks, but lagged all other ride categories, remaining around 33% below pre-pandemic levels.

Shares of the company rose 6.5% after the bell on Thursday, as increased demand from large retail advertisers and growth in its international business boosted third-quarter revenue 43%.
Advertisers in the consumer packaged goods segment, however, were hurt by global supply chain constraints, impacting Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)'s revenue growth rate. 
In a post earnings call, the company also said it did not face any material impact from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes which have made it difficult for social media companies to target audiences and measure advertising capabilities. 
Pinterest's monthly active users (MAU), meanwhile, grew just 1% to 444 million, missing Factset estimates of 460 million. Last year, the company had notched a 37% surge as users stuck at home turned to social media to keep themselves entertained.
""We believe the slowdown was due to the pandemic unwind,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said in an interview. Many GenZ users are returning to school, while others who had used the app to explore cooking and home decor projects during lockdowns are now venturing out more, he added.
Still, in a sign that the pandemic-accelerated shift to online shopping may be here to stay, Pinterest's quarterly revenue of $633 million surpassed analysts' average estimate of $630.9 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its users, called ""pinners"", using the app's shopping features increased 60% from a year ago. 

Net income was $94 million, or 14 cents per share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $94.2 million, or 16 cents per share, a year ago.
Excluding items, it gained 28 cents per share, above estimates of 23 cents per share.

“The market had been positioning for higher yields in general given the Fed announcement of tapering. As we walked in today, there has been a reversal in that.”

Better-than-expected third-quarter earnings have helped lift sentiment for equities. With about 420 companies having reported, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 41.2% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Oil producers haven been posting higher results this quarter as commodities prices bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic.
Occidental shares, up 95% this year, rose a fraction in late Thursday trading to $33.90. 
Occidental reported per share earnings of 65 cents in the third quarter. Adjusted earnings were 87 cents a share, beating the market's consensus estimate of 66 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. The producer had a loss of $4.07 per share in the same period last year. 
Occidental has ""generated record free cash flow before working capital in each quarter this year, allowing us to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet,” Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement.
Occidental is joining a group of U.S. oil producers using the proceeds of higher oil prices to cut debt and increase free cash flow, with cash distribution to shareholders. It repaid $4.3 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, bringing it down to $30.92 billion. 

Its chemical business last quarter generated record earnings, and the company forecast a $480 million pre-tax profit for this quarter.
Fourth-quarter oil and gas production could be between 1.13 million and 1.16 million barrels per day, the company said, flat to slightly below third-quarter production from continuing operations.

Privately-owned Chanel, one of the biggest brands in the 280-billion euros ($340 billion) global luxury industry, and rival LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton have weathered the coronavirus crisis better than most other retailers and have raised prices several times to boost their profit margins. 
Sales at Chanel fell 17.6% last year, but the core profit margin stood at around 20%, according to analysts, making it one of the most profitable companies in the sector. It said in June it expects revenues to increase by double digits this year compared with their 2019, pre-pandemic levels. 
The price of Chanel's Small Classic handbag has gone up by 16% to 7,300 euros ($8,429) since the end of September. The hike, first reported by French news channel BFM TV, was confirmed by Reuters using the Internet Archive, a repository of past web pages.
The price of another popular handbag, the quilted leather 2.55 with a golden chain, was 7,800 euros on Chanel's website on Thursday compared with 6,050 euros in December 2020, an increase of nearly 30%, the Reuters analysis showed.
A spokesman for the group which is also known for its tweed suits and No. 5 perfume, said in an email that the price increase ""only concerns our iconic models, namely the Timeless Classic and the 2.55.""
Like all major luxury brands, we regularly adjust our prices to take into account changes in our production costs and raw material prices, as well as exchange rate fluctuations,"" the spokesman said, without giving further details.
Price adjustments are made in such a way as to avoid excessive differences between regions, the spokesman added. 

In June, Chanel's finance chief had told Reuters that the group had not yet increased prices in 2021, but that this could change in the second half -- in line with its policy of reviewing prices worldwide twice a year.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Italian government should hasten plans to help Monte dei Paschi raise cash on the market, the CEO of the Tuscan bank said, after the government failed to clinch a sale to bigger rival UniCredit.
Italy's Treasury has said it will support a new share issue at Monte dei Paschi (MPS), of which it owns 64%, but wants other investors to join in to avoid breaking European Union state aid rules.
To make the proposition attractive after UniCredit walked away from a potential acquisition, Rome first wants to rid MPS of all its problem loans and any non-ordinary legal risks, sources have said. 
MPS said on Thursday it no longer expected to face a capital shortfall next year, pushing it back to 2023, but it still needed more capital to operate properly.
""Already in 2021 we have seen the impact of not having implemented a capital increase ... (we face) capital constraints,"" Chief Executive Guido Bastianini told analysts.
""From the bank's perspective if it has to do it, best to do it sooner rather than later,"" he added.
Pending the sale to UniCredit, MPS has put on hold a new business plan Bastianini had readied after MPS fell behind on restructuring commitments taken with the EU Commission.
The Treasury is now discussing with the EU an update of that plan, which envisaged a 2.0-2.5 capital increase, to gain approval for the cash call, which sources says is likely to be bigger.
MPS has delayed staff exits and Bastianini said it had cost the bank ""a lot of money"" the fact that it had not renegotiated the staff's contract with unions.
Italian banks lay off staff only through costly early retirement plans and MPS needs more capital to be able to do that.
MPS said it now expected a projected shortfall in its Tier1 capital after Jan. 1, 2023 and no longer by mid-2022.

The bank swung to a profit of 186.0 million euros in the July-September period, from a loss of 450.6 million euros a year earlier thanks to a 131.5 million euro write up on two loans that returned to be performing. 
Funds borrowed at negative rates from the European Central Bank drove income from the lending business up 2.5% quarter on quarter, while net fees fell 6.3% due to slow commercial banking and asset management activity in the summer months.

This is good news for the global economy and auto parts stocks which will see a spike in revenue as auto production returns to full capacity.One of the major challenges currently facing the global economy is the shortage of semiconductors. These chips are used in all sorts of products beyond laptops, tablets, and smartphones. They are now essential for products such as refrigerators, washing machines, and automobiles. Due to these shortages, there are negative, secondary effects for the companies that manufacture the other components used in these products. 
Auto parts companies are maybe the best example. These companies are seeing revenue reductions as original equipment manufacturers (OEM) are placing smaller orders. However, there is a silver lining as many auto manufacturers noted in their earnings calls that the semiconductor shortage improved in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. Another constructive data point is that the number of new cars produced in October is estimated to be 13 million, an increase from 12 million in September.
This is the first sequential improvement in new car production since March when we peaked at 18 million new cars produced. This is also consistent with other data points such as shipping rates and the number of ships waiting off of ports declining, indicating that September may have been the “bottom” when it came to supply chain issues. Given that production should keep improving in 2022, 3 auto parts stocks that investors should consider buying are Meritor (NYSE:MTOR), Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT).

The U.S. insurer posted an underwriting income of $20 million in its general insurance business in the third quarter, compared with a $423 million loss a year earlier.
The business recorded catastrophe losses of $628 million, mainly from Hurricane Ida and floods in the United Kingdom and Europe. That compared with $790 million a year ago, which included $185 million of estimated COVID-19 losses.
Global insurers last year faced a sharp rise in payouts related to the health crisis, but a wider availability of COVID-19 vaccines has eased the pressure.
Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG's common shareholders rose to $837 million in the quarter to Sept. 30, from $708 million a year earlier.
AIG earned 97 cents per share on an adjusted basis, beating analysts' estimates of 88 cents, according to Refinitiv.
The company's general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes catastrophe losses - was 90.5 for the quarter, compared with 93.3 a year earlier.
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Gross premiums written rose 13% to $8.3 billion in the general insurance business.

AIG's life and retirement unit posted a 13% fall in adjusted pre-tax income to $877 million.
The company said the planned initial public offering of the unit, in which Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) has bought a sizeable stake, was on track for 2022.

LONDON (Reuters) - Currys, Britain's biggest electricals retailer, is well stocked despite supply chain disruption and confident it will enjoy a strong Black Friday and Christmas trading period, its boss said on Thursday.
British retailers are grappling with delays in their international supply chains that are being compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks.
Alex Baldock, CEO of Currys, which was previously called Dixons Carphone (LON:CURY), said the firm had worked hard to mitigate the risks and as UK market leader had an advantage with suppliers, such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Hewlett Packard and Arcelik, in having first call on scarce stock.
""It's been incredibly hard work but we're in quite good shape. We've got more stock in the business now than we had last year and we're confident that we're going to have a strong peak trading period,"" he told reporters at Currys' Staples Corner store in north west London, where he hosted a Capital Markets Day.
""Are we going to have every item in every sub-category that we would ideally like in every store, probably not,"" he said.
""But to give you a sense of perspective, we might be talking about offering 120 large screen televisions rather than 140.""
Baldock was asked if there would be any product categories where Currys would be totally out of stock.
""The short answer is no, we're not calling that out as a problem,"" he said.
Separately on Thursday, Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest supermarket group and the owner of the Argos general merchandise chain, warned shoppers to prepare for a shortage of consumer electronics products this Christmas.

Earlier, Currys said strong demand for tech products pushed its six-month sales up 15% compared with the same period before the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling it to launch a $100 million share buyback.
Its shares closed up 8.8%, extending year-on-year gains to 31%.

PARIS (Reuters) - Retailer Casino said on Thursday that sales momentum gradually improved in the third quarter, as easing COVID-19 restrictions helped its performance in France and sales growth in Brazil, the group's second-largest market, remained robust.
Casino, which has been boosting its profitability through purchasing deals and cost cuts, reiterated a target of core profit (EBITDA) growth for its French retail business in 2021 and unveiled a new partnership with German quick commerce group Gorillas.
Casino has already been expanding online through a deal to use British online retailer Ocado’s fulfillment platform, while its Monoprix supermarket arm has a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Commenting on the new partnership, which will also see Casino buying a ""symbolic"" stake in Gorillas, finance chief David Lubek said: ""We will benefit from their growth because we will sell them our products. We have partnerships with Ocado (LON:OCDO), Amazon. We have Gorillas for quick commerce. We are now well covered on e-commerce,"" 
Under the deal, Casino will give Gorillas access to its national brands products, but also to Monoprix’s private label products, which will be available through Gorillas’ app and delivered within minutes to customers in Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, Lyon and Nice, the group said.
Gorillas will also undertake packing and fast delivery of orders purchased on Monoprix and Franprix online platforms from its French micro-fulfilment stores.
Casino, which has been selling assets to reduce its debt burden, confirmed it was pressing ahead with a disposal plan aimed at raising 4.5 billion euros ($5.2 billion), with 3.1 billion of deals signed or secured to date.
Sales at the group, which controls Brazil's Grupo Pao de Acucar, totalled 7.7 billion euros in the third quarter.
On a same-store basis and excluding fuel and calendar effects, group sales rose 1%. That compares to a 4.1% decline in the second quarter when its city stores in France suffered from a lack of tourists and coronavirus curfew measures.
In France alone, sales were down 4.3% in the quarter after falling 8.4% in the second quarter, still affected by a drop in traffic during summer in the Paris region and the implementation of a health pass. French hypermarkets sales were down 9.5% in the quarter after falling 11.4% in the second quarter.

The Nasdaq climbed 0.94%, and had earlier notched a record of 15,961.4. The S&P 500 rose 0.16% and hit an earlier all-time high of 4,682.55. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.45%, or 162 points.
A chip-led rally in tech following a surge in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia propelled the broader market higher.
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped more than 13% after {{0|Wells)) Fargo hiked its price target on the stock to $320 per share from $245, on expectations demand the chipmaker's open virtual platform, Omniverse, is set to benefit from the potential metaverse opportunity.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was up more than 12% after shrugging off the chip storage to deliver better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) climbed more than 3% on the day.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the top-performing sectors, underpinned by a 14% jump in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) after reporting third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.
The arts and crafts platform guided Q4 revenue in range of $660 million to $690 million, just shy of estimates for $693.74 million, though management commentary on a limited impact of supply-chain issues in the run up to the holidays supported investor sentiment.
""Management noted that 90% of Etsy sellers source materials locally which should help limit any impact to inventory sellouts and at the same time allow Etsy to benefit from out-of-stock products at larger retailers,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) were also among the biggest sector gainers, with the latter up more than 3% after detailing plans to repurchase $5 billion in junk bonds in a bid to strengthen its balance sheet and restore its credit rating.
Against slew of better-than-expected quarterly results,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) proved one of the notable exceptions, tumbling 19%, as earnings as well as revenue fell short of estimates. The drug maker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine sales forecast for the year.
Merck & Inc (NYSE:MRK) rose 1% after it its Covid-19 pill received approval in the UK.
A slide in financials, however, paced by falling banking stocks, kept a lid on gains in the broader market.
Bank stocks were on the backfoot following a fall in U.S. Treasury yields in the wake of the Federal Reserve signaling on Wednesday that it would be no rush to begin raising rates despite plans to begin tapering its monthly bond purchases later this month.  
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), and Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) were down sharply, with latter down more than 6%.
Energy were under pressure after the OPEC+ alliance agreed to stick with the current production plan despite calls from President Joe Biden to ramp-up production to ease the jump in energy prices.
On the economic front, jobless claims fell more than expected, stoking investor optimism about a recovery in the labor market just a day ahead of the Friday's nonfarm payroll report."

Investing.com — Analysts downgraded shares of Texas-based  Upland Software Inc  (NASDAQ:UPLD) after it reported third-quarter earnings that missed expectations on revenue and disappointed on sales growth. 
Investors have reacted negatively to the report, pushing the shares down 24%, to $25.56. 
As a result of the company's Q3 earnings, analysts at both Jefferies and Craig-Hallum have downgraded the stock. 
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill put a hold rating on the stock, down from buy, simultaneously lowering the price target to $30 from $50. Thill cited the company's sales growth as being 3% below the Street, adding that the miss was driven by a deceleration in volume-based messaging activity and limited net new logo traction. The analyst also noted that it was the third time in a row that Upland had not delivered a beat on the top line. 
Jeff Van Rhee, an analyst at Craig-Hallum, said Upland posted a ""very uncharacteristic"" miss and that restructuring has not gone as planned. Rhee added that that weakening retention may prove more challenging to repair. As a result, Rhee downgraded the stock to hold from buy, halving the price target to $32 from $64."

Judge Richard Hertling of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington granted the government's motion to dismiss the suit filed on Aug. 16 https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/blue-origin-sues-us-government-over-spacex-lunar-lander-contract-2021-08-16. The judge's opinion explaining his reasoning was sealed, as were many other documents in the case, pending a meeting this month on proposed redactions.
Blue Origin, created by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Bezos, expressed disappointment. ""Not the decision we wanted, but we respect the court’s judgment, and wish full success for NASA and SpaceX on the contract,"" Bezos wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
NASA said on Thursday ""it will resume work with SpaceX"" on the lunar lander contract ""as soon as possible."" The space agency added it ""continues working with multiple American companies to bolster competition and commercial readiness for crewed transportation to the lunar surface.""
NASA halted work https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-idCAKBN2FK26Z-OCATC on the lunar lander contract through Nov. 1, part of an agreement among the parties to expedite the litigation schedule, which culminated in Thursday's ruling.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) in July sided with the NASA over its decision to pick a single lunar lander provider, rejecting Blue Origin's protest.
SpaceX, headed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Musk, joined the proceedings as an intervener shortly after the lawsuit was filed.
NASA had sought proposals for a spacecraft that would carry astronauts to the lunar surface under its Artemis program to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972.

NASA said on Thursday ""there will be forthcoming opportunities for companies to partner with NASA in establishing a long-term human presence at the Moon under the agency’s Artemis program, including a call in 2022 to U.S. industry for recurring crewed lunar landing services.""
SpaceX did not immediately comment.

Read on.The heightened tech spending by enterprises for more than a year in response to imperatives created by the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually declining. Also, supply-chain disruptions and a prolonged semiconductor shortage are marring the industry’s growth. “I think numbers will be solid but won’t show that exponential growth that we saw over the last few quarters,” said Maribel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research. S&P 500 tech companies are expected to report 29% year-over-year earnings growth in the third quarter, a marked slowdown versus the second quarter’s 48% growth.
The semiconductor chip shortage is hamstringing the production of electronics and restraining the production capabilities of several companies in this space. And the industry is expected to remain hampered by the chip shortage and supply and logistical challenges until 2022.

 Vimeo  (NASDAQ:VMEO) shares are down over 27% after the video software provider posted a slight revenue beat but unimpressive guidance for investors.
Vimeo, which was spun out of InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC) in May, reported revenue of $100.1M in Q3, its first $100M revenue quarter and 33% above last year’s numbers. Gross margin came in at 75% and the company produced -$.07/share in earnings; free cash flow was $9.3M, with the difference mostly coming from the accounting for share-based compensation.
“Vimeo delivered its first $100 million revenue quarter as the need for video at work grows,” said Anjali Sud, Chief Executive Officer of Vimeo, in the press release. “More than 6,000 enterprise customers can now use our all-in-one software solution to leverage the power of professional-quality video.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada would respond ""appropriately"" to proposed U.S. electric vehicle tax credits for American-built vehicles, which it says would harm workers on both sides of the border, Innovation and Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Thursday.
Champagne, who previously served as foreign minister for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, White House Science Advisor Eric Lander and Michigan Senator Gary Peters in Washington this week.
""They understand that legislation like that would generate a response on the Canadian side,"" Champagne told Reuters in a telephone interview from Washington. ""We have always responded appropriately to these types of legislation."" 
The House of Representatives could vote as early as Friday on a social spending and climate bill that includes a $4,500 incentive for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any of the $12,500 credit.
Champagne said the tariffs would run against the rules of the North American trade agreement - the USMCA - and World Trade Organization.
They ""would be really contrary to the spirit... of what we have been trying to achieve with our American colleagues,"" which is a joint effort to pivot toward greener technologies to fight climate change, Champagne said. 
""My message to (U.S. officials) is that a decision like that... would impact jobs on both sides of the border, and at a time where we need to work closely together with respect to critical minerals with respect to the battery ecosystem,"" Champagne said.
""The response has been an understanding of the impact that the proposed legislation could have,"" he added.
Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association has said that the credits would hurt Canadian parts makers that employ some 43,000 American workers in 18 states. 
Canada's industrial heartland of Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV have all announced plans to make electric vehicles (EVs) at factories in the province.
The three U.S. manufacturers make some 1 million vehicles in Canada for American consumers, containing 50% U.S. parts and 60% U.S. raw materials. 
Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly spoke on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the tax credits. 
""As close partners with deeply integrated supply chains, particularly in the automotive sector, Canada and the United States must work together to find a mutually beneficial solution,"" she said in a statement about their discussion.
When former U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, including aluminum, Canada retaliated with its own duties. The proposed tax credits have faced opposition from non-U.S. automakers and governments. 
Canada is rich in key materials for EV battery production - including lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel - and is trying to woo battery makers - including Germany's BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) -to safeguard the future of its manufacturing in Ontario as the world seeks to cut emissions.

Champagne, who is flying to Mexico City to speak with his counterpart there later on Thursday, will visit Europe next week and will meet with battery maker executives, the minister said.
""I've been in touch with the major players in the sector for months now,"" he said. ""Canada certainly has distinctive advantages for them to be locating in Canada to serve the North American auto market.""

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is testing ways for creators to make money through Facebook Groups, such as users paying fees for exclusive access to content or conversations within subgroups, the company said on Thursday.
Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, said the test was part of its broader paid subscription effort. The social media company is one of many tech giants that have been working to woo social media creators and their large followings through payments and new tools. 
Facebook, which has in recent years focused on building communities as a tactic to drive engagement on the site, said Group administrators will be able to run e-commerce shops to sell merchandise or create community fundraisers, which could offset the costs of running a Group. 
On Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said that creators would be able to share custom links allowing them to accept payments directly, in a swipe at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s subscription fees. Facebook launched its subscriptions service last year. 
The company announced a series of updates to its Groups product during its live-streamed Communities Summit. It said the subgroups feature, which can be free or paid, would allow members to break off within groups to focus on certain regions or topics. 
Facebook Groups have been under scrutiny from lawmakers and researchers who argue that they provide closed spaces for health misinformation, violent rhetoric and extremism to proliferate without being properly policed. 
A company spokesperson said Facebook was testing community fundraisers with select Groups and that Groups created in the last 30 days, violate its content rules or frequently share harmful content or misinformation were not eligible.

Facebook said Group administrators would get tools to customize their group's appearance and members would soon be able to give ""community awards"" for valuable posts.
The company also teased a new experience combining ""the best of Groups and Pages in one place,"" and said it would allow administrators of Pages to use the same moderation tools as Groups. It said this was in early testing over the next year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could revive domestic production of super strong magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines with government support, to cut its reliance on China and achieve vital cuts in carbon emissions, two sources with direct knowledge said.
A government-funded feasibility study is due to be published on Friday, laying out the steps Britain must take to restart output of rare earth permanent magnets, the sources said.
A magnet factory would help Britain, hosting the COP26 U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, meet its goal of banning petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and slashing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.
British production of the magnets vanished in the 1990s when industry found it could not compete with China, but with the huge growth in demand the government is keen to secure enough supply.
Last month, the government set out plans to achieve its net zero strategy, which includes spending 850 million pounds ($1.15 billion) to support the roll out of electric vehicles (EVs) and their supply chains.
The study outlines how a plant could be built by 2024 and eventually produce enough of the powerful magnets to supply 1 million EVs a year, the sources who have read the report said.
""We're looking to turn the tide of shipping all this kind of manufacturing to the Far East and resurrect UK manufacturing excellence,"" one of the sources said.
The government's Department for Business declined to comment on details regarding a possible magnet factory because the report has not been released. 
""The government continues to work with investors through our Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) to progress plans to build a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the UK,"" a spokesperson said in an email.
EV RAMP UP
British rare earths company Less Common Metals put together the feasibility study and is considering seeking partners to jointly build the factory, the sources said.
LCM is one of the only companies outside of China that transforms rare earth raw materials into the special compounds needed to produce permanent magnets. 
Automakers will need the magnets as they ramp up EV output in Britain - Ford said last month it would invest up to 230 million pounds in an English plant to produce around 250,000 EV power units a year from mid-2024. 
Rare earth magnets made of neodymium are used in 90% of EV motors because they are widely seen as the most efficient way to power them. 
Electric cars with these magnets require less battery power than those with ordinary magnets, so vehicles can travel longer distances before recharging. 
A race by automakers to ramp up EVs and countries to switch to wind energy is due to boost demand for permanent magnets in Europe as much as tenfold by 2050, according to the European Union. 
The sources said government support would be vital so Britain could compete with China, which produces 90 percent of supply.

The strategy mirrors similar efforts by the EU and the United States to create domestic industries of raw materials, rare earth processing and permanent magnets.

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc on Thursday slashed the 2021 sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine by as much as $5 billion, grappling to fill vials and distribute them to meet unprecedented world demand, sending its shares tumbling 16%. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) executives said production challenges now lie with bottling up doses, also known as fill and finish, and ramping up infrastructure to deliver them internationally, rather than production of raw material. 
""We really believe we can fix those short-term supply issues .... those are what I would qualify as teething problems of scaling up so fast,"" Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel told analysts on a conference call.
Moderna shares were down 16.3% at $289.50. 
The U.S. drugmaker is hiring more manufacturing workers and investing additional resources in its production lines to increase the number of doses it can release each week, Bancel said.
Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines, like those of its peer  Pfizer , require more demanding cold storage than other shots, creating logistical challenges in shipping them, especially to poorer countries that lack extensive cold storage infrastructure.
The company's sales target cut is in sharp contrast to that of larger rival Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), which earlier this week raised the sales forecast for its shot.
Moderna's contract manufacturer Lonza has been ramping up manufacturing, and Moderna has also enlisted Spain's Rovi, another contract drugmaker that is already bottling Moderna's vaccine, to build new ingredient production facilities in Granada to lift European output.
Bancel said the work was now complete, and ""we should see a positive impact from this expansion very soon.""
Besides production challenges, the vaccine has also been under scrutiny over the rare risk of heart inflammation known as myocarditis. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the weekend delayed its review of Moderna's vaccine in children and teens aged 12 to 17 years, to assess the risk of myocarditis.
Moderna executives said its safety analysis do not show an increased risk in individuals below 18 years of age. 
""We think, over time, the substantial benefits of our vaccine will ultimately win out here. And so we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA,"" said Moderna President Stephen Hoge. 
Moderna said it was now expecting 2021 sales of between $15 billion and $18 billion from $20 billion estimated previously.

Deliveries were pegged between 700 million and 800 million doses for the year, down from its prior forecast of between 800 million to 1 billion. 
Still, Moderna said its sales could be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion next year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global supply chain disruption is changing cargo flows coming into Britain and smaller ports such as Liverpool are benefiting as suppliers look for other ways to route cargoes and minimise disruptions, Liverpool port's operator said. 
    Major bottlenecks have formed across the globe in recent months due to a surge in demand for retail goods from people stuck at home under pandemic-related lockdowns and logjams impacting the supply of container ships and boxes to transport cargo.
    A shortage of truckers has added to difficulties especially in Britain, which also faces logistics pressures after leaving the European Union as border checks are now required at EU ports. 
    Container lines have used megaships of some 19,000-20,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), the size of four football fields, to haul consumer goods across the world. But the logjams have meant such vessels have been stuck waiting to load or discharge.  
    In recent weeks top shipping lines including Maersk and MSC have omitted some UK port calls including Felixstowe in eastern England and diverted cargo onboard bigger ships to European ports to be re-routed onto smaller vessels and ""transshipped"" back to Britain.  
    ""We are seeing the benefit of these cargoes being transshipped into Europe,"" said Mark Whitworth, chief executive of Peel Ports, which operates Liverpool port.
Whitworth added that smaller 1,500 TEU container ships sailing from China had been calling at Liverpool in recent months to speed up deliveries, something that was previously not ""economically viable"" due to the scale needed and costs involved.
Container freight rates have risen to record levels this year providing shipping lines with their best earnings in years.        
    Situated in the northwest of England, Liverpool's deep water port has become a bigger hub for the north of the country avoiding congestion at southern gateways and national driver shortages, which has cut journey time for goods.

Investing.com — Several analysts slashed their prices targets on  Roku  Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) after its earnings report.
The analysts cited various reasons for the reductions, from the company's fourth quarter outlook to supply chain issues. 
At Pivotal Research, Roku's share price target was lowered to $350 from $410, with analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak saying the company reported weaker than expected Q3 new active accounts and a worse than expected Q4 financial guidance as supply chain issues hit TV sales. 
{{0|Deutsche Bank} analyst Jeffrey Rand said the company reported a ""mixed"" Q3. Rand believes macro uncertainty around supply chain constraints and inflationary costs will have a more significant impact on Roku than previously expected. As a result, rand lowered Roku's price target $400 from $500, keeping an overweight rating.
Justin Patterson at KeyBanc lowered Roku's price target to $305 from $350, stating that he expects supply chain headwinds to have a larger impact on net adds. 
Steven Cahall at Wells Fargo stated the company's outlook is weighed down by global inventory challenges. Cahall put a price target of $305 on the shares, down from $350. However, he kept the equal weight rating. 
 Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said the company's Q4 guidance suggests ""a surprising revenue declaration."" As a result, Swinburne lowered his firm's price target on Roku to $295 from $310. 
Elsewhere, Loop Capital lowered the Roku price target to $410, DA Davidson reduced it to $550, Wedbush lowered it to $365, and Oppenheimer dropped its Roku price target to $400. 
Roku shares have predictably fallen on Thursday, down over 7% at $291.27."
1527,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>",Explainer: The legal challenges awaiting Biden's vaccine mandate,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Business groups, state attorneys general and religious organizations have promised swift court challenges to try to block the vaccine-and-testing mandate unveiled on Thursday by the Biden administration.
President Joe Biden has said the country's patience is growing thin with the 30% of Americans who are not fully vaccinated, and the rule is aimed at ensuring safe workplaces.
The vaccine requirement is being imposed through a rarely used process that has a history of being blocked by judges.
Here is a look at the rule and how it might be challenged.
WHAT IS THE RULE?
Imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the rule requires all businesses with at least 100 employees to ensure they are vaccinated or submit to weekly testing and wearing a face covering.
OSHA rules typically take seven years to develop. This rule is being issued through an emergency temporary standard (ETS), a process that allows OSHA to address a ""grave danger"" and is aimed at protecting against that hazard.
Prior to an ETS issued in June that applied to healthcare settings, OSHA had issued nine emergency temporary standards since it was set up in 1971. Of those, six were challenged in court and only one survived unscathed: a standard issued in 1978 aimed at exposure to acrylonitrile, a chemical used in rubber manufacturing.
WHO OPPOSES THE RULE AND WHY?
A group of 24 Republican attorneys general warned in September that they would go to court to fight what they said was an illegal mandate.
They argued OSHA's power to issue an emergency rule was limited to workplace hazards such as industrial chemicals, not a widely circulating virus. They also accused the Biden administration of usurping the power to regulate healthcare which has traditionally been left to states. 
Industry, religious and civil liberty groups have also said they plan to sue because they expect the rule to be a burden on businesses or amount to an unconstitutional power grab. 
WHAT CAN OPPONENTS CHALLENGE?
The most likely avenue of attack will focus on the argument that there is a grave danger.
Opponents note that COVID-19 cases are declining from a recent wave in September and the country is getting closer to herd immunity.
The National Retail Federation wrote to the Biden administration in October questioning whether OSHA should be issuing a rule to address a disease that is a greater danger outside the workplace than in.
Courts have said OSHA must show there are no other means of addressing the grave danger. Trade groups have said mitigation efforts in low-risk industries such as construction have reduced the threat from the pandemic.
The ETS issued in June by OSHA that applied to healthcare settings could also be used against the agency. OSHA said then that it did not need a broader rule to apply across the economy.
WHAT HAVE COURTS SAID IN THE PAST ABOUT ETS?
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1978 standard on acrylonitrile because a study showed exposure to the chemical led to higher cancer rates among South Carolina workers, according to a report by the Fisher Phillips law firm.
Other emergency standards were struck down when OSHA failed to show a link to cancer from a targeted chemical or that the alleged hazard caused no more than headaches and fatigue, which a court found fell short of the grave danger threshold. 
WILL THE RULE CONFLICT WITH STATE LAWS?
Some states such as Texas and Montana have laws that ban COVID-19 vaccine mandates by private employers or prevent private employers from asking about a worker's vaccination status.
OSHA said the federal rule takes precedence over conflicting state laws.

OSHA regulates workplaces in 29 states while the rest have their own state-run version of the agency. There is some doubt whether all the state-run agencies will implement the rule. 
State-run OSHA agencies in Utah, Arizona and South Carolina were warned by Biden administration last month for failing to adopt the similar emergency rule unveiled by OSHA in June that applied to healthcare settings.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 12:12PM ET</span>",Auto parts maker Aptiv expects production to be affected by supply chain woes,"By Joseph White and Nathan Gomes
(Reuters) - Auto parts supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc is bracing for another year of disruption for global vehicle production that will test the company's efforts to deploy people and technology to make its sprawling supply chain less vulnerable.
The company reported a 70% fall in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hit by $55 million in costs related to semiconductor shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic, and a 5% drop in overall revenue due to lower vehicle production. 
Chief Executive Kevin Clark said Aptiv, whose customers include General Motors (NYSE:GM), expects the auto industry ""will not return to pre-pandemic production levels until post-2022"". The company did not give a forecast for 2022 performance.
It expects costs related to supply chain disruptions and the pandemic will total $310 million by the end of this year. 
To manage through supply chain turbulence, the maker of automated driving systems and electric vehicle wiring is leaning on a central ""supply chain resiliency team"" that monitors information from up to 4,000 suppliers. It has built a virtual, digital twin of its global supply chain to anticipate problems, and launched 100 projects to redesign products so they are not vulnerable to a shutdown by a single supplier, Clark said.
Aptiv began a more focused effort to identify its suppliers and create a digital map of its supply chain three or four years ago in response to global trade tensions, Clark said in an interview. 
'BRUTE FORCE'
Earlier this year, the company's supply chain crisis teams and technology were tested when a winter storm shut down petrochemical production in Texas.
""We apply a lot of brute force"" to solving supply disruptions, Clark said.
Aptiv receives more than 2 million parts every day from 4,000 suppliers, he said. Those components go to 125 Aptiv factories that in turn ship parts to more than 5,000 customer locations. Sensors and scanners allow Aptiv to monitor activity through its production system.
To head off future supply chain shocks, semiconductor manufacturers want auto manufacturers to share longer-term production plans, and stick to production volume commitments. 
""Predictability of production is extremely important,"" Clark told analysts, adding that Aptiv plans to have ""deeper relationships"" with fewer key semiconductor suppliers.
Looking ahead to 2022, Clark said there remained a lot of uncertainty, despite signs of stabilization in semiconductor production. An upsurge in COVID-19, bad weather or a natural disaster could have an outsized impact, he said. ""There's no extra inventory in the system.""
Aptiv posted net income of $86 million, or 32 cents per share, for the quarter, from $283 million, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company reported a profit of 38 cents per share, marginally above analyst expectations of 37 cents per share. Net sales fell marginally to $3.65 billion, above estimates of $3.50 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Chief Executive Scott Wine said while demand remained robust the company was currently seeing worsening component availability issues that were affecting many of its product lines.
""We are aggressively working to mitigate the situation and expect improvements throughout this quarter and limited impact on 2022,"" Wine told analysts after the group trimmed its full year forecasts despite strong third quarter data.
The maker of farm machinery, construction equipment, Iveco commercial vehicles and powertrains, said its 2021 revenues were now seen at the lower end of the range it provided three months ago, indicating a rise of between 24-28%.
Chief Financial Officer Oddone Incisa told analysts that the impact of component shortages should peak in this quarter, while some raw material prices were expected to stay high for longer and freight costs to diminish only at the end of 2022. 
Milan-listed shares in CNH Industrial fell after its results were released but later recovered and were flat by 1556 GMT. Early in the session they hit an all-time high of 15.58 euros. 
CNH also slightly trimmed its free cash flow forecast for the year to around $1.0 billion, while supply chain disruptions contributed to a $700 million cash burn in the third quarter, it said. 
The group last month announced temporary shutdowns of plants in Europe due to disruptions in procurements and a shortage of core components, especially semiconductors, and on Thursday it said it did not rule out that additional closures might occur.
In the July-September period the group's adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of industrial activities almost doubled, led by strong demand for agricultural machinery. They stood at $469 million, topping a $437 million forecast in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters.
Orders more than doubled year on year in the quarter both for tractors, in all regions, and for combines, especially in North America and Europe, CNH said. 
As it prepares to spin off, under the Iveco Group name, its lower-margin truck, bus and engine operations, CNH earlier this year announced the $2.1 billion purchase of U.S.-based Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Industries to bolster its in advanced areas of precision agriculture and autonomy.
Wine said on Thursday he was confident the deal would be finalised later this month.

Earlier this week CNH announced it had entered into a licensing agreement for electrification technologies with Monarch Tractor, a U.S company focused on fully-electric autonomous tractors.
The CEO confirmed CNH was on track to complete the spin off plan early in the first quarter of next year.

(Reuters) -Kellogg Co on Thursday warned a workers' strike at its U.S. cereal plants could dent annual profit as the Froot Loops maker braces for an end-of-year period likely to be impaired by supply issues.
A workers' union on Wednesday rejected a revised offer on pay and benefits from the U.S. packaged foods maker, extending a month-long strike of about 1,400 workers across its four cereal plants.
While Kellogg (NYSE:K) has been able to bring in temporary hires, the plants are not operating at full capacity, raising concerns among analysts that supplies of some of America's popular cereals could be constrained in the coming months.
""(Union members) are not willing (to) take any major concessions that Kellogg is proposing during a time of economic growth,"" Dan Osborn, president of the local union in Omaha, said on Thursday. Kellogg has pushed back against those claims.
It ""might get worse if (the) strike drags on"",  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Moskow said. 
Cereals accounted for around 40% of Kellogg's net sales last year.
""We have one particular area that is more challenging than others, and that's our cereal business, and that's obviously being compounded because of the strike,"" Chief Executive Steve Cahillane said on an earnings call.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",Investors seek deep value in 'too cheap' telecom shares,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Some investors are scooping up shares of beaten-down telecommunication network stocks, betting that companies like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon offer value despite cutthroat competition and muted prospects for revenue growth.
While the S&P 500 is up 24.6% so far this year, the three major U.S. telecom stocks have been going in the opposite direction. AT&Tshares are off nearly 13% in 2021 and near their lowest level in more than a decade.  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) shares have fallen about 10%, while smaller rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is off around 9%.
Telecom companies are often seen as a bastion for conservative investors because of their comparatively high dividends and they sometimes enjoy “safe-haven” status during periods of market volatility. 
In recent months, however, brutal competition within the sector has led many investors to doubt the operators' growth and profit prospects as they ramp up efforts to attract subscribers by paying for new phones and offering to pay outstanding bills for customers switching over from rivals. 
A decline in AT&T shares accelerated earlier this year after it announced a deal to combine content with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc to form a standalone global entertainment and media business.
As part of that deal, the company said it planned to cut the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, potentially denting its appeal to investors favoring telecom shares for their rich payouts. 
Big gains in faster-growing companies in technology, energy and other high-flying parts of the market, meanwhile, have also made poorly performing telecom stocks less-appealing to some investors.
With other sectors of the market soaring, “it hasn't paid to be conservative,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management.
Compounding the sector's troubles, U.S. regulators have been running an auction for wireless airwaves licenses, highlighting the massive capital required to keep boosting network capacity. 
Still, some see the sector as an opportunity to buy on the cheap, albeit one that will likely take a while to play out. 
AT&T and Verizon for instance, trade at 7.8 and 9.8 times forward earnings expectations, compared with a multiple of 21.1 for the S&P 500, according to the latest data from Refinitiv.
While telecoms typically underperform the broader S&P, their current valuations are below their own 10-year average, which is 11.7 for AT&T and 12.9 for Verizon.
Although a host of issues surrounds the industry, ""when you look at the valuation of the stocks relative to those issues, it seems to me that the market is way over-reacting,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities, who has purchased Verizon and AT&T shares as recently as October.
Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company, started buying AT&T shares early this year despite competition concerns, as they were ""frankly, too cheap.""
As a positive catalyst, Stone is eyeing AT&T's plan to spin off media assets next year in its venture with Discovery, which will be 71% owned by AT&T shareholders and 29% owned by Discovery investors. 
He is hoping the separation of operations such as HBO means AT&T will refocus on telecommunications and eventually lead the company to boost its dividend.
""A lot of bad news is built in there. I don't need a lot of things to go right for this to work out,"" he said.
T-Mobile US Inc on Tuesday raised its 2021 guidance across the board and posted third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates, boosting its shares. 
AT&T posted higher quarterly revenue in its late October earnings report, while Verizon raised its annual earnings forecast. 
Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, has been buying AT&T shares since March 2020 and is adding the stock to new accounts this year, betting that the company will eventually benefit from its Discovery deal.

Read on.According to a FactSet report, more S&P 500 companies are beating EPS estimates for the third quarter than on average, and beating EPS estimates by a wider margin than on average. However, high inflation continues to worry investors. Against his backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they tend to be relatively stable amid market volatility.
Investors' interest in REITs is evident in the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLRE) 8.3% gains over the past month and 14.4% returns over the past six months.

But the good news was that it didn't grind to a halt. But if economic growth is slowing, is that a concern for the S&P 500 (SPY) as less productivity could lead to lower profit margins? The answer is no, and I will tell you why and more below in this week's market commentary.(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published November 03, 2021 from the POWR Value newsletter).
One of the first concerns I had in March of 2020 when the proverbial ""…."" hit the fan was that the GDP growth was about to fall off a cliff. And it pretty much did. In the first quarter of 2020, GDP fell 5.1% from the previous quarter. Then in the second quarter, it fell another 31.2% from the first quarter. Things looked dire.
But then things were looking up for the third quarter of last year as cases started to fall in the summer and more people were out and about. In fact, GDP rose 33.8% in the third quarter.

Investing.com – Etsy stock (NASDAQ:ETSY) soared more than 14% Thursday as the online place for craft and vintage items reported third-quarter sales and profit that were ahead of estimates.
Even as the platform company suggested growth will be hard to sustain, traders chose to look at the momentum it carried in the third quarter. Chief Executive Officer Josh Silverman said buyers who had “found’ it during the pandemic are “sticking with us.""
Gross merchandise sales, the total value of goods sold on the company’s marketplaces, increased 18% to $3.1 billion. Growth in non-mask GMS (NYSE:GMS) was even higher, at 24%. GMS per active buyer jumped more than 20%, to $132, in July through September.
Etsy said active sellers rose to 7.46 million while active buyers jumped to about 96 million.
Supply chain issues and labor and material shortages seemed to have left little impact on the company, unlike the blow they dealt to other retailers, offline or online.
The company is now guiding for GMS of $4 billion at the midpoint in the ongoing quarter, up 12% on-year. Revenue is projected to come in at $675 million, 10% more than last time’s quarter.   
According to Silverman, the company is now moving in a different direction, straddling the commoditized marketplaces -- for the Etsy marketplace -- as well as its full ‘House of Brands’ — Reverb, Depop, and Elo7.
Etsy acquired Gen-Z thrift app Depop for $1.6 billion and Elo7, a Brazilian-based marketplace, for $217 million, both deals happening in July. The former is the 10th-most visited shopping site among Gen Z in the U.S., Etsy said at the time of the deal.
Depop and Elo7 will run as independent brands along with Reverb, the company’s online music marketplace.

(Reuters) -Cigna Corp on Thursday joined rival U.S. health insurers in signaling a lower hit from costs related to COVID-19 next year and maintained its target of at least 10% earnings growth over a newly raised 2021 adjusted profit estimate. 
Shares were up about 2% in early trade.
Larger rivals UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Anthem also raised their 2021 adjusted profit view and forecast smaller pandemic impact next year as infections decline and more people get inoculated.
Cigna (NYSE:CI) moderately raised its outlook for 2021 adjusted profit from operations by 15 cents to at least $20.35 per share, including a negative impact from COVID-19. The company, however, did not specify how much the impact would be per share. 
""As time progresses, COVID-related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined. Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19,"" Cigna's Chief Financial Officer Brian Evanko said. 
Cigna had forecast a hit of about $2.50 per share to its 2021 adjusted earnings in August.
The company's decision to not quantify the impact indicates ""it was a material headwind in 2021 that should subside in 2022,"" Cowen analyst Gary Taylor said. 
Cigna reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit on the back of a near 13% jump in revenue from its health services unit that includes the pharmacy benefits management business.
However, its medical care ratio (MCR), the amount spent on medical claims versus income from premiums, worsened to 84.4% in the third quarter from 82.6% a year earlier, compared with an estimate of 83.93%, according to four analysts polled by Refinitiv. 

The company now expects 2021 MCR to be between 84.0% and 84.5%, up from its prior forecast of 83.0% to 84.0%.
Excluding special items, Cigna's income from operations was $5.73 per share, above analysts' estimate of $5.23 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had charged Trevor Milton for using social media to repeatedly mislead investors about the company's technology and capabilities, reaping ""tens of millions of dollars"" as a result of his misconduct.
Shares of Nikola, which also reported third quarter financial results, were up 13% at $14.38 in early trading.
The company said the settlement, which was yet to be approved by a vote of SEC commissioners, will be paid over two years.
The Phoenix, Arizona-based startup added that it intends to seek reimbursement from Milton for costs and damages in connection with these investigations.
A spokesperson for Milton was not immediately available to comment.
Milton had stepped down as Nikola's executive chairman last September, two weeks after short-seller Hindenburg Research labeled the company a ""fraud"" and said it made many misleading statements about its technology.
Subsequently, he was also criminally charged with defrauding investors by lying to them about the company's products and technology.
As the company works on closing this chapter, Nikola said it had started building pre-series trucks in its Coolidge, Arizona facility and still looks to deliver up to 25 trucks to dealers and customers by December 2021.

In September, Nikola had signed a deal with Germany's Bosch Group to build Bosch fuel-cell power modules at its facility in Coolidge for two of its trucks powered by hydrogen fuel-cells.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Senior executives at Canada's two biggest life insurers said on Thursday they were bracing for more COVID-19 related uncertainties in their fastest-growing market of Asia after a resurgence of the virus and lockdowns in the region weighed on their quarterly earnings.
Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) Corp and Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF) Inc have been targeting expansion in the region, which has been their growth engine in many past quarters. But waves of COVID-19 that have hit different countries at different times and repeated lockdowns have increased claims and weighed on business growth.
""What we have experienced in Asia from time to time is that there is the resurgence of COVID and the containment measures do come back and have an impact on volumes,"" Anil Wadhwani, chief executive of Manulife's Asian business, said on an analyst call on Thursday. ""We don't believe that the recovery is going to be immediate."" 
Manulife's core profit from Asia fell almost 5% due to pandemic-related challenges in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, but growth in asset management and Canada earnings helped drive a 4.5% increase in company-wide profit. 
Smaller rival Sun Life paid out almost C$87 million ($70 million) in total claims related to COVID-19 this quarter, bringing payments since the pandemic began to about C$700 million, Sun Life's Chief Executive Kevin Strain told Reuters.
Death claims related to COVID-19 in Indonesia, the Philippines and India contributed to a 12% reduction in underlying earnings for Asia in the third quarter from a year earlier for Sun Life. 
Its U.S. business also came under some pressure from the pandemic, with the three months through September the worst for death claims related to COVID-19 for working-age people, Strain said. 
Underlying profit overall rose 7% thanks to strength in its asset management unit, and the company raised its medium-term return on equity target to over 16% from the current 12-14%.
""It's hard to tell whether there's going to be new variants,"" Strain said in an interview, referring to the virus. ""What you are seeing in Asia is higher vaccination rates. That should help in terms of claims, but I don't think we're out of COVID yet.""

Sun Life shares fell 0.8% to C$70.80 in morning trading in Toronto. Manulife shares dropped 2.6% to C$24.36. The Toronto stock benchmark added 0.5%.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Dozens of top executives at UBS will lose their exalted rank of group managing director in a drive by Chief Executive Ralph Hamers to streamline the Swiss bank's management.
UBS will do away with all ranks above managing director, reducing the number of hierarchical layers at Switzerland's largest bank to six from seven, an internal memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the bank said.
Hamers, a Dutchman who formerly led ING Group (NYSE:ING), has made simplification and efficiency a hallmark at UBS since last year becoming CEO of the world's biggest wealth manager. 
""To help streamline decision-making and reduce hierarchy, we are simplifying our corporate rank structure,"" the memo, titled ""Simplicity starts at the top"", said.
""As of 1 January 2022, all corporate ranks above Managing Director will be discontinued and instead be included in the Managing Director rank,"" it added.
A source familiar with the matter said that around 115 people are affected by the move, adding that terms and conditions of their compensation packages will not change.
""The business, functional or regional leadership titles of our most senior leaders as well as their roles and responsibilities remain unchanged,"" the memo said.
UBS last week posted its highest quarterly profit since 2015 as robust trading activity by the world's ultra wealthy led to a 23% surge in fee income.
When reporting third-quarter results, Hamers mentioned the need to organise UBS teams around client needs. He said UBS had cut up to two management layers in parts of its Swiss business.

UBS employees raked in higher bonuses in 2020, as bumper profits during the COVID-19 pandemic saw group-wide bonuses rise by 24% to $3.3 billion during the year.
Executives collected total compensation of 115.9 million Swiss francs in 2020, up from 102.1 million francs for the year before the pandemic, the Swiss bank's annual report showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Nintendo Co Ltd on Thursday cut its full year  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) sales forecast by 6% and said it is struggling to meet demand in the key year-end shopping season as chip shortages disrupt production of the hit device. 
While many companies have warned of the risks posed by the global semiconductor shortage, most have stopped short of cutting targets.  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp was also an exception on Thursday, cutting its vehicles sales outlook https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-second-quarter-quarterly-profit-climbs-2021-11-04 for the year to end-March.
""We can't produce enough to meet the demand we are expecting during the upcoming holiday season,"" Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told a news briefing as the Kyoto-based company revised down its Switch sales target to 24 million units. 
""Currently there is no sign of improvement and the situation continues to be severe so I can't say how long it will continue,"" he said. 
Second-quarter operating profit tumbled 32% from the same period a year earlier to 100 billion yen ($880 million), but the gaming firm lifted its annual forecast 4% to 520 billion yen, helped by a weaker yen. 
Sales of the Switch device - now in its fifth year on the market - slumped by a third to 8.28 million units in the six months to end September from the same period a year earlier. 
There was a smaller year-on-year decline in software sales and Nintendo raised its full year software forecast by 5% to 200 million units. It commonly raises targets widely seen as conservative during the financial year.
""That is with a weakening corona effect and without an epic blockbuster like ""Animal Crossing"" this time around,"" said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy, referring to the boost from stay-at-home gaming during the pandemic. 
With console gaming a cyclical business and Nintendo highly dependent on a single system, the timing of peak Switch sales is the focus of intense debate among investors and analysts.
Nintendo launched the $349.99 Switch OLED model on Oct. 8 but it remains in short supply in many markets.
Early data shows the improved model giving sales a bump. However, some observers worry that many buyers are likely upgraders rather than new customers, diminishing the potential bounce for software sales.
""Our main concern is still a lackluster game pipeline combined with a sharply declining tie-ratio that is likely to drive earnings lower,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal, who has downgraded Nintendo to underperform, wrote ahead of earnings. 
The tie-ratio is a closely watched indicator that refers to the amount of software bought by hardware owners. 
Nintendo continues to line up high profile releases for the system, with ""Pokemon"" remakes launching later his month and a new title, ""Pokemon Legends: Arceus"", going on sale in January. 

Nintendo shares closed down 1.7% ahead of earnings and have lost 25% this year.

The criticism against the company, posted online in August, questioned the scientific integrity of the company.
The peer-reviewed article was co-authored by scientists and academic collaborators for Cassava Sciences and is foundational to simufilam, the company’s lead drug candidate for treating Alzheimer’s disease.
Disputing the validity of Cassava’s clinical biomarker data and the integrity of Western Blot Analysis, a ‘statement of concern’ was posted requesting the Food and Drug Administration to halt the current clinical study of simufilam.
Cassava said the biomarker data of Alzheimer’s patients was generated by  Quanterix  (NASDAQ:QTRX), an independent company, and presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.
The company said Western Blot Analysis is foundational to the biotechnology industry and is a standard lab technique used worldwide to detect a protein of interest.

(Reuters) - ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc on Thursday posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by more subscriber additions to its fast-growing streaming platforms and strong advertising sales.
The company added 4.3 million global streaming subscribers in the quarter, led by Paramount+, bringing the total to nearly 47 million. Content including ""A Quiet Place Part II"", ""Paw Patrol: The Movie"", the return of the NFL, and the new CBS fall television season contributed to that growth.
A large part of the media giant's business was buoyed by a rebound in ad-spending, driven by the resumption of live sports.
That, coupled with viewers flocking to the company's diverse cable and streaming network that includes PlutoTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, Showtime and Paramount+ has bumped up subscription additions. 
With people now stepping out seeking in-person entertainment and increased pressure on traditional pay-TV services, media companies across the industry are looking to bolster their streaming services to take on giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+. Bundling services together through commercial partnerships is one option.
U.S wireless carrier T-Mobile said on Thursday customers who pay a monthly bill and home internet plan subscribers would get Paramount+ Essential (which does not include local live CBS station coverage) free for a year.
Revenue rose 13% to $6.61 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had expected $6.57 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
ViacomCBS' streaming revenue rose 62% during the quarter to about $1.1 billion.

On a call with investors the company said it expects fourth-quarter streaming expenses, including content and marketing, to rise $350 million relative to third-quarter streaming costs.

And although the Federal Reserve’s decision to commence bond tapering and rising inflation could foster significant market volatility in the near term, we think it could be worth adding last month’s best-performing S&P 500 stocks—Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA),  Union Pacific  (UNP), Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), and Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)—to one’s watchlist. Let’s examine these names.After witnessing one of the worst monthly performances in September (down 5%), the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), which is widely seen as the best representation of the broader market, gained nearly 7% in October--highest one-month gain since November 2020--closing at a $459.25 all-time high. Factors like Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine’s approval for use in children aged 5 -12, impressive third-quarter earnings releases, declining jobless claims, and the possibility that President Biden’s infrastructure bill may become law have all helped SPY and other benchmark indexes to hit fresh highs in October.
An expected increase in consumer spending ahead of the holiday season could aid the performance of the major indexes this month and in December also. However, factors such as the continued spread of COVID-19 , rising inflation, supply chain logjams, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to taper its bond-buying program raise concerns over a potential market correction in the near term.
Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH), and Teradyne, Inc. (TER) were the best-performing S&P 500 stocks last month, so we think it could be wise to add them to one’s watchlist.

A forecast for revenue between $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the current quarter is lower both from the prior quarter and the same quarter last year. It came in even as the company’s second-quarter sales and profit topped estimates.
Qorvo blamed the ongoing supply challenges and other factors affecting global smartphone demand, which would in turn hurt demand for its products that go into those devices. Qorvo’s products and technologies also feed space equipment, radar, power management systems and others.
Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy said the challenges could moderate in the March quarter. The company expects full-year revenue to grow 15% and to deliver gross margin over 52%.

GLASGOW (Reuters) - Dutch lender ING will not finance the trading of oil and gas in Peru amid concern about the impact of the industry on indigenous people in the Sacred Headwaters region of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a policy document seen by Reuters showed.
The move marks an expansion of its policy after it stopped similar financing in Ecuador earlier this year alongside peers including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), after pressure from campaigners.
Scientists see conserving the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, as critical to staving off catastrophic climate change because of the vast amount of greenhouse gas it absorbs. Yet the forest is rapidly being destroyed, with devastating consequences for climate and biodiversity.
The role of European lenders in backing the trade from the Amazon came under scrutiny in August 2020 after a report by advocacy groups Stand.earth and Amazon Watch looking at oil exports from the region to the United States.
ING's move comes as policymakers meet in Scotland for global climate talks, aiming to accelerate action to cap global warming, a key plank of which included fresh steps to protect the world's forests.
While ING did not directly finance oil and gas exploration and production in the country, it had previously financed those who move it out of the region.
""Indigenous people living in the Sacred Headwaters of the Amazon in Ecuador and Peru have called on banks to stop financing oil development in the region, as it poses a threat to them and the surrounding ecosystem,"" the updated policy said.
""We have financed the trading of oil from the region, but decided in the beginning of 2021 not to enter into new contracts for exports from Ecuador and decided in November 2021 not to enter into contracts for exports from Peru.""
A spokesman for ING told Reuters it had updated its policy, available on its website, on Nov. 3. But he declined to give details about the bank's financial exposure in the region. 
Peru is the Amazon nation with the second-highest amount of deforestation for this year as of mid-September, trailing behind much larger Brazil, according to non-profit Amazon Conservation.
From 2002-2019, a total of 19,700 square kilometres (7,600 square miles) of the Peruvian Amazon was destroyed, an area more than 12 times the size of London.

Stand.earth's Tyson Miller welcomed the bank's move, and hoped it would lead to more such exclusion policies in the run-up to the second round of global talks on biodiversity next year.
He urged companies to introduce even broader Amazon exclusion policies that covered all activities that contribute to deforestation, such as illegal logging to clear land for agriculture.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 09:51AM ET</span>","Chinese developer Kaisa unit misses payment, debt worries mount","By David Kirton, Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
SHENZHEN, China/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd said on Thursday its finance unit had missed a payment on a wealth management product (WMP), adding to worries about a cash crunch at the debt-strapped company.
Kaisa's troubles come amid concerns about a deepening liquidity crisis in the Chinese property sector, with a string of offshore debt defaults, credit rating downgrades, and sell offs in the developers' shares and bonds in recent weeks. 
The Shenzhen-based developer, which provides a guarantee for the wealth management product, said in a statement it is facing unprecedented liquidity pressure due to a challenging property market and rating downgrades. 
It said it was raising funds to ease the pressure by measures including speeding up asset sales. It is ranked as the 25th largest developer in the country by home sales.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt coming due over the next year of any Chinese developer after embattled China Evergrande Group, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities.
The worsening health of China's $5 trillion property sector, a major economic growth driver, is testing Beijing's resolve to press on with painful structural reforms such as reducing high debt levels in the sector.
Shenzhen regulators will hold a meeting on Friday to discuss liquidity issues at Kaisa and its peer Fantasia, local media Cailianshe reported. Fantasia had defaulted on an offshore bond tranche last month.
Fantasia and Kaisa declined to comment. The Shenzhen central sub-branch of People's Bank of China (PBOC) could not be reached for comment. 
Kaisa senior management including group chairman Kwok Ying Ching spoke to WMP investors in a meeting on Thursday, the developer's statement said, to discuss payment solutions.
Two investors told Reuters that Kaisa said during the meeting it has a total outstanding 12.79 billion yuan ($2.00 billion) in principal and interest, and it plans to pay it back gradually. But investors have pushed back strongly, they added.
Kaisa did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about its repayment plan.
GRADUAL REPAYMENT
Kaisa, in common with other heavily-indebted Chinese property developers and conglomerates, issues high-yielding WMPs to mostly mom-and-pop investors - a popular way of borrowing that sidesteps stringent government lending restrictions. 
Evergrande's wealth arm, which raised more than 100 billion yuan in the past five years, missed its payments earlier this year, leading to protests by investors in several cities in September who feared they will never get their money back.
Hong Kong-listed shares of Kaisa, which has a market value of about $1 billion, plunged more than 15% on Thursday to an all-time low. Its December 2021 6.5% dollar bond slumped more than 17% to 51.5 cents, yielding over 1,000%, according to Marketaxxess.
Kaisa has around $3.2 billion in offshore senior notes due in the next 12 months, with the next maturity worth $400 million falling on Dec. 7. It has coupon payments totalling over $59 million due on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.
Kaisa Finance's headquarters was nearly empty on Thursday morning, with several police vehicles stationed outside the building. 
Reuters reported last week that Kaisa is seeking buyers for its Hong Kong-listed property management unit, Kaisa Prosperity Holdings Ltd and two residential sites in the city.
Evergrande narrowly averted a default for the second time last week, but faces another hard deadline on Nov. 10 for more than $148 million in coupon payments that had been due on Oct. 11.
Its unit Scenery Journey has coupon payments totalling more than $82 million due Nov. 6, though the bonds' terms grant a 30-day grace period on such payments.
LIQUIDITY CRUNCH 
Separately, smaller player Yango Group, which is seeking to exchange its dollar bonds to help avoid a default, said it has reached an agreement with investors in China to extend principal payments on asset-backed securities.
Shanghai Shimao Co said it will limit investor participation in seven Shanghai-traded bonds starting Friday. It added it sees no major events that seriously harm its repayment ability.
Investor concerns about the broadening impact of the liquidity crunch sparked heavy selling of other Chinese developers' bonds in onshore markets on Thursday. 

Exchange-traded bonds of onshore units of developers Yuzhou Group and Shimao Group plunged more than 20%, triggering trading halts. Refinitiv data showed dollar bonds from Ronshine China Holdings, Zhenro Properties Group and Guangzhou R&F falling more than 10%.

1564,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mixed as Rally Runs Out of Steam; Dow Down 50 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Thursday, unable to add much to Wednesday's gains that left them at a record high for the third straight day, despite the tailwinds of a relaxed Federal Reserve and a strengthening labor market.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52 points, or 0.2% at 36,104 points. The S&P 500 was up a little less than 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that initial jobless claims fell to a new post-pandemic low at 269,000 last week. They're now running at a level that would have been exceptionally low at pretty much any time in recent history except for the presidency of Donald Trump. Other data also signaled no end to strong domestic demand ahead of the holiday season, with imports rising to a new record high of $288.5 billion in September.
The jobless claims data, along with Wednesday's strong ADP private nonfarm payrolls report, suggest that official employment data on Friday will show a clear re-acceleration in October, after falling to their lowest level in eight months in September. Analysts expect nonfarm jobs to have grown by 450,000 through the middle of last month.
Of more concern were other data, which showed unit labor costs rising 8.3% in the third quarter and productivity falling by 5.0%. Those point to a hardening of inflationary pressures that may yet cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than it currently wants to.
Among individual movers, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock caught the eye with a 12% gain after reporting record fiscal fourth-quarter sales that underlined its pricing power with key customer segments, such as smartphone makers and the automotive sector. The numbers also helped Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rise 5.5% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock rise 1.5%
By contrast,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock slumped 16% to a four-month low after revising down its estimates for group sales this year, which consist overwhelmingly of its Covid-19 vaccine. That was a sharp contrast with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) which bumped its forecasts for vaccine sales higher earlier in the week. Moderna is struggling to ramp up production of its vaccine. 
Also perhaps weighing on sentiment was the approval in the U.K. of Merck's antiviral Covid-19 pill. While that's not conceived as an alternative to vaccination, it does point to alternative strategies for containing the disease by national health care systems. Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock rose 1.2% to a new all-time high. It's risen nearly 25% in the seven weeks since announcing the pill's effectiveness. The news hit rival vaccine makers, taking 7.0% off BioNTech  (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock and 5.6% off  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock.
Elsewhere, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock rose 12% as investors warmed to the idea that the crafts-based e-commerce site could be a big winner this holiday season, due to its reliance on sellers who work largely from home in North America, rather than at the end of supply chains thousands of miles away. Its stock had fallen slightly in after-hours trading on Thursday after it announced mildly disappointing numbers for the quarter through September.

The shares soared the most in eight months.
Net income at Turkey’s flagship carrier was 6.3 billion liras ($563 million), according to a statement on Thursday, 35% higher than the top of a range of analyst estimates. That compared with a loss of 946 million liras in 2020, when much of global travel was grounded due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The results are the latest sign that the aviation industry is recovering quickly from the coronavirus crisis, with both  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) and Air France-KLM reporting healthy figures and outlook in recent days. The dropping of border restrictions by most governments outside Asia has led to a surge in pent-up demand, while the opening of key transatlantic routes starting next week is expected to give another boost. 
Turkish Airlines is among carriers to have taken advantage of a booming freight business even while passenger travel has been subdued. The company is looking to spin off its cargo operations into a separate unit to unlock value for investors and to have a more efficient management.
Cuts in staff expenses to below 2019 levels due to salary reductions and the depreciation of the Turkish lira also buoyed the earnings, the company said.
Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) rose as much as 8.1%, the sharpest intraday gain since March 2, to 16.84 liras, the highest in almost three years.
The carrier’s results showed a “positive surprise in its unit costs, driven mainly by lower personnel expenses, which looks more sustainable than our initial expectations,” Gorkem Goker, an analyst at Istanbul-based brokerage Yapi Kredi Yatirim, said in an emailed note. He raised his recommendation on the stock to buy from hold.
“We also welcome the strength in the company’s cargo business, whose outlook is the foremost exciting part of Turkish Airlines’ near-term story,” he said. That performance “eases our concerns for the weakness in passenger front.” 
The airline serves one of the largest networks in the world with 333 destinations in 128 countries.

(Reuters) - Metro Bank said it has received a takeover approach from U.S. private equity firm Carlyle, sending its battered shares by as much as 31% higher, in a sign of growing interest in Britain's mid-sized banks.
Metro Bank, which had a market capitalisation of 178 million pounds ($242 million) at Wednesday's closing price, said it was engaging with Carlyle.
But it added in a statement there was no certainty an offer would be made and advised its shareholders to take no action.
Shares in Metro Bank, which have slumped around 57% since February 2020 as they and other mid-sized lenders struggled with low interest rates and competition, were up 29% at 1125 GMT and heading for their best ever one-day performance. 
Metro Bank has been working to turn around its fortunes after a major accounting error in 2019 forced out its top bosses and led to a significant share price fall.
Dealmaking involving British banking has picked up recently, with Co-operative Bank making an unsolicited offer for TSB, the British subsidiary of Sabadell. The Spanish bank rejected the bid for TSB last month. 
Metro Bank, which was launched more than a decade ago to challenge Britain's incumbent high street lenders, has struggled to generate profits from a growing deposit base.
But its losses narrowed in July as Britain's economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had left smaller banks more vulnerable compared with their larger and more diverse rivals as interest rates hit record lows. 
""A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate,"" Metro Bank said. 

A spokesperson for Carlyle declined to comment.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) SA said on Thursday it swung to a net profit in the third quarter from a year-earlier loss thanks to the performance of its foreign units, though rising energy costs hit profitability in its domestic market.
The company reported a net profit of 706 million euros ($818 million) in the third quarter compared with a 160 million loss in the same period a year ago, following a 785 million euro write-down of assets in Argentina.
While business was brisk in Germany and in Latin America, core profit in Spain during the quarter fell 8.9% from the previous year. 
That was due mainly to rising energy costs and higher costs from sports content after right holders gave a rebate in 2020 because of the pandemic, the company said. Shares were down 2.3% in midday trading, making them the worst performer on the IBEX 35 blue chip index. 
The higher energy costs in Spain will likely keep weighing on Telefonica's profitability for a few quarters ahead, Chief Operating Officer Angel Vila told analysts in a conference call on Thursday. 
The effect will ""fade away at some point next year"", he added, as prices will eventually ""regularize"" and the company will manage to gain efficiency, he told Reuters. He doesn't plan to transfer cost increases to customers.
Over the first nine months of the year, Telefonica booked a record 9.34 billion euro net profit, mainly because of capital gains made on the sale of its Telxius tower unit and the tie-up of its O2 unit and Virgin Media in Britain.
Overall revenue fell 11% in the third quarter from the same period a year ago as the company has become significantly smaller as a result of asset sales, but core earnings rose 40%.
""We maintained the momentum of year-on-year organic revenue and (core profit) growth for the second consecutive quarter,"" Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said in a statement.
Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected net profit of 568 million euros in the third quarter. 
Telefonica reiterated that it expects revenue and core profit to be ""stable"" or see ""slight growth"" in 2021, in line with an announcement last quarter.
Like European rivals, the company, Spain's largest telecom firm, has been facing growth issues aside from the impact of the pandemic, and has been selling assets to cut debt and fund an upgrade to next-generation 5G networks.

As a result of its asset disposal strategy, Telefonica managed to reduce its debt to 25 billion euros in September, 32% less than in September 2020. The company intends to get a debt level consistent with a ""solid"" investment grade, Chief Financial Officer Laura Abasolo said.

Tesla and Hertz did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Last week, Hertz said it placed an initial order of 100,000 Teslas. Interim Hertz Chief Executive Mark Fields told Reuters the order will primarily be Model 3 vehicles. The announcement, triggered a meteoric rally in the carmaker's stock helping the company surpass $1 trillion in market value.
However, Tesla boss Elon Musk took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday to say that his company had not signed a contract with Hertz, spurring a brief halt in Tesla's stock rally.
In response to Musk's comments, Hertz said in a statement that the deliveries of the Teslas had already started.
""We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles,"" Hertz said on Tuesday.

The company has already started advertising its Tesla fleet on websites and in a series of YouTube commercials featuring National Football League (NFL) quarterback Tom Brady.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 09:23AM ET</span>",Amazon takes another swipe at union as Alabama rematch looms,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Julia Love
(Reuters) - Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) handily defeated a historic union drive at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. But with the prospect of another vote looming, the online retailer is leaving nothing to chance.
Over the past few weeks, Amazon has ramped up its campaign at the warehouse, forcing thousands of employees to attend meetings, posting signs critical of labor groups in bathrooms, and flying in staff from the West Coast, according to interviews and documents seen by Reuters.
It is an indication that Amazon is sticking to its aggressive playbook. In August, a U.S. National Labor Relations Board hearing officer said the company's conduct around the previous vote interfered with the Bessemer union election. An NLRB regional director's decision on whether to order a new vote is forthcoming. Amazon has denied wrongdoing and said it wanted employees' voices to be heard.
Still, the moves to discourage unionization ahead of any second election, previously unreported, show how Amazon is fighting representation at its U.S. worksites.
An uptick in labor activity since workers in April rejected joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), including organizing drives in New York and Canada, has pushed Amazon to react.
Other prominent unions like the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are also vowing to organize Amazon. The risk: unions could alter how Amazon manages its vast, finely tuned operation and drive up costs at a time when a labor shortage is taking a toll on its profit.
Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB chair, said the stakes are high. 
""They really, really fear any toe in the door to unionization,"" Liebman said. ""There's nothing like a win, and a win can be contagious.""
In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said a union ""will impact everyone at the site so it's important all employees understand what that means for them and their day-to-day life working at Amazon.""
In the new campaign, Amazon has dedicated a week of mandatory meetings to warn staff that unions will force them to strike and forgo pay, a nod to the recent stoppages roiling workplaces across the country.
And like last time, Amazon has said unions are a business taking workers' money and told staff to consider what it can guarantee and what unions cannot - now in panels in bathroom stalls and above urinals. The panels carry information unrelated to unions as well.
""Unions can make a lot of promises, but cannot guarantee you will receive better wages, benefits, or working conditions,"" read a photo shared with Reuters.
UNION SUPPORTERS PUSH BACK
Some staff have challenged Amazon's claims and posted their own pro-union signs in warehouse bathrooms, according to worker accounts.
The RWDSU, meanwhile, has flown in personnel to Bessemer, facilitated nightly chats at a burger joint, and ramped up door-knocking. Home visits are a crucial part of organizing drives because unions have no guaranteed worksite access under U.S. law, said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University.
Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU's president, said the union has heard from employees who now would change their vote to join. He said he believes door-knocking gives the union a new edge.
""We have a greater opportunity to engage with people every day than during the height of the pandemic,"" said Appelbaum. Organizers did not conduct home visits last time because of COVID-19 fears.
He added that the RWDSU's effort is about more than Amazon. ""It's about the future of work.""
A Teamsters spokeswoman said the union has attended strategy meetings on Amazon with other unions coordinated by the biggest U.S. labor federation, the AFL-CIO. Tim Schlittner of the AFL-CIO said the federation is ""bringing the resources of the labor movement"" to support Amazon workers.
Roadblocks abound, not least that the RWDSU has to reach new staff joining the company without knowing their names until an official election is ordered. Appelbaum estimated that Amazon was hiring 200 people a week in Bessemer.
Amazon had no comment on turnover. The warehouse headcount numbers more than 5,800.
SCARE TACTIC
On Oct. 10, just when Amazon raised hourly wages by 25 cents for more veteran staff, the company re-started mandatory weekly meetings in Bessemer to highlight different messages about unions. Amazon said the pay increase was unrelated to the meetings.
For Darryl Richardson, an outspoken union supporter at the facility, strikes were a bigger focus of Amazon's new campaign.
""They're trying to scare you more now,"" Richardson said. ""You don't get paid going on a strike.""
According to Richardson, Amazon falsely said a union would force workers to walk off the job and fine them if they crossed a picket line. The 52-year-old said Amazon has treated him differently as well: he was denied transfer requests, and an official walking through the warehouse to ask workers how they felt about unions had little to say after scanning Richardson's badge ... ""'You're Darryl,' she said. 'Your mind is made up.'""
Amazon had no comment on Richardson's remarks.
Though the company told employees they can turn away organizers showing up at their doorsteps, Richardson said he and peers have kept knocking, while Amazon is making its case on home turf.
In one table-top sign Amazon put up at the warehouse, the company exhorted workers to ""FOLLOW THE MONEY,"" claiming the RWDSU gave Appelbaum a ""$30,000 raise paid for by union dues"" and last year spent nearly $100,000 on cars for its officials.

Asked for comment, Appelbaum said he has no union car and that transportation is for field representatives whose jobs require travel to workplaces.
Amazon is ""misrepresenting the information,"" he said.

Puma, which is growing faster than rivals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), is putting a big focus on the U.S. market: it relaunched basketball products in 2018, opened a new flagship store in New York and invested in a new distribution centre.
""We're pretty bullish on the opportunities here in North America and we feel like we've emerged stronger through difficult times,"" Bob Philion, president of Puma's North America business, told Reuters.
The Americas is Puma's fastest-growing region this year, with sales up 31% in the third quarter to account for 37% of the total, helped by a shift to more casual dressing and more people taking up sport during the pandemic.
Puma officially opened its new North America headquarters in Somerville, Massachusetts, on Thursday. It includes a roof deck, a fitness centre and a room for visiting children, bringing together 450 employees from two separate offices.
The move was in the planning for four years but was delayed by six months as Puma made changes in response to the way the pandemic has shifted working practices.
Puma increased spacing and added partitions and touchless fixtures as well as created more rooms where people can join video calls with colleagues working remotely.
""I feel very fortunate to have a new home to welcome people back. People want to collaborate again,"" Philion said. ""What we've been lacking on Zoom calls and Teams calls is that collaboration, that energy, that creativity.""
Puma hopes the new facilities and a combination of office and remote work will help the company attract staff, with Philion noting it was tough to attract workers, particularly in distribution and retail.
""It's more competitive now than it's ever been. People through COVID are making some life decisions,"" he said.
""Flexibility is key. At the end of the day our employees understand that we're a product marketing company. We have tangible things that we touch and feel: shoes and apparel.""

Puma wants its staff to be in the office three days a week - although that will depend on teams. Meetings are only scheduled from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. to give people a chance to start earlier or later to avoid the rush hour.
""We don't want people sitting in traffic,"" Philion said.

(Reuters) -German chemicals group Evonik Industries on Thursday projected an upbeat view for 2022 after firming up 2021 core profit and sales guidance, citing improved business performance and higher pricing.
Evonik, whose products include chemicals for batteries and coolant lines of electric cars, derives almost one-fifth of its sales from the mechanical engineering and automotive industries, which have struggled to maintain production levels because of chip shortage this year.
Chief Executive Christian Kullmann, while speaking to analysts, named the automotive, animal feed and lipids businesses among potential growth drivers for the company next year.
""The underlying trend in automotive is strong,"" Kullmann told the conference call, adding that the company sees good potential for a strong rebound in the business in 2022, as he expects the logistical constraints to ease.
Kullmann said the prices of methionine, an animal feed ingredient Evonik produces, which have surged in recent weeks, would start to help the company's margin performance and price increases from the next month and would pay off in 2022.
He also said the company expected ""significantly"" higher sales of lipids, used in Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, next year versus 2021.
Evonik expects 2021 adjusted core profit of about 2.4 billion euros ($2.78 billion) and sales at 14.5 billion euros, both in the upper end of ranges the company had forecast at mid-year.
The Essen-based company also expects free cash flow to rise to about 1 billion euros in 2021, up from 780 million euros in 2020. Previously the company had said it expected an increase in free cash flow in 2021.
The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 645 million euros ($747.23 million) in the third quarter, up 24% and slightly above analysts' forecast of 641.1 million euros in a company-provided poll.
""We think Evonik reported good results. The previous weak spot of Evonik – the FCF generation (free cash flow generation) – seems to be managed far better than in the past,"" said Baader analyst Markus Mayer.
""(Evonik) is seeing impact of the raw material and supply chain related headwinds as EBITDA margin came in 140 basis points weaker than consensus,"" Citi's Mubasher Chaudhry said.
At 1229 GMT Evonik's shares were down 0.1%, with their year-to-date increase just below 7%.

Investing.com –  Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) slumped more than 16% on Thursday after the company made a sizeable cut to its guidance for sales of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine.
The company said vaccine sales would be between $15 billion and $18 billion in 2021, a large cut just three months after it claimed to have signed agreements for $20 billion in anticipated 2021 vaccine sales.
This compares with rival  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which raised its full-year forecast for Covid vaccine sales to $36 billion earlier this week.
Moderna also lowered its vaccine production forecast for the year to between 700 million and 800 million doses, at the full 100 microgram dose used for the initial two shots.
Moderna blamed longer delivery lead times for international shipments and exports that may shift deliveries to early 2022. The company said it is seeing a temporary impact from the expansion of bottling capacity, also known as fill/finish.
The cut in the sales forecast is also due to the prioritization of deliveries to low-income countries, many of which still lack access to the life-saving shot.
“We are working hard to ensure our vaccine is available in low-income countries with approximately 10% of our 2021 volume and significantly more of our 2022 volume going to low-income countries. . .,” Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said in a company statement.
The cut in guidance overshadowed word that the company’s board approved a share buyback of up to $1 billion spread over two years.
Moderna’s September-quarter revenue jumped more than 31 times to $4.97 billion as the company shipped millions of doses and remained at the forefront of action against the pandemic. Profit was $3.33 billion against a loss of $233 million in the same quarter last year. Despite that, both profit and sales were below estimates.

(Reuters) -Britain's largest sportswear retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports must sell Footasylum, a UK watchdog said on Thursday after a second investigation found the combination could leave consumers worse off even after considering stiff online competition amid the pandemic.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) started investigating JD's 86 million pound ($116.72 million) purchase of Footasylm in 2019 and ordered it to unwind the merger in May last year. JD successfully appealed that decision, with the regulator considering the impact of COVID-19 on shopping habits as it reassessed its findings.
However, the CMA said that the evidence it has analysed showed that the two companies are adapting well to market conditions and they would still thrive should the merger not go ahead.
""The pandemic may have altered the way we shop but innovative businesses, driven by healthy competition, will rise to the challenge and successfully cater to changing tastes and habits,"" CMA Chair of the inquiry group Kip Meek said in a statement on Thursday. 
JD Sports, which sells brands such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) and Puma in its physical and online stores, has argued the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased competition, as global brands expand their direct-to-consumer businesses.
JD Chairman Peter Cowgill said the regulator's decision on Thursday remains ""inexplicable"" to anyone who understood how the pandemic has affected UK retail.
""It is deeply troubling at a time when the UK high street has been seriously damaged already and is vulnerable to further closures,"" Cowgill added.
JD has six weeks to send to the CMA their promise to sell Footasylum, a process that the CMA will oversee, or the British regulator will put in place a legally enforceable order.

The retailer said it was studying the report in detail and would carefully consider its options. It has a four week window to appeal the decision if it wishes to do so.

FRANKFURT/HAMBURG (Reuters) -Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess sought to defuse a clash over the pace of reforms he thinks are needed to keep up with the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by addressing thousands of workers at the German carmaker's Wolfsburg plant on Thursday.
At the heart of the rift lies Diess' concerns that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) might fall behind rivals unless it accelerates an overhaul to compete with electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, and nimbler rivals in China. Workers, meanwhile, are concerned that means potentially huge job cuts. 
Sources said the rift between workers and management has rekindled a long-standing conflict that has even led to a discussion about Diess' future at a pivotal moment in the history of the world's second-largest carmaker.
""I'm being frequently asked why I keep comparing us with Tesla. I know this is annoying to some,"" Diess told workers.
""Even if I no longer talk about Elon Musk: he'll still be there and revolutionises our industry and keeps getting more competitive quickly.""
""Only as a team can we make Volkswagen future-proof,"" Diess told the meeting, also attended by works council boss Daniela Cavallo, Lower Saxony state premier Stephan Weil and Joerg Hofmann, the head of powerful trade union IG Metall.
The conflict highlights the limitations Diess faces in steering the behemoth that employs 675,000 staff and navigating a complex stakeholder structure, where labour representatives and the state of Lower Saxony have a majority on the supervisory board.
Sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday a specially convened committee would discuss the future of Diess in an attempt to solve the dispute.
Works council boss Cavallo criticised Diess for his communication style in recent weeks, which she said fuelled concerns the transformation he was proposing will result in tens of thousands of job cuts.
""We're tired of hearing time and again that the works council is apparently only concerned with preserving the status quo,"" she said, adding workers and labour representatives were all backing the needed overhaul.
Diess, in a supervisory board meeting in September, warned that as many as 30,000 jobs could be lost if Volkswagen was not fast enough in transforming itself, sources have said. He has said Tesla is much more efficient with its much smaller workforce.

Musk, who is currently awaiting the opening of Tesla's first European gigafactory in Gruenheide near Berlin, even dialled into a meeting of top level Volkswagen executives last month and talked to them for over an hour, Diess said last week.
""The fascination that you apparently feel for Mr Musk and the effort you're making in staying in contact with him - we would welcome if it was the same for the huge challenges the company currently faces,"" Cavallo said.

LONDON (Reuters) -BT heralded its progress in building Britain's biggest fibre broadband network on Thursday, saying lower costs and strong demand would underpin returns to investors, in its latest effort to keep a circling shareholder at bay.
Chief Executive Philip Jansen said such was the momentum in its rollout, BT had decided to fund the full expansion of fibre to 25 million premises by 2026 itself after it had explored bringing in a partner for 5 million homes and businesses.
""With FTTP (fibre to the premises) build costs coming down and take-up ahead of expectations, we think the best decision for shareholders is to retain 100% of the project and its returns,"" he told reporters.
The company, which is strengthening its defences against a possible takeover by European telecoms player Patrick Drahi, said it had lowered the cost of the build by 15%.
After BT passed the peak of its build, capex would reduce by at least 1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) and operating costs by 500 million pounds, increasing free cash flow by at least 1.5 billion pounds by the end of the decade, Jansen said.
Shares in BT, which have fallen 31% since June, were trading 7% higher on Thursday, after the company confirmed its outlook for this year and next and brought forward a 2 billion pound cost savings target by a year to 2024.
Britain's biggest broadband and mobile operator faces competition in the fibre race, with rival Virgin Media O2 planning to upgrade its entire 15.5 million premises network to by 2028. Virgin Media O2 is also talking to broadband providers about moving onto its network as wholesale customers.
Virgin Media O2, owned by Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) and Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA), reported a 0.7% rise in adjusted revenue for its third quarter, during which it added 38,000 fixed line customers.
Jansen said BT had signed up 10 providers, including TalkTalk and Sky, to its long-term FTTP pricing offer.
""We will offer keen pricing and compete hard on customer service to fill the platform and ensure the best return on our full fibre investments,"" he said. 
Investors are now awaiting any move by Drahi after he bought a 12.1% stake in BT in June. A pledge not to launch a takeover expires next month.
BT has appointed boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw to help its defence against a takeover, while it said on Monday it had delivered its 1 billion pound cost saving target 18 months ahead of schedule.
Jansen said he had good interactions with all shareholders. 
""We're not in the game of speculating,"" he said. ""We're just driving on with our agenda, which we know our shareholders really support.""
BT reported a 3% decline in revenue to 10.3 billion pounds ($14.07 billion) for the six months to end-September, in line with expectations, driven by drops in services to multinational companies and a flat performance in consumer.
Adjusted core earnings rose 1% to 3.75 billion pounds.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for ""green"" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.
Ultimately, the automaker aims to regain an investment grade rating for itself and Ford Credit, its captive financing arm, which in turn would lower the cost of future borrowing.
In a media briefing, Treasurer Dave Webb said the company is making a cash tender for ""covid bonds"" at 8% to 9.5% interest that it issued in April 2020, at the start of the global pandemic. 
Ford expects initially to offer a $1 billion green bond at 3.5% to 4% interest, to replace some of the high-coupon bonds and to supplement the zero-interest convertible debt it issued earlier this year.
Part of the money will help fund the automaker's ambitious plan to convert a significant portion of its global production from fossil-fueled combustion engine vehicles to battery-powered electric vehicles.
The company has said it plans to spend at least $30 billion through 2025 to design, engineer and manufacture a broad range of EVs in North America, China and Europe.
Ford is a leading seller of full-size pickup trucks and SUVs -- hugely profitable combustion engine vehicles that are still popular with U.S. customers.
A ""sustainable financing framework"" announced Thursday will provide Ford with access to new sources of capital, including investors supporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. 

New green bonds would enable Ford Credit to extend financing to customers with lower credit scores, but would not require them to buy electric or hybrid vehicles.
Thursday's announcement coincides with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland and the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement.

IBM made the move to prevent the long-term decline in margins at Kyndryl affect its valuation, and to make itself more of a pure play on Cloud-related services.
Revenue at the unit has fallen for years. Third-quarter revenue at Kyndryl fell around 5% to $6.15 billion. The separation will take between $2 billion and $3 billion off IBM's fourth-quarter consolidated revenue, Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said last month.

U.S. sales of the cocktail, REGEN-COV, approved for emergency use in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, were $676.7 million in the third quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $320.5 million.
The company also recorded additional revenue of $127 million from its collaboration with Roche, which sells the cocktail as Ronapreve outside the United States.
A sharp surge in COVID-19 cases led by the Delta variant caused a ""tremendous acceleration"" in use of the cocktail, Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer had said in August.
Regeneron delivered 300,000 doses of the 1.4 million additional doses that were ordered by the U.S. government in September for $2.94 billion. The company will supply the rest by Jan. 31.

Investing.com – Merck stock (NYSE:MRK) traded nearly 3.5% higher in Thursday’s premarket trading as British regulators becoming the first to approve its Covid-19 antiviral oral drug molnupiravir as safe and effective.
That makes molnupiravir the world’s first approved oral antiviral medicine for treating the dreaded infection.
The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency authorized molnupiravir for use in adults with mild to moderate Covid and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. The medicine is also pending review at regulators in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere.
Coronavirus infections in England reached their highest level yet in October, based on a large study published Thursday, according to Bloomberg.
Last month, U.K. officials said the country had secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir.
The company claims that the drug, developed jointly with Ridgeback Therapeutics, has shown consistent efficacy across viral variants Gamma, Mu and Delta, the most infectious of all.
Merck expects to produce 10 million courses by the end of 2021, with more to be produced in 2022. It will supply approximately 1.7 million courses to the U.S. government under an existing agreement, assuming all the approvals are in place.
According to a previous statement by Merck, if the emergency approvals were to come through by December, the drug offers an opportunity of up to $7 billion in sales in 2022 including $1 billion in revenue this year."

The British banking group's move comes as global leaders met at the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Scotland, where the finance sector is being pushed to accelerate action to help cap global warming.

The new rule will apply to both UK and non-UK customers who have UK coal production, coal fired generation and coal related infrastructure, a bank policy document seen by Reuters shows.

NatWest, which on Thursday was one of a number of companies to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, retained its target of phasing out all coal-sector lending globally by 2030 and confirmed it would start on Jan. 1.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp raised its profit outlook on Thursday helped by favourable currency rates but warned that the global semiconductor shortage still posed risks to its full-year production plans.
Like other global automakers, Toyota has been forced to cut output due to the chip shortage and lockdown measures that have slowed component production at factories in Malaysia and Vietnam, even as vehicle demand around the world rebounds from a pandemic slump.
It has already cut its production target for the year to end-March once to 9 million vehicles and last month slashed November output plans by as many as 150,000 vehicles.
""Even if we operate our plants at full capacity from December it will be tough to meet the production target, but we will try to achieve that,"" Chief Financial Officer Kenta Kon told a news briefing. 
After a better-than-expected jump in second-quarter profit, the world's largest carmaker by volume hiked its full-year operating profit forecast 12% to 2.8 trillion yen ($24.5 billion), which would mark a six-year high.
But Kon said that without the impact of a weaker yen which inflates the value of profits earned abroad, it was ""in substance a downward revision"" due to higher materials costs.
The annual profit outlook was lower than a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 2.9 trillion yen.
For the three months to end-September, Toyota reported operating profit of 750 billion yen, a 48% jump over the same period a year earlier and 26% better than market expectations.
It also announced a share buyback of up to 150 billion yen or 0.86% of shares and hiked its first-half dividend by 15 yen to 120 yen.
Although Toyota stuck to the production goal it announced in September, it lowered its full-year sales target by 260,000 vehicles to 10.29 million units.
Toyota's vehicle sales edged up 0.9% in the second quarter to 1.9 million units, as sales in Asia jumped 24%, while sales decreased in most other markets including Japan, North America and Europe.
In general though, car demand in key markets, such as China, the United States and Europe is rebounding following an earlier pandemic-induced slump, with demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in particular seeing healthy growth.
Like its peers, Toyota is investing heavily in technology and production capacity to build EVs as countries around the world impose tighter rules to cut carbon emissions. 
It has announced plans to have 15 battery electric vehicle models on the market by 2025, and will spend $13.5 billion by 2030 to develop EV batteries and their supply system.

Toyota's shares ended 0.7% higher after the results.

Chinese developers can sell residential projects before construction, but are required to put funds in escrow bank accounts monitored by local regulators.

Home buyers would not be permitted to sign a contract with the developer until they have put the entire deposit into escrow bank accounts, according to the draft rules published on the website of Beijing's local housing regulator.

The transaction should bring Santa Monica-based Bird $414 million and Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden told Reuters around two thirds of that money will go to expanding existing operations and another 20% should go to launching operations in new cities. 
""We plan to continue scaling out to all sizes of cities in the U.S. and Europe in particular,"" VanderZanden said. ""I don't think our trend of expanding to new cities is going to slow down.""
When Bird reported second-quarter results in August, it said it was operating in 300 cities worldwide.
VanderZanden said that number was now closer to 350 cities.
The scooter rental business is expected to undergo further consolidation as larger operators seek greater scale to handle tougher regulations from cities.

Bird's CEO said that as business rebounds following pandemic lockdowns - rides were up 43% in the second quarter versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019 - the company is confident in its 2022 revenue forecast of $400 million. 
""SPACs have got a bit of a bad name and that's partly because you have companies with no revenue or companies putting out wild forecasts that they can't deliver on,"" VanderZanden said. ""We fully intend to execute against that forecast and feel good about the numbers we’ve put out.""

(Reuters) -German speciality chemicals maker Lanxess on Thursday toned down its full-year profit expectations and warned that already elevated energy and freight costs could go even higher in the fourth quarter, sending its shares down sharply.
Lanxess' shares, down 7.1% at 1112 GMT, are headed for their worst day since March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic pummeled European stocks.
A rebound in economic growth after the pandemic has led to a surge in energy and raw material prices, putting pressure on companies to try to pass on the higher costs.
Cologne-based Lanxess, which makes a fifth of its sales from the auto industry, said it had managed to pass on the high raw material prices by adjusting selling prices amid global materials shortages.
But the company flagged further pricing increases to offset the steep rise in energy and freight costs.
Chief Executive Matthias Zachert said the company had gone with 20% price increases in the third quarter. ""I have never had that before during my tenure at the company, it's something exceptional.""
Zachert said prices for raw materials had stabilised in the meantime and added the chemicals industry was likely nearing a peak in the cost inflation, which would then be passed on to the wider industry and consumers through increased product prices.
Lanxess said that due to the cost increases, strained supply chains and power rationing in China, its underlying core earnings (EBITDA) would be at low end of the earlier forecast range of 1 billion to 1.05 billion euros ($1.15-$1.21 billion).
""The guide implies 4Q adjusted EBITDA of around 210 million euros which is around 12% below current implied Vara consensus,"" JP Morgan analysts said.
The group's underlying core earnings rose 44% to 278 million euros in the three months ended in September, but were only slightly above analysts' average estimate of 276 million euros.

Germany's BASF, the world's largest chemicals maker by sales, last month raised its 2021 earnings guidance as large industrial customers readily accepted marked-up prices for basic chemicals.

Investing.com –  Albemarle  stock (NYSE:ALB) jumped 4.3% in Thursday’s premarket as surging demand for lithium and specialty chemicals boosted sales and margins at the company in the third quarter.
The lithium miner raised its full-year guidance for EBITDA as demand for the metal from end-user industries like mobiles, computers, Internet devices and automobiles remains high in an environment of stretched supply.
Lithium demand has been transformed by the increasing adoption of electric mobility, taking demand for the metal well beyond its historic markets in consumer electronics.  
Group sales rose 11% to $830.6 million, while adjusted profit was $123.3 million.
Albermarle's largest division accounting for over 43% of the group total, lithium realized $359.2 million in net sales in the three months through September, rising by more than a third from a year ago. 
The company now sees full-year net sales at $3.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA at $845 million at the midpoint of its guidance range, up from $835 million previously.  It guided for better volumes and higher pricing and margins in the division than its previous forecast due to tight market conditions.
Business is booming for the company in its other lines as well. It said volumes in bromine, which accounts for 23% of group sales, will remain constrained “due to sold-out conditions and lack of inventory”.
The company took a hit of $657.4 million owing to charges related to an arbitration decision in a dispute regarding Huntsman’s acquisition of Rockwood's Pigments & Additives business in 2014. The Huntsman-Rockwood dispute is a legacy dispute that  Albemarle inherited when it bought Rockwood in 2015.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis AG said on Thursday it would sell its nearly one-third voting stake in Roche back to its cross-town rival for $20.7 billion, disentangling the two competitors that had been linked by the investment for more than two decades.
The deal extricates Roche from ownership ties to a major rival with strategic vetoing power, though it has however kept a passive role in the face of powerful Roche family shareholders.
The transaction sent Roche shares to a record high. By mid-morning, they were up 2.4%, while Novartis shares were up 0.2%.
Novartis has agreed to sell 53.3 million Roche bearer shares for $388.99 (356.93 Swiss francs) per share, a price that reflects the volume-weighted average of the Roche non-voting equity certificates over the 20 trading days to Nov. 2, Novartis said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Roche said it will use debt to finance what it called a ""disentanglement of two competitors"" and plans to reduce its capital by cancelling the repurchased shares to regain full strategic flexibility. 
Novartis' involvement started in 2001, when Swiss activist investor Martin Ebner, known for orchestrating the merger that created banking giant UBS , offered his Roche stake to its cross-town rival out of frustration over rebuffed proposals. 
Ebner at the time had amassed the holding in Roche to push for strategic change but ran into opposition from the founding families that control the group.
Roche shareholders will vote on the plan at an extraordinary general meeting on Nov 26. 
Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said now was the right time to monetise the investment. 
""Today’s announcement is consistent with our strategic focus and we intend to deploy the proceeds from the transaction in line with our capital allocation priorities,"" he said.
Novartis, which has taken a hands-off role as Roche investor without a director representing it on the board, said it will report a gain from the stake sale of approximately $14 billion. 
It said the investment acquired for around $5 billion in 2001 and 2003 had delivered recurring earnings contributions and cumulative dividends of over $6 billion.
As per Wednesday's close, Roche's shares had a run of more than 19% so far this year for a share price gain of about 160% since Novartis' appearance on the stock register in mid-2001. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said the transaction should provide an immediate 7% boost to earnings per share and for now put to rest lingering speculation that Roche could be eyeing larger acquisitions.
For Novartis, the deal further simplifies its structure after the maker of drugs against diseases such as arthritis, cancer and multiple sclerosis in 2019 spun off the Alcon (NYSE:ALC) eye care business and launched a strategic review of generic-drug division Sandoz.
Roche said all holders of Roche equity securities would benefit from the earnings accretion following the transaction. It confirmed its 2021 outlook and said it was aiming to increase its 2021 dividend.

The transaction will not result in a change of control as the founding families' shareholder pool already held the majority of the votes, it said. Its voting power will increase to around 67.5% following the deal.
Roche said the Swiss takeover board had exempted the pool from the obligation to submit a mandatory offer. The free float will increase to 24.9% from 16.6%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday it has referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution amid a sharp rise in onboard incidents this year.
The FAA and Justice Department said they had established an information-sharing protocol for the FAA to refer unruly passenger cases to the FBI for review.
The Justice Department and FBI ""are committed to prioritizing the review of the cases referred by the FAA and initiating criminal prosecution where appropriate,"" the agencies said.
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of disruptive and sometimes violent incidents this year, and the FAA has pledged a ""zero tolerance"" approach. The FAA and Justice Department said the ""increased coordination is part of a broader effort to prevent dangerous unruly passenger incidents.""
An FAA spokesman said the agency has initiated 227 enforcement cases and referred 37 to the FBI for review.
“Let this serve both as a warning and a deterrent: If you disrupt a flight, you risk not just fines from the FAA but federal criminal prosecution as well,” said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson.
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
FBI Acting Assistant Director Jay Greenberg said the agency is ""working in tandem with our partners to ensure the safety of all passengers and investigate crimes within our jurisdiction aboard commercial flights.""
Through Nov. 1, there have been 5,033 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,642 related to pandemic face covering regulations.
In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines, such as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, as well as aviation unions, asked the Justice Department to prosecute violent air passengers.
FAA and Justice Department officials began meeting in August ""to develop an efficient method for referring the most serious unruly-passenger cases for potential criminal prosecution,"" the agencies said, adding that ""resulted in a process where the FAA regularly sends cases to the FBI, which forwards those that merit potential prosecution to field offices for further investigation.""

On Monday, U.S. prosecutors in Colorado charged a 20-year-old California man with assaulting a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines flight bound for Santa Ana, California, that forced the plane to land.
Witnesses and court records said a flight attendant was punched in the nose, resulting in bleeding and a concussion. American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker called it ""one of the worst displays of unruly behavior we’ve ever witnessed.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening in a muted fashion Thursday, after closing the previous session at record levels following the decision of the Federal Reserve to cut back on its monthly bond purchases, an acknowledgement of the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 5 points, less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.1%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 60 points, or 0.4%.
The three major indices all closed at record levels for the fourth session in a row on Wednesday, after the U.S. central bank announced it would start reducing its $120 billion monthly bond purchases by $15 billion starting this month, aiming to be completed next year. 
Importantly, Fed chief Jerome Powell repeated that price increases would be “transitory”, even with inflation at 30-year highs, and thus interest rate hikes were not on the immediate agenda.
""We don't think it is time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment,"" Powell said, adding that he thought that goal could perhaps be met late next year.
U.S. private employers maintained hiring in October, according to the private payroll report by ADP. Thursday sees the release of the weekly initial jobless claims data, with last week’s 281,000 number being the lowest since the start of the pandemic, ahead of Friday’s official monthly jobs report. 
There are a number of companies scheduled to report quarterly results before the opening bell, including Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Kellogg (NYSE:K), while the likes of  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Square (NYSE:SQ) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) will post after the close. 
Other companies in the spotlight include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), after the semiconductor manufacturer offered up strong fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on the back of robust demand for its chips, and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), as travel rebounded during the July-September quarter.
Crude prices climbed Thursday, rebounding after recent losses ahead of a meeting of some of the globe’s top producers to discuss future output.
Weekly crude inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed a larger-than-expected build, suggesting the high gasoline prices are hitting demand for crude.
However, global supply remains tight and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, is expected to continue only gradually increasing overall production levels when they gather later Thursday.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $82.25 a barrel, after closing Wednesday at their lowest level since Oct. 13, while the Brent contract rose 1.9% to $83.53, having closed at their lowest level since Oct. 7.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,780.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.6% lower at 1.1546.

PARIS/CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Whitney Bromberg Hawkings launched her London-based floral business Flowerbx in Los Angeles last November, she noticed a number of clients, on their own for the holidays, treated themselves to bouquets.
“There were cards that said ‘Dear me, you can get through this week’— a lot of them,” said Bromberg Hawkings. This year, it’s a different story: It’s dinner for 30, dinner for 40, full-house decor.
""We’ve had a few people in New York and L.A. who want the whole house done – garlands on the outside, garlands on the inside, wreaths.”
But betting on a festive mood is precarious for many retailers due to the global supply chain crunch and shipping delays. 
At Balsam Hill, whose artificial trees decorate many upscale stores and shopping malls, unit sales of some of its most popular high-end trees priced at $500 to $2,000 have jumped as much as 64% year-over-year on a revenue basis. Its chief executive said the firm had shelled out at least $1 million so far this year on fees for delayed cargo, eating into its profits. 
From Neiman Marcus to Macy's (NYSE:M) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), several major retailers told Reuters that they expect to see shoppers pulling out all the stops at gatherings after Covid-19 kept them socially distanced last year. 
“After being limited by Covid-19 restrictions, people want to travel, spend more time out enjoying outdoor activities, express themselves and above all live and share experiences,"" Remo Ruffini, Moncler's chairman and CEO, said.
Many consumers are entering the holiday season with more disposable income, having saved up during lockdown and as economic rebound puts money in their hands. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs this week, while London's FTSE 100 index marked its highest close in 20 months.
“We’ve noticed a party theme,” added Macarena Blanco, fashion editor of Heuritech, a data firm analyzing about 30,000 pictures a day on social media, mainly Instagram and TikTok.
Yet retailers are up against a supply chain crisis that has left them scrambling to stock enough sparkling wine, tinsel, scented candles and partywear, among other things. In addition, the new AY.4.2 “Delta Plus” coronavirus variant looms, after causing some concern in the United Kingdom. 
""One of the big trends that we're seeing across the board is maximalism, which is really about 'more is better' and more opulence - it's embracing colors and embracing patterns,” Sarah Fishburne, Home Depot's director of trend and design, told Reuters. But in September, Home Depot during its quarterly earnings call said “raw material shortages, production constraints and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult supply chain environment.”
Rival Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) echoed this in October, saying second-quarter inventory was $17.3 billion, down $1.1 billion from the first quarter. Nonetheless, Bill Boltz, head of merchandising at Lowe's, said: ""They (shoppers) will want to go big this season ... We're expanding our selections. As an example, this year we will have a larger offering of artificial trees over 8 feet for those looking to fill a larger room.” 
‘TIS THE SEASON TO SPARKLE’
U.S. department store Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) recently blasted customers with an email urging them to “go full-on glam in sequins, metallics and more” and “dress to impress,” saying “tis the season to sparkle.”
But the previous week, the retailer alerted customers about global supply chain challenges and shipping delays, warning that the “hottest gifts may sell out on our site and that shipping could take longer than we'd all like.”
Festive fashion apparel has already been selling out, according to market intelligence platform Edited, which notes a 236% increase in full-priced garments selling out between July and October this year, globally, which has led fewer options for consumers shopping online in the United States – about half compared with the same time last year.
Macy’s is banking on its customers picking up metallic bags and shoes, velvet blazers and pearls among a string of fancy partywear. The company is among several retailers that have been forced to invest heavily in shoring up their supply chains to bring these products into the country. 
Macy’s said it is using multiple ports to reduce congestion, running its fulfillment centers 24/7, partnering with shipping giant Makers to efficiently pull product out of ports, and hiring more than 20,000 additional fulfillment center workers.
Designers are drawing on glitzy textiles, with sequins, for example, with references to the Nineties and the party scene at the onset of the year 2000, noted Heuritech's Blanco. The firm identified a rise in trends like glitter boots, which are up 15% in the United States from last year, and feathers, up 42%, for the end-of-year season.
Even Hello Kitty is getting jazzed up for the season, with a gold lightning streak added to her famous bow for L’Oreal’s upscale Japanese label Shu Uemura. 
The popular figure features in promotional materials for products including a disco glam eye palette and glitter ball highlighter with model Fernanda Ly, outfitted in a kimono and sparkling corset.
“After a spell when we were all cut off a bit from the world, we want to celebrate, to have fun and share with others,” said fashion designer Christelle Koche. The up-and-coming designer said she seeks to throw the spotlight on individuality, and for the season is offering an array of fitted velvet dresses, including an off-the-shoulder cut with pink flames running across one side.
Lana Todorovich, president and chief merchandising officer of Neiman Marcus, described the emergence of “dramatic and unapologetic style” from consumers heading into the holiday season, citing the popularity of pieces embellished with sequins and feathers from labels like Balmain and Tom Ford. 
Global designer clothing sales are expected to be $90.16 billion, up 11.6% from last year but still about $10 billion lower than in 2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Euromonitor.

(Reuters) -British challenger bank Virgin Money (LON:VM) revised its strategy on Thursday to switch faster to digital banking services, but warned it would have to spend more to get there, sending its shares down as much as 6%.
The lender said it aimed to cut 175 million pounds ($238 million) from its costs over the next three years, but restructuring costs incurred over the period would hit 275 million pounds to achieve this - around double what analysts had expected.
It said the additional cost savings would include cutting branches and offices and embedding remote working over time, but gave no further details.
Virgin Money said in September it planned to close almost one in five of its branches, axing 31 of 162.
The bank also said on Thursday it would return to full-year profit and reinstate a dividend of 1 pence per share, as it benefited from Britain's economic recovery from pandemic lockdowns.
Virgin Money said it expected to report pre-tax profits of 417 million pounds for the year to Sept. 30 in unaudited figures, compared to a 168-million pound loss the previous year.
""We think the market will focus on the significantly higher opex and restructuring costs guidance (in spite of the longer-term cost targets) and that the stock will experience selling pressure this morning,"" banking analyst John Cronin at Goodbody said in a note.
The shares were last down 4% at 1005 GMT. 
Virgin Money said its planned investment in digital services and cost-cutting would help it hit double-digit returns on tangible equity by 2024. 

The lender, born out of the merger of CYBG and Virgin Money, said its net interest margin - a key measure of a bank's underlying profitability - improved 6 basis points to 1.62%.

Investing.com – Qualcomm stock (NASDAQ:QCOM) jumped more than 6% in Thursday’s premarket trading as its fourth-quarter earnings reflected robust demand for its chips from various consumer industries.
The company holds sway in the mobiles segment but demand was strong for use in automobiles as well as Internet devices like tablets. Qualcomm technologies are now found in Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) Bike+ as well as Astro, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced household robot, the company said in a statement.
Comments from the company’s top management indicating that the global shortage of chips isn’t that big an issue now and that it is confident of surmounting the problem also boosted the stock.
“We feel pretty comfortable that the overall supply picture is playing out exactly as we had planned…and we've put in place plans both for dual-sourcing for certain parts,” Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhivala told analysts in a call.
The company also benefited from Huawei’s exit from the American market to post sales and profit that were ahead of expectations. Makers of Android-based mobiles, out to grab the Chinese handset maker’s market share, often use Qualcomm’s chips for smartphones.
Fourth-quarter adjusted revenue rose 43% to $9.32 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose by 76% to $2.55.
The company’s chipset business posted its fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year pretax growth. Revenue from automotive and IoT devices business topped $10 billion for the first time, growing 69% - a powerful indication of its pricing power with those sectors.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - In the midst of a major overhaul, Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) on Thursday posted better-than-expected third-quarter net earnings and forecast a profit for the full year, defying analysts' predictions for a 2021 loss.
The quarterly results were supported by a decrease in provisions set aside to cushion the fallout from the pandemic, as well as lower costs.
The positive tone in Germany echoed across much of Europe's banking sector, which for the past few years has been struggling with negative interest rates and the impact of COVID-19. 
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and ING also both reported better-than-expected profit on Thursday, helped by the release of provisions set aside for loan losses that didn't materialise.
Shares in Commerzbank rose 6.4% in early trade, while SocGen gained 3.6% and ING 2.3%. 
The outlook at Germany's No. 2 bank is a victory for the new Chief Executive Manfred Knof, who joined the bank at the start of the year to carry out a 2 billion euro restructuring involving hundreds of branch closures and 10,000 job cuts to get back on a path to profit.
""Despite the restructuring expenses, we are anticipating a positive net result for the full year,"" Knof said.
Before Thursday, analysts had expected Commerzbank to post a loss of more than 100 million euros for 2021 and to only return to profit next year. The bank posted a steep loss of 2.9 billion euros in 2020 due to restructuring costs. 
Graphic: Commerzbank results Commerzbank results: https://graphics.reuters.com/COMMERZBANK-RESULTS/klvykderzvg/chart.png 
It has been a rocky few years for Commerzbank. Merger talks with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) failed and it was ejected from the premier DAX index of German blue-chips. Last year, a major investor, Cerberus, launched a campaign for change that prompted a shuffle in top leadership and the plans for steep job cuts.
Commerzbank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, has lost about 2 billion euros from 2009 through last year.
The bank said it was halfway through the task of cutting positions, but as it does that it is also facing demands for higher wages amid soaring inflation. 
Workers will strike next week for one day as unions demand 4.5% pay increases for bankers in the industry.
Despite a decline in provisions in the quarter to 22 million euros from 272 million euros a year ago, Commerzbank's Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp told analysts that the bank wasn't out of the woods yet. 
The end of government pandemic support efforts will result in a rise in corporate defaults in the next quarter, she said. 

Provisions at SocGen were around half of what analysts had expected, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Major commodities traders sue Brazil coffee farmers for defaults,"By Marcelo Teixeira and Maytaal Angel
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities traders including Louis Dreyfus, Olam and Volcafe are pursuing legal action against hundreds of Brazilian coffee farmers whose failure to deliver on pre-agreed sales has left the merchants exposed to losses, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.
    Arabica coffee prices have rallied some 60% this year due to climate turmoil in Brazil. The price surge has tempted farmers to default on sales, tightening supply in a commodity that, like many others, has been affected by shipping delays and reduced availability of labor. 
All three of the world's largest arabica producers - Brazil, Colombia, and Ethiopia - are experiencing increased rates of default, where farmers fail to deliver coffee at agreed-upon prices so they can attempt to re-sell at current higher prices.
    Lawyers told Reuters this is the first time in decades that scores of coffee farmers are defaulting in Brazil, which grows about half the world's arabica beans. Defaults have spiked in other commodities like soybeans, where merchants have resorted to using satellites and deployed lawyers to go after farmers who tried to resell already guaranteed crops, as prices in that market, too, spiked.
Many court proceedings in Brazil are not public. 
Volcafe, the coffee trading arm of ED&F Man, one of the world's largest commodity trading firms, has had problems with about 5% of its contracts in Brazil, according to the company's North and South America director, Nicolas Rueda.
    ""We managed to negotiate and find a solution in most cases. Only in cases when talks ceased we resorted to the courts,"" he said, without identifying the number of cases the firm was working on.
    Olam confirmed cases of non-compliance and legal action but said they are not widespread. Louis Dreyfus did not return a request for comment.
Farmers are also defaulting in Colombia and Ethiopia, the world's second and third largest arabica producers. With Brazil, the three countries account for more than two-thirds of global arabica output.
    ""The incentive to default has never been higher (and) these guys are not just defaulting on one (season's) crop. You're looking at the tip of an iceberg here. It will get worse over next 12 months or longer,"" said a Europe-based trader at one of the world's largest coffee traders, who was not authorized to speak on the record.
Forward sales volumes in Brazil have plunged due to both defaults and severe shipping backlogs, said two other global traders, exacerbating already tight global coffee supplies.
    The high rate of defaults could push futures, already near seven-year peaks, up further as the market depends on forward selling from Brazil to temper price rises, said a second Europe-based trader at a global merchant. 
    ""There should be a continuous flow of (sales) from Brazil but everything's shut down. Its scary how quiet it is. We can't buy coffee. Our middleman can't get his coffee,"" he said.
    ""Put together with (shipping) issues, the defaults mean the availability of coffee in the U.S., Europe and Japan is getting more and more tenuous,"" he said.
    Evidence of the tightness can already be seen in ICE (NYSE:ICE) exchange stocks, which have fallen some 11% over the past month alone. The stocks are a cheap and reliable supply source relative to the physical market.
Law firm Santos Neto Advogados is working on about 30 lawsuits related to coffee defaults, said Fernando Bilotti Ferreira, a partner at the firm. He said he is acting on behalf of four trading houses but declined to name them. 
The size of the defaults vary from 500 bags to as high as 4,500 bags. At current market prices, a contract for 4,500 bags would be worth around 5.8 million reais ($1.03 million). 
Many traders involved in court cases have been accepting farmers' requests to postpone deliveries into 2022, said Cristiano Zauli, a lawyer working in Minas Gerais, Brazil's largest coffee producing state. He has been involved in around 100 court cases in coffee this year and acted as a mediator in hundreds more pre-trial talks, he said. 
Zauli declined to identify his clients.
FINDING COFFEE 
    Buyers who filed court cases are seeking legal orders allowing them to get their coffee from farms with the help of law enforcement officers, according to court documents in the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.
In one case, trader Olam had to go to two different locations to find the 750 bags it had bought from a farmer in Alfenas, Minas Gerais.
In another, Louis Dreyfus was trying to find 1,000 bags it bought from a farmer in Patrocinio, another Minas Gerais municipality. The trader's lawyer told the judge that the farmer re-sold the coffee to a local merchant, where it was delivered, according to the legal filings. 
Two local Brazilian coffee brokers told Reuters defaults have hit practically all market participants, including coffee co-op Cooxupe, the country's top exporter. 

    Cooxupe said it normally negotiates with farmers facing problems but added it cannot ""treat associated farmers differently,"" meaning the rules apply to all.

Lancashire, like other British insurers, has benefited from rising rates, which helped accelerate the recovery of a sector that paid out hefty claims for a number of covers including business interruptions during the pandemic.
The company reiterated its catastrophe loss estimate to be between $165 million and $185 million, and that included Hurricane Ida in the United States and floods that ravaged parts of Europe. Gross written premiums rose to $967.7 million in the nine-month period.
Hiscox, Lancashire's larger rival, posted robust written premiums earlier this week, helped by a 13% rate increase across its portfolio. The insurer had set aside $150 million in the reported period for catastrophe-related losses.
Lancashire, which underwrites aviation, energy, marine and property risks, had also estimated $40 million in losses relating to the unrest in South Africa this year.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, with the banking sector in focus after the Federal Reserve announced the winding down of its bond-buying program and ahead of the Bank of England’s policy-setting meeting.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, after opening at a record high, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, building on Wednesday’s record close. 
The U.S. central bank announced plans late Wednesday to start trimming its monthly bond purchases in November, potentially ending the program in 2022, judging the U.S. economy sufficiently recovered from the pandemic to begin withdrawing its monetary support.
This move had been widely expected, and importantly the Fed policy makers maintained their stance that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require an early rise in interest rates.
That may prove to be a contrast with the Bank of England, which has been more frank about being under pressure to raise interest rates to defend its credibility. 
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 0.1% after the Swiss bank announced plans to pare back its investment bank after posting a 21% fall in third quarter profit.
By contrast, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) stock rose 2.8% after the French bank posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and launched a share buyback program of around 470 million euros. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock gained over 4% after the German lender recorded a better-than-expected third-quarter net profit and forecast a profit for the full year, and ING (AS:INGA) stock gained 1.1% after the Dutch bank impressed in the third quarter.
Elsewhere, Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) stock rose 3.1% after the delivery firm increased its full-year operating profit forecast once more as global trade recovers, while HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) stock dropped 3.1% after the world's No. 2 cement maker reported a 11% drop in core profit on the back of higher energy costs.
 Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock rose 1.5% after it announced plans to sell its one-third voting stake in fellow drug-maker Roche (SIX:RO), up 1.9%, back to its cross-town rival for $20.7 billion.
In economic news, the main release will be the final purchasing manager’s index composite data for the Eurozone in October. German manufacturing orders managed only a weak 1.3% rebound from their August slump, which was revised down even further to -8.8%.
Crude prices gained Thursday, rebounding after recent losses ahead of the latest OPEC+ meeting.
Weekly crude inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday pressured the market, along with the news that Iran and world powers have agreed to resume nuclear talks later this month. But the focus Thursday is on the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, later in the session to discuss overall production levels. The group is expected to reconfirm a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day.
By 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $81.31 a barrel, after closing Wednesday at their lowest level since Oct. 13, while the Brent contract fell 1.1% to $82.91, having closed at their lowest level since Oct. 7.

LONDON (Reuters) -Hungary-based carrier Wizz Air warned that it faced headwinds over the winter but would be ready to take advantage of what it expects to be ""exceptional opportunity"" next summer, after it returned to profit for the July-September quarter. 
For the three months to the end of September, budget airline Wizz posted a net profit of 57 million euros ($65.99 million), in line with analyst expectations, and said it was already back flying as much as it did before the coronavirus pandemic in 2019.
That puts Wizz, the fast-growing airline believed to be behind a rejected takeover bid for bigger rival easyJet (LON:EZJ) in September, ahead of many competitors whose capacity remains at around 60%-80% of 2019 levels.
But chief executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters on Thursday: ""The next five months will be temporarily challenging"". 
Wizz's eastern European heartlands have lower vaccination rates than the markets it has expanded into in western Europe, plus like all airlines, it is facing rising fuel prices. It is currently unhedged on fuel. 
For its third quarter, the October to December period, Wizz guided that it expected an operating loss of about 200 million euros and warned that this loss could carry on into the January March period, depending on operating conditions. 
""This is a lot more cautious than anticipated and will require significant downgrades for this year’s forecasts,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said. 
Shares in the airline traded down 1.5% in early deals. 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline, on Monday also warned that fare discounting and higher fuel costs would hit its profits.
Looking to next summer, Varadi said that the expected end of coroanvirus restrictions and pent-up demand would make for a buoyant market. 
During the pandemic, Wizz has grown its fleet of planes to add bigger, more fuel-efficient models, and added new routes. 

""I see that we will be exceptionally well-positioned for taking advantage of the revamp of the market post-COVID,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Hugo Boss has shaken up its senior management team under new chief executive Daniel Grieder, who wants to make the German fashion retailer one of the world's top 100 global brands.
The German label, which raised its full-year outlook last month after third-quarter earnings rebounded, on Thursday said it had reshuffled management, including for its Greater China, Russia and emerging markets regions.
Judith Sun will be managing director for Greater China, former Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) executive Luigi Boiocchi will lead a newly created emerging markets and Russia unit while Christopher Koeber will head shoes and accessories operations after his arrival from Tommy Hilfinger last month.
The brand known for its smart men's suits had been struggling to revive the business for years before the COVID-19 pandemic prompted people forced to work from home to abandon formal wear for hoodies and sneakers.
However, the company on Thursday reported third-quarter sales and profit above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter.
Much of that was attributable to a revival in Europe and the Americas, though sales fell 1% in the Asia-Pacific region, as renewed coronavirus restrictions closing about 10% of its store network in the region.
Grieder, the former head of rival label Tommy Hilfiger, is trying to modernise the Boss brand and is seeking to boost its appeal for younger consumers by launching more casual styles and spending heavily on marketing with celebrities on social media. 

The Swiss CEO, who took over in June, has also placed greater emphasis on expanding online sales in a strategy he also persued at Tommy Hilfiger.
Hugo Boss also said on Thursday that it has set up new digital operations at its German headquarters in Metzingen and in the Portuguese city of Porto, with plans to relaunch the brand's website in early 2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Yusen and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Japan's biggest and third-biggest shipping companies, reported record quarterly profits as they benefited from higher freight rates amid the chaos hitting global supply chains.
The logjams and bottlenecks in the world's trade system, which threatens to derail a recovery from the worst health crisis in a century, has provided a bonanza to such companies as freight rates soared to the highest since 2008.
""Port and inland congestion did not improve due to a shortage of drivers for inland haulage,"" Nippon Yusen said on Thursday in comments on the results for the three months through Sept. 30.
Quarterly profit came to 260 billion yen, more than 25 times last year's amount, according to calculations by Reuters from the company's first fiscal half earnings announced on Thursday.
That is the highest quarterly profit for the company, according to Refinitiv Eikon data going back to December 2002. 
(For graphic on Baltic Dry index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/znpnekdlavl/Pasted%20image%201635937608713.png) 
Supply chain snarls have contributed to fuel shortages in Europe and Asia as the winter approaches and are threatening Christmas shopping even as freight rates have come off their highs.
Transport executives and analysts say the problems are likely to continue into 2022 and a U.S. agency is investigating improper freight charges.
Kawasaki Kisen's second-quarter profit increased nearly 14-fold to 144 billion yen from a year earlier, based on calculations from its first-half results, also released on Thursday. That was the most since at least June 2003. 
Mitsui OSK's quarterly income was nearly seven times the year-earlier amount, an earnings statement last week showed.
Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, this week said quarterly profit tripled to almost $7 billion.
Chief Executive Soren Skou described the world's trade system as ""one gigantic bottleneck"" and said that port delays would stretch into the new year. 

Nippon Yusen shares, which have soared 250% this year, slumped 8% on Thursday, while Kawasaki Kisen stock finished nearly 9% lower and Misui OSK ended the day down 2.6%. The Nikkei 225 rose nearly 1%.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY), the world's biggest maker of personal computers, said that a global chip shortage would persist into the first half of next year as it reported a 65% rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday.
The company said it was able to outgrow the market by securing more supply of components than its peers, but acknowledged that a dearth of chips was ""causing delays in order fulfilment and significant back-log orders across PCs, smartphones, and servers.""
CEO and Chairman Yang Yuanqing told Reuters in an interview that his earlier prediction that the shortage will remain unresolved at least until the first half of 2022 remained unchanged. 
""The shortage is driven by strong demand, particularly in the IT sector and in the electrical vehicle sector,"" he said. 
Shares in the company fell as much as 5% after its results which Guotai Junan analyst Gin Yu said reflected market concerns over how the semiconductor crunch, which has impacted goods from automobiles to home appliances, was affecting worldwide PC shipments. 
Research consultancy  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) said https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-10-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-1-percent-in-third-quarter-of-2021 last month that growth in worldwide PC shipments slowed in the September quarter as easing anti-virus measures prompted consumer and educational spending to move away from PCs to other priorities and chip shortages constrained laptop shipments. 
Lenovo retained the title of largest worldwide PC vendor by shipments, though its growth slowed after five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, Gartner said. In the third quarter, Lenovo's global market share grew 1.8% to 23.7%.
Yang said Lenovo has been helped by its unique hybrid supply chain model, which sources components externally and from in-house manufacturing, and while it had seen a dip in educational PC demand, commercial demand remained strong. 
Earlier on Thursday the company reported profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 attributable to equity holders jumped to $512 million versus $310 million in the same period a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 23% to $17.9 billion, slightly above an average estimate of $17.3 billion from 9 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.

Despite worries about chip supplies, Lenovo's shares have risen more than 70% over the last year, but investors were rattled last month when the company abruptly withdrew its 10 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) share listing in Shanghai. 
Yang said factors such as market conditions and the listing process were behind the decision, and said that the move would not hurt its business.

However, the company, best known for its sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets, said there were no significant availability issues at its retail business.
The impact of the supply chain delays has been greater on the wholesale business, with despatches 4 to 6 weeks behind plan due to intake delays, Superdry said, while adding it does not foresee a risk to the season.
The company also backed its full-year outlook.
Retailers have been navigating stagnant supply chains that have struggled to cope with rising demand as economies reopen, at a time the pandemic has caused widespread staff shortages. Britain is also adjusting to fewer EU workers due to Brexit.
Clothing retailer Next, which also sells Superdry clothes in its Label marketplace, on Wednesday cautioned sales would slow in the crucial holiday season amid supply chain issues.
Superdry said the pandemic continues to impact its physical stores and resulted in a 25.3% drop in revenue for the six months ended Oct. 23, compared with pre-COVID-19 levels.

""Superdry is recovering well from the disruption of the pandemic and I am really pleased with the start to the Autumn/Winter 2021 season, despite the ongoing disruption around the world,"" Chief Executive Officer Julian Dunkerton said.

The U.S. policy package contained no nasty surprises — the $15 billion reduction in monthly purchases was consensual and the inflation is ""transitory"" message was reiterated.
As a result, European stock futures point to new all-time peaks after Wall Street notched another record close. And with earnings still squeezing out positive surprises and real yields deeply sub-zero, many see no choice but to keep investing in equities.
With the Fed out of the way, it's D-day for the Bank of England which could become the first of the world's big central banks to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic hit. 
Poland surprised on Wednesday, with its biggest rate hike since 2000 , jolting its banking stocks to all-time peaks. 
Speaking of banks, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) saw better-than-expected Q3 profit growth, driven by strong corporate and investment banking revenues and lower bad loans.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), on the other hand, posted a 21% fall in Q3 net profit hit by higher taxes and charges to settle allegations of corruption surrounding loans to Mozambique.
Finally, Ether, the world's No. 2 cryptocurrency, scaled another all-time high, rising as high as $4,670.81.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 03:47AM ET</span>","Factbox-Spies, lies and losses: Credit Suisse's scandals","(Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will pare back its investment bank and focus on building its wealthy client base, the Swiss bank said on Thursday, as it regroups following a string of scandals.
Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, who joined in April from Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank to help stop the rot, has said the scandals are the gravest he has seen.
Here are some details about the main crises to beset the bank in recent years:
TUNA BOND FRAUD
Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to defrauding investors over an $850 million loan to Mozambique meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet and is paying U.S. and British regulators $475 million to settle the case under a deal announced in October.
About $200 million of the loan went in kickbacks to Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambican government officials. The bank was aware of a huge shortfall between the funds raised and the value of boats bought but failed to disclose this to investors when the loan was restructured in 2016, the regulators said.
Credit Suisse also arranged a loan that was kept secret from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). When Mozambique admitted to $1.4 billion in undisclosed loans the IMF pulled its support, sending the southern African country's economy into a tailspin. 
ARCHEGOS DEFAULT
Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion when U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March. The hedge fund's highly leveraged bets on certain technology stocks backfired and the value of its portfolio with Credit Suisse plummeted.
An independent report into the incident slammed the bank's conduct, saying its losses were the result of a fundamental failure of management and control at its investment bank, and its prime brokerage division in particular.
The report said the bank was focused on maximising short-term profits and failed to rein in voracious risk-taking by Archegos, despite numerous warning signals, calling into question the competence of its risk personnel.
GREENSILL FUNDS COLLAPSE
Credit Suisse was forced to freeze $10 billion of supply chain finance funds in March when British financier Greensill Capital collapsed after losing insurance cover for debt issued against its loans to companies.
The Swiss bank had sold billions of dollars of Greensill's debt to investors, assuring them in marketing material that the high-yield notes were low risk because the underlying credit exposure was fully insured.
A number of investors have sued the Swiss bank over the Greensill-linked funds. The bank said on Sept. 27 it had recovered and returned about $6.3 billion to investors but has warned it may struggle to recoup $2.3 billion of the total.
SPYING SCANDAL
Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam was forced to quit in March 2020 after an investigation found the bank hired private detectives to spy on its former head of wealth management Iqbal Kahn after he left for arch rival UBS.
The bank repeatedly played down the episode as an isolated incident.
In October, however, Switzerland's financial regulator (FINMA) said Credit Suisse had misled them about the scale of the spying. It said the bank planned seven different spying operations between 2016 and 2019 and carried out most of them.

In a rare rebuke, it said there were serious organisational shortcomings at Credit Suisse and that the bank had even tried to cover its tracks by doctoring an invoice for surveillance.
In response, Credit Suisse said that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>","Slowly, European regulators turn up the heat on greenwashing","By Tommy Wilkes and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - European financial regulators say they are uncovering more cases of greenwashing by asset managers cashing in on booming demand for sustainable finance, and some are starting to turn the screw on funds that cannot back up what they claim. 
Trillions of dollars have poured into sustainable investment strategies in recent years and regulators have taken little action to ensure funds are marketed accurately, partly because of the lack of agreement on what 'sustainable', 'green' and 'greenwashing' mean.
That makes it tough for watchdogs to prove deliberate exaggeration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, but this week IOSCO, which groups watchdogs, published recommendations to help members find firms who may be hoodwinking investors.
Regulatory risks have shot up the agenda since U.S. and German investigators said they were probing claims by the former head of sustainability at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s asset management arm, DWS, that it misled investors with its sustainable investing criteria. DWS rejects the allegations.
Lawyers in London said since those investigations were made public, asset managers were rushing to ensure they did not fall foul of regulators.
""We've definitely had more enquiries from our asset management client base, particularly around the marketing message - what is green? Are we getting this right?,"" said Richard Small, partner at Addleshaw Goddard.
""It's all too easy for this to turn into a mis-selling issue."" 
Regulators in France, Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland told Reuters they had found a number of instances where ESG claims were not backed up. The asset managers were asked to provide more information to support those claims, or forced to drop sustainability labels.
That shows how watchdogs are moving beyond the European Union's landmark Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which in March imposed mandatory ESG disclosure obligations on managers, to take more targeted action. 
French watchdog AMF has forced managers to drop ESG labels after finding ""completely unacceptable"" cases of greenwashing, including funds that justified ESG names by excluding stocks already proscribed under French law, said Philippe Sourlas, head of AMF's asset management directorate. 
""We have a range of tools to tackle greenwashing. It can go from soft bilateral communication with the asset manager, to public guidance issuance, to a sanctions process,"" he said.
Nick Miller, asset management department head at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, said weak fund disclosures were common.
""Often the quality of the information is not sufficient for us to even begin considering the (fund) application,"" he said, adding it also raised questions about whether managers met value for money regulations given ESG funds often charge higher fees.
Switzerland's regulator FINMA said it is dedicating more resources to tackling the problem and has ""immediately eliminated"" cases of greenwashing it has found, by forcing managers to drop ESG claims, or amend relevant disclosures.
HOT TREND
ESG is one of the hottest investment trends, with assets in sustainable funds nearly doubling in six months to reach a record $3.9 trillion at end-September, according to Morningstar. 
That explosive growth has left regulators playing catch up across the globe. 
In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has been asking managers to explain the standards they use for classifying funds as ESG-focused, sources said in September. Earlier this year the SEC said it had found ""potentially misleading"" claims related to ESG investing.
Reuters spoke with regulators in Britain, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, five of which had identified funds marketed in their jurisdictions which make claims unsupported by the information they disclosed. The other three had not carried out detailed investigations or declined to comment.
Sweden's Finansinspektionen found around 5% of 400 funds it examined made claims that did not stack up, head of sustainable finance, Johanna Fager Wettergren, said. 
""It indicates a broader problem and we can intervene against funds that don't conduct themselves properly,"" she said.
The FCA's Nick Miller said poor ESG disclosures were so widespread in the UK that it had written to fund manager boards in July setting out their need to disclose sustainability approaches in prospectuses and show how strategies can meet ESG objectives -- like why they choose certain stocks over others.
The United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an investor network, said it welcomed regulatory efforts to tackle the problem of greenwashing.
But CEO Fiona Reynolds said supervision should be proportionate and ""investors must not be discouraged from creating sustainability-focused products due to burdensome requirements.""
MIS-SELLING RISK
The approach of regulators to date has centred on publishing guidance and engaging in dialogue with managers. 
Proving deliberate mis-selling is hard when definitions of 'sustainable' or 'green' are still being debated. Some doubt the success of prosecuting cases under the current regulatory framework.
In the UK, the FCA's Miller noted that poor fund disclosure doesn't mean anyone had necessarily broken any rules.
The Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Swiss regulators said they hadn't launched any greenwashing-related enforcement action yet.
Switzerland's FINMA said statutory definitions of terms such as 'sustainable' and 'environmentally friendly' were needed first, while French regulator AMF is looking for improvements in ESG data and better definitions to help combat greenwashing.
The Dutch watchdog is waiting for the July 2022 introduction of SFDR's second phase, a more detailed application of the new disclosure rules, before it takes any action against managers individually, said AFM's senior supervisor Zoë du Chattel.
Tamara Cizeika, counsel at Allen & Overy, said that although regulators do understand new rules have a teething period, they are signalling that they are ready to take a tougher line. 

Britain's guiding principles, for example, are about the application of existing laws to a slightly new context, making it harder ""for asset managers to say 'can I have time to get it right?',"" she said.
""This is all about investor protection and market integrity. We'd argue that boards should sit up and take notice because it is a significant and growing risk.""

1621,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher as Market Digests Federal Reserve Tapering,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday, with investors digesting the Federal Reserve’s decision to slow its pandemic-era bond-buying program but still keeping an eye on the Bank of England’s policy-setting meeting later.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
The U.S. central bank announced plans late Wednesday to start trimming its monthly bond purchases in November, potentially ending the program in 2022, judging the U.S. economy sufficiently recovered from the pandemic to begin withdrawing its monetary support.
This move had been widely expected, and importantly the Fed policy makers maintained their stance that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require an early rise in interest rates.
That may prove to be a contrast with the Bank of England, which has been more frank about being under pressure to raise interest rates to defend its credibility. 
The banking sector will be in focus Thursday, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announcing plans to pare back its investment bank after posting a 21% fall in third quarter profit and said it expected to report a net loss in the fourth quarter due to a one-off charge of around 1.6 billion Swiss francs.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and launched a share buyback program of around 470 million euros, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) recorded a better-than-expected third-quarter net profit and forecast a profit for the full year, and ING (AS:INGA) also reported better-than-expected third-quarter pretax profit.
Elsewhere, Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) increased its full-year operating profit forecast once more as global trade recovers, while HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), the world's No. 2 cement maker, reported a 11% drop in core profit on the back of higher energy costs.
 Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) announced plans to sell its one-third voting stake in fellow drug-maker Roche (SIX:RO) back to its cross-town rival for $20.7 billion.
In economic news, the main release will be the final purchasing manager’s index composite data for the Eurozone in October.  German manufacturing orders managed only a weak 1.3% rebound from their August slump, which was revised down even further to -8.8%.
Crude prices weakened Thursday, extending recent losses on the back of an increase in U.S. oil inventories, progress in Iranian nuclear talks and ahead of the latest OPEC+ meeting.
Weekly crude inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, released late Wednesday, showed a larger-than-expected build of 3.3 million barrels for the week to Oct. 29, rising for the fifth week in six.
Also weighing was the news that Iran and world powers have agreed to resume nuclear talks later this month. This could potentially lead to the U.S. removing sanctions on the country’s oil industry, and thus an increase in global supply.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, meet later in the session to discuss overall production levels. The group is expected to reconfirm a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels a day.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $80.53 a barrel, after closing Wednesday at their lowest level since Oct. 13, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $81.91, having closed at their lowest level since Oct. 7.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,747.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1580.

Earnings at SocGen mirror those of U.S. and European competitors who slashed provisions for COVID-19 losses on a global economic rebound. A record wave of dealmaking and financing activities also bolstered results for lenders such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
France's third-largest listed lender, after BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) SA, said its net income nearly doubled in the reported quarter to 1.6 billion euros ($1.85 billion) from 862 million euros a year ago, and beat mean forecast for 952 million euros in a poll of analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
The lender improved its 2021 outlook for provisions. It now expects cost of risk, which reflects the level of provisioning against bad loans, not to exceed 20 basis points this year against a previous forecast of between 20 and 25 basis points.
In the third quarter, provisions decreased by 62.2%, while revenue grew 14.9% to 6.67 billion euros, above the 5.85 billion euros forecast by analysts.
SocGen said in a statement it was launching a share buyback programme of about 470 million euros.
Revenue in equity trading was up 53% in the third quarter while revenue in advisory and financing rose by 31%.
SocGen's Chief Financial Officer William Kadouch-Chassaing will leave the bank by the end of this month, and be replaced by current deputy financial chief Claire Dumas from Dec. 1, the lender confirmed in a separate statement.
Dumas, a former Deloitte auditor, joined SocGen in 1998 and has been the bank's deputy CFO since September 2017.

Kadouch-Chassaing, 52, will join French investment firm Eurazeo (PA:EURA) to succeed Philippe Audouin as CFO and head of strategy from March 2022, Eurazeo said.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 02:46AM ET</span>",Google to allow third party app payments for first time in S.Korea,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said on Thursday it plans to allow third-party payment systems in South Korea to comply with a new law, marking the first time the U.S. tech giant has amended its payment policy for a specific country. 
Google's announcement comes after a Korea Communications Commission's (KCC) request https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-google-asked-turn-skorea-compliance-plans-by-mid-october-2021-09-29 for Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to come up with compliance plans for the new law, which bans major app store operators from forcing software developers to use their payments systems. Most of the new law went into effect in mid-September.
The curb is the first such move by a major economy on the likes of Apple and Google, which face global criticism for requiring the use of proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%.
In late August, parliament passed an amendment to South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act - dubbed the ""anti-Google law"" https://www.reuters.com/technology/skoreas-parliament-passes-bill-curb-google-apple-commission-dominance-2021-08-31 - banning big app store operators, such as Google and Apple Inc from forcing developers to use their payment systems, effectively stopping them from charging commission on in-app purchases.
""We respect the decision of the National Assembly, and we are sharing some changes to respond to this new law, including giving developers that sell in-app digital goods and services the option to add an alternative in-app billing system alongside Google Play's billing system for their users in South Korea,"" Google said in a statement. 
Google, which charges developers a 15% service fee for distributing apps, said it would reduce this to 11% when users choose an alternative billing system, recognising that developers will incur costs to support their own billing system.
It was unclear how beneficial that would be for developers.
Google added that alternative billing systems may not offer the same protection or payment options and features of Google Play's billing system. 
The KCC said Google's plans would be implemented this year and would only apply to South Korea. 
""We were able to confirm Google's determination to comply with the law, and I hope (Google) will implement this policy change in a way to reflect the legislative purpose of the revised law,"" said KCC Chairman Han Sang-hyuk. 
In October, Apple told the South Korean government https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15 that it was already in compliance with the new law and did not need to change its app store policy. 

The KCC said it would ask Apple's South Korean unit for a new policy allowing greater autonomy in payment methods. If Apple failed to comply, it would consider measures such as a fact-finding investigation as a precursor to possible fines or other penalties.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Analysts had seen pretax profit at 1.80 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data. In the third quarter of 2020, pretax profit was 1.20 billion euros. 
“We saw continued lending growth in mortgages, whereas loan demand from businesses was influenced by the economic effects of the Covid pandemic,"" ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk said in a statement.
""Even so, our commercial lending margins were slightly higher and we saw strong fee growth in account package fees, investment products and lending.""

Helping profitability, the bank's net interest margin improved to 1.38% from 1.36% in the same period a year ago, while its cost-to-income ratio improved to 57.8% from 61%.
ING said provisions for bad loans were just 39 million euros, below normal levels, given it was able to reverse some provisions for bad loans taken amid the pandemic, as economies continued to rebound beginning in its key markets.
ING added 95,000 ""primary"" customers in the quarter, or those who bought more than one financial product from the bank, with strength in Germany and Poland. It has 14.1 million such customers in all.
Core lending growth was 3.1 billion euros, with 4.7 billion euros growth in consumer lending, mostly mortgages, and a negative 1.6 billion euros in wholesale banking loans, as commercial lenders repaid loans taken on during the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Steve Dickson told a U.S. congressional panel that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has ""more work to do"" as the planemaker continues to face scrutiny following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in the space of five months in 2018-2019 that killed 346 people.
""Boeing is not the same as it was two years ago but they have more to work to do,"" Dickson told the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday. ""We have reset the relationship with Boeing in no uncertain terms.""
Boeing said Wednesday it is ""is committed to full transparency and cooperation in all aspects of our relationship with the FAA. The ongoing dialogue facilitates continuous improvement in compliance and aviation safety to ensure that commercial aviation remains the world’s safest form of transportation.""
Dickson's comments came in the face of scrutiny from Congress. Senator Maria Cantwell, the committee chair, disclosed she plans to release a report on aviation whistleblowers by the end of the year.
""Line engineers had early warnings, whether it's the (Boeing) 787 battery issue, or whether it was this issue related to synthetic airspeeds or the complexity of automation and overload of pilots in the system,"" Cantwell said. ""Those line engineers weren't listened to.""
Dickson said the FAA is delegating fewer responsibilities to Boeing for aircraft certification. He told the committee the FAA is ""demanding more transparency"" from manufacturers.
The FAA is currently scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing airplanes.
Boeing agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in January including $2.5 billion in fines and compensation stemming from the 737 MAX crashes.
Congress in December approved legislation boosting FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections.
Cantwell pressed Dickson on whether the FAA can meet all the reform requirements.
""I'm not going to allow the law to be skirted here. This issue is about whether you're going to follow a process that allows us to see the work of the FAA, see that it's completed,"" Cantwell said. 

An FAA survey released in August 2020 found some safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
Dickson said on Wednesday he has ""made it clear internally that we always do the right thing when it comes to safety — and that I have the workforce’s back on that.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, with investors digesting the latest policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.97% by 10:12 PM ET (2:12 AM GMT), with markets re-opening after a holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.72% and in Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.18%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.33%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.51% while the Shenzhen Component inched was up 0.62%.
U.S. shares rose, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000 hitting record levels.
The Fed signaled the beginning of asset tapering as it handed down its decision on Wednesday. Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that interest rate hikes will not come anytime soon, he added, “we think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate.""
Longer-end U.S. Treasury yields halted a rally, while the yield curve remained steeper than before the Fed decision.
Measures of bond-market inflation expectations are climbing up as residual inflation concerns remain. However, investors largely maintained bets on interest rate hike timelines, with the first hike likely in July 2022 and some 55 basis points of increases by the end of 2022.
Monetary policy can “send a message saying rates do need to rise but in a controlled way and not as aggressively as some market pricing suggests,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer for core investments Chris Iggo said in a note.
“If they can do that, the risk of a market rout in bonds and equities will be reduced.”
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the monetary authority is “very unlikely” to hike rates in 2022, with investors split as to whether the Bank of England will hike interest rates when it hands down its policy decision later in the day.
The U.S. Treasury also announced the first reduction in its quarterly sale of longer-term debt in more than five years on Wednesday, a reflection of diminishing borrowing needs as COVID-19-era spending also falls.
Investors now await the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, due to be released on Friday."

Fujifilm shares surged as much as 4.8% versus a 1% advance on the benchmark Nikkei index. 
The company, which was scheduled to release the results after market close at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) in Tokyo, said it had inadvertently sent them to some overseas institutional investors early. That prompted Fujifilm to publish the results in Japan at 9:05 am.
The company is investigating the matter, a spokesperson said.
For the half-year, Fujifilm's sales rose 21% to 1.21 trillion yen ($10.60 billion), while operating profit jumped 91% to 107.9 billion yen. The company raised full-year forecasts for both.

The workers went on a strike on Oct. 5 after their contracts expired, as negotiations over payment and benefits stalled due to differences between the company and around 1,400 union members at Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s cereal plants.
The Froot Loops cereal maker said in a statement its revised offer, which is set to expire on Nov. 11 midnight, was immediately rejected by the union who refused to place it before the employees for a vote. 
""This is our ""Last Best Final Offer"" to the union."" 
Kellogg has demanded that workers give up quality health care, retirement benefits, and holiday and vacation pay, Anthony Shelton, president of Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) International Union, had said last month. 
The BCTGM union insists on proposals that are ""unsustainable and unrealistic"", Kellogg said on Wednesday. 
The union will continue with its strike, Bloomberg reported earlier in the day, citing a message from BCTGM. 
The union did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.
The revised offer specified that the company will continue with legacy wages and benefits with raised wages for current and future transitional employees, though it did not propose any changes to the current healthcare plans. 
Kellogg proposed a two-tier employment system that would slowly take power away from union by removing the 30% cap on the number of transitional workers, BCTGM members said.

""We are no longer proposing a permanent two-tiered structure,"" the company said. 
The latest stall in negotiations means Kellogg facilities that make breakfast cereals in Battle Creek, Michigan, Omaha, Nebraska, Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee would not be functioning at their full production capacity.

In a statement, Fonterra said it was looking to design dairy products that include time-controlled release of specific dairy nutrients, starting with probiotics that would keep it fresher for longer and allow nutrients to be more active. It didn't disclose financial terms of the partnership.
The cooperation deal comes as global supply chain disruptions highlight the need to bolster the storage duration of products while retaining their nutrition. The coronavirus pandemic has also increased healthy diet concerns as people around the world adapt to lifestyles that often include extended period working or staying at home.
""We can really drive our 'Active Living' business by appealing to the growing health and wellness consumer segment that desire the maximum functional benefits from food,"" said Judith Swales, chief executive officer for Fonterra's Asia-Pacific region. 

""Because the nutrients are encapsulated and highly targeted, it also means we can use less milk in our production, making our milk go further while reducing food waste,"" Swales said.
VitaKey's nutrients platform is based on technology licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and developed at the Langer Lab.

(Reuters) -Major Wall Street indexes posted solid gains and marked closing record highs as the Federal Reserve said it will begin trimming its monthly bond purchases in November with plans to end them in 2022, an announcement that investors had been expecting.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched record all-time closes for their fifth straight sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record close for the fourth session in a row.
The benchmark S&P 500 advanced into positive territory and ended solidly higher after the U.S. central bank announced plans to begin tapering its bond purchases. Investors had widely anticipated the decision as the Fed pulls back on its monetary support with the economy recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. 
“The Fed did not rock the boat on this one,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). ""It was fairly well-telegraphed what the Fed might do and they did what most people expected.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104.95 points, or 0.29%, to 36,157.58, the S&P 500 gained 29.92 points, or 0.65%, to 4,660.57 and the Nasdaq Composite added 161.98 points, or 1.04%, to 15,811.58.
Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, consumer discretionary and materials were the top gainers, rising 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Energy lagged, falling 0.8%.
The central bank's easy money policies have been a significant support for markets, with the S&P 500 more than doubling since its March 2020 low at the onset of the pandemic. 
The Fed also held to its belief that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require a fast rise in interest rates. 
“I don’t think that there’s anything unique in the statement other than the fact they’re trying to buy themselves time by saying both the inflation and supply chain disruptions are temporary, and that’s the bottom line,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, Americas chief economist at Natixis.
In a press conference after the Fed's statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it is possible the U.S. job market may have improved enough by the middle of next year to be considered at ""maximum employment,"" a key hurdle to clear for the central bank to consider increasing interest rates.
Better-than-expected third-quarter earnings also have helped lift sentiment for equities. With about 360 companies having reported, S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 40.4% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
In company news, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) shares rose 5.7% after the company said its adjusted profit target for 2022 should largely meet Wall Street estimates, as it expects volatile medical costs in its health insurance unit to stabilize.
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares rose 8.2% after the ride-hailing company reported an adjusted profit for the third quarter.
Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) shares tumbled 14.1% after the videogame publisher delayed the launch of two much-awaited titles. The stock was the biggest individual drag on the S&P 500.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 55 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 230 new highs and 38 new lows.
About 11 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 10.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Workers at the Illinois-based company continued their three-week-old strike a day after they voted to reject a second contract between Deere (NYSE:DE) and the UAW union that bumped up wages and bonuses.
""We're focused on getting our employees back to work through an agreement, and as such we're not ready to discuss detailed next steps, but all options are on the table,"" Deere said in a statement, but did not mention whether it will replace workers to restart operations. 
Deere and the UAW union will continue to have talks, a Deere spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday.
UAW had said the strike will continue after 55% of the workers voted down the agreement. 
Workers at 12 facilities in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas rejected the second tentative agreement, prolonging the first strike by the UAW union since 1986, which had lasted for 163 days.
The union said on Wednesday it was too early to comment on its next steps.
Deere would have invested an additional $3.5 billion in its employees through agreements reached with UAW, Deere Chief Administrative Officer Marc Howze said. It has forecast net income between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion this year.
The world's largest farm equipment maker added it will execute the next phase of its ""Customer Service Continuation Plan"". It did not immediately elaborate on the details.
Deere has already implemented ""cross-training"" -- or training salaried employees in production -- to mitigate the loss of output due to the strike, a person familiar with the matter said.
But brokerage  Barclays  (LON:BARC), using geolocation data, noted Deere's Construction and Forestry facilities witnessed the biggest drawdown in activity during the strike.

The latest contract would have provided a 10% rise in wages this year, 5% in 2023 and 2025, as well as lumpsum bonuses amounting to 3% of their pay for 2022, 2024 and 2026, according to UAW.
This was an improvement to last month's contract offer, which was rejected overwhelmingly by the workers, who then went on strike.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Voting technology company Smartmatic on Wednesday sued right-wing U.S. television networks One America News and Newsmax, saying they must be held accountable for spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
In separate lawsuits, Smartmatic accused OAN and Newsmax of knowingly spreading false claims that the voting technology company rigged the election against then-President Donald Trump.
Smartmatic says the networks doubled down on the false claims as part of an effort to win over Trump supporters dissatisfied with Fox News Network's election coverage.
The privately owned company sued San Diego-based OAN in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case against Newsmax, which is headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, was filed in state court in Delaware.
A Newsmax spokesperson said in a statement: ""While Newsmax has yet to receive or review the Smartmatic filing, Newsmax reported accurately on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress, as well as reporting on Smartmatic’s claims in its defense. Smartmatic’s action against Newsmax today is a clear attempt to squelch the rights of a free press."" 
An OAN representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Smartmatic did not say how much money it is demanding from Newsmax and OAN, but said election conspiracy theories have erased $2 billion in value from the company. Damages owed by each of the defendants will be determined at trial, it said.
Smartmatic, whose U.S. headquarters is in Boca Raton, Florida, in February sued New York-based Fox News, its parent Fox Corp and several Fox hosts in a New York state court, alleging they falsely accused the company of helping rig the U.S. presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.
In that case, Smartmatic also sued two lawyers aligned with Trump's Republican re-election campaign, Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who pushed the election-rigging conspiracy theory.
Smartmatic's lawsuit in that case stated the defendants should pay a combined $2.7 billion in monetary damages.
Fox News and its co-defendants have asked a judge to dismiss the case, arguing their commentary on Smartmatic was free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Fox News, OAN, Newsmax, Powell and Giuliani also face defamation claims https://www.reuters.com/world/us/dominion-sues-newsmax-one-america-news-network-others-over-election-claims-wsj-2021-08-10 brought by Dominion Voting Systems, another privately owned voting technology company that found itself at the center of false conspiracy theories in the weeks after the November 2020 election. 
Like Smartmatic, Denver-based Dominion is seeking billions of dollars in damages. Dominion has sued other individuals as well, including My Pillow Inc founder Mike Lindell https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-dominion/voting-machine-company-sues-my-pillow-and-its-pro-trump-chief-over-election-claims-idUSKBN2AM1LT.

Dominion scored an early victory in August when a judge allowed its defamation claims against Powell, Giuliani, and Lindell to advance toward trial.
Fox News has asked a judge to dismiss Dominion's claims, arguing Dominion's lawsuit ""threatens to stifle the media's free-speech right to inform the public about newsworthy allegations of paramount public concern.""

(Reuters) - As soon as Anna Weber Kneitel learned San Francisco Bay Area pharmacies had opened appointments for COVID-19 vaccines for young children, she booked the closest one she could find for her 7-year-old son.
But across the country in Michigan, Rachael LaPlante said she was planning to hold off on getting the shots for her 7-year-old son, despite being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 herself.
After months of anticipation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday gave the green light https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-vote-covid-19-vaccine-young-children-2021-11-02 for health professionals to start administering the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE shot to children ages 5 to 11.
That left parents of roughly 28 million U.S. school-age kids facing the decision on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-start-giving-covid-19-vaccines-young-children-2021-11-03 about how to proceed. 
The authorization comes as children across the country are adjusting to in-person school attendance after more than a year of remote learning in some areas. Children currently represent more than 25% of U.S. infections and can transmit the virus to those around them.
But some adults who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 themselves are feeling more hesitant when it comes to doing the same for their young children.
""We have a group of parents who are so excited that they want us to give them a call as soon as we have the vaccine so they can make appointments ... and we have parents that are still questioning,"" said Dr. Kimberly Montez, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina.
Some parents have expressed concern about the lack of long-term data on the vaccine's effects on children under 12. Others question its necessity given that severe COVID-19 is much less common for that age group, although many children have been hospitalized during the recent Delta variant wave.
LaPlante, 41, worries about rare cases of heart inflammation linked to the vaccine, particularly in young men, even though health experts say the heart risks from contracting COVID-19 are far greater. 
""I struggle with it,"" she said. ""What if it turns out that there are long-term problems for boys?""
LaPlante and her husband, who works from their home in Rochester, Michigan, continue to observe social distancing and masking protocols to protect against infection.
She said their son, who is home-schooled, plays outside with friends and sees his cousins for baking parties and other organized events over video chat services.
For Kneitel, a 41-year-old physician, getting her son vaccinated - and her daughter as soon as she turns 5 next year - means the family can return to a more normal social life. She said she is eager for them to resume sports and ballet, as well as going to concerts and theater performances.
GROWING LESS HESITANT 
A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in August found that about a quarter of parents want their young children vaccinated ""right away,"" with another quarter in the ""definitely not"" camp.
In interviews, pediatricians and public health experts said parents appear to be growing less hesitant as time goes on.
In Ellerslie, Georgia, Chrissie Jennette, 41, said she will get her three young sons vaccinated as soon as possible.
""I know there was concern that it was a quick rollout, but there was never a moment I was concerned,"" Jennette said.
But in the small Alabama city of Enterprise, Claire Deaton, 33, does not plan to make appointments for her children.
She has received a first COVID-19 shot, while her husband, a retired military pilot who now does training and is required to get vaccinated for work, so far has not. Both have had COVID-19 twice, and their children were never sick, she said.

Though her kids have received all of the regular childhood immunizations, Deaton said she does not see the COVID-19 vaccine as necessary for them so far.
""If things started changing and it was affecting more children, or if we had a huge outbreak in local schools, I would be more open to getting it,"" she said.

Its shares rose 3.7% in extended trading as gross travel bookings surged 77% from a year earlier to $23.7 billion. Room nights - a measure of occupancy at any property - rose 44%.
But the online travel agent, owner of travel website Kayak, said a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in countries including Germany, Russia and Italy had hit room nights in Europe towards October end.
""Looking forward to November and December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and much of Eastern Europe ... creates unpredictability,"" Chief Financial Officer David Goulden said on an earnings call.
Trends were improving in Asia, where higher vaccination rates and easing travel curbs boosted domestic travel, it said.
The company has also recorded more gross bookings for the Christmas and New Year period in the United States compared with pre-pandemic 2019.

Total revenue rose 77% to $4.68 billion in the third quarter to beat expectations of $4.30 billion.

Take-Two raised its annual adjusted sales outlook to between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, citing strong demand for its key franchises ""Grand Theft Auto V"", ""NBA2K"" and ""Red Dead Redemption 2."" 
EA is also considering renaming its top-selling soccer franchise ""FIFA"" as it reviews a rights agreement with the sport's international governing body. 
A name change of the nearly three-decade franchise might make attracting new players more difficult, analysts say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives released an updated social spending and climate measure on Wednesday that expands a proposed $12,500 tax credit to pricier zero-emission vehicles, while lowering income limits for eligible buyers.
The updated bill, which could be voted on by the House in coming days and now includes paid family leave, revises pricing for vehicles eligible for the credit. Vans, sport utility vehicles and trucks with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of up to $80,000 are eligible, while sedans remain at $55,000 as they were under the prior version.
The earlier version capped credits at $64,000 for vans, $69,000 for SUVs and $74,000 for pickup trucks. The prior EV tax credit plan was estimated to cost about $15.6 billion over 10 years.
The new proposal limits the full EV tax credit for individual taxpayers reporting adjusted gross incomes of $250,000 or $500,000 for joint filers, down from $400,000 for individual filers and $800,000 for joint filers.
The proposal would give a big boost to electric vehicles but faces opposition from Republicans, foreign automakers and foreign governments.
The House plan includes a $4,500 incentive for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any of the $12,500 credit.
The EV tax credits are backed by President Joe Biden and the United Auto Workers union and would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
Foreign automakers have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a big leg up, while 25 ambassadors wrote lawmakers https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/international-opposition-mounts-proposed-us-ev-tax-credit-2021-10-30 on Friday opposing it.
The EV proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would again make GM eligible, along with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.

Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing U.S. factory workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
The bill would create an electric bike tax credit, a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles and a $4,000 used EV tax credit.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's two biggest life insurance companies, Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) and Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF), reported a rise in third-quarter profits on Wednesday, driven by growth in new business and higher assets under management. 
Sun Life beat analysts' expectations, helped by a 23% surge in earnings from its asset management business that offset losses in the U.S. and Asia from COVID-related claims, but Manulife missed estimates due to weather-related charges.
While the pandemic and related claims, largely outside of Canada, have weighed on parts of insurers' businesses, the growth in wealth, lifted by lockdown-induced savings and government stimulus has proved a boon for their wealth management units. 
Core earnings at Manulife, Canada's biggest life insurer, rose to C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion), or 76 Canadian cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from C$1.45 billion, or 73 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 79 Canadian cents. 
The company took a C$152 million charge in its property and casualty reinsurance business due to estimated losses from Hurricane Ida on the U.S. Gulf Coast and floods in Europe, above about C$135 million expected by Canaccord Genuity analysts. 
Manulife reported a jump in assets under management that boosted its global wealth and asset management business and helped offset lower earnings in Asia and the United States.
Underlying profit at smaller Sun Life was C$902 million, or C$1.54 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from C$842 million, or C$1.44, a year earlier. Analysts had expected C$1.52 Canadian cents.

Earnings fell 19% in the United States and 12% in Asia, driven in part by COVID-19 related claims in the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as the negative impacts of foreign exchange movements. However, this was offset by a 23% increase in earnings from its asset management unit.

(Reuters) -U.S. oil and gas producers on Wednesday posted quarterly profits that beat Wall Street expectations as energy prices recovered from pandemic lows to multi-year highs, prompting some drillers to raise dividend. 
U.S. natural gas prices have surged more than 60% in the third quarter, while U.S. crude has climbed about 73% since the start of the year.
 Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) Callon (NYSE:CPE) Petroleum Co and Apache (NASDAQ:APA) parent APA Corp earned more than market predictions, while Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) Inc's adjusted profit in the third quarter was in line with consensus.
The five companies sold their U.S. oil at 81% higher price than a year earlier and gas at nearly three times more, according to a Reuters calculation.
But unlike during previous booms in oil prices, producers did not raise spending to boost production and instead chose to return cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
Continental on Wednesday increased its quarterly dividend by 5 cents per share to 20 cents, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co raised it by more than 10% to 62 cents and declared a variable dividend of $3.02 per share per quarter. 
APA Corp raised its dividend for the second time this year, while Marathon Oil increased its base dividend for the third straight quarter to $0.06 per share. 
Continental, which raised its capital expenditure by $100 million to $200 million, said it would buy Pioneer's Delaware basin assets in an all-cash deal valued at $3.25 billion.

Pioneer raised its full-year total production to between 613,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boped) and 619,000 boepd from earlier outlook of 605,000 boepd 631,000 boepd.
Shares of Marathon, Apache and Callon were up between 1.3% and 2% in extended trading.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 06:22PM ET</span>",Qualcomm forecast beats estimates as diversification efforts pay off,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday forecast better-than-expected profits and revenue for its current quarter on soaring demand for chips used in phones, cars and other internet-connected devices. 
The San Diego company, still the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, has worked to diversify its chip portfolio. Its optimistic forecast came even as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been struggling with supply chain issues and reporting uneven results.
Those global snarls have benefited Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) because they have forced profit-hungry phone makers to focus their limited supplies on their most lucrative premium handsets, the market segment where Qualcomm is strongest. Qualcomm has also benefited from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's exit from the smart phone market. The Chinese firm's Android phones had used proprietary chips, but many of the handsets replacing them use Qualcomm's chips.
Following Qualcomm's forecast, the company's shares rose 3.6% in after-hours trading. 
Qualcomm said it expects adjusted earnings per share to grow between $2.90 and $3.10 per share for its first quarter, beating estimates of $2.59 according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon told Reuters that efforts undertaken earlier this year to secure additional chip supplies have been successful and are on track. 
""It's reflected in our record Q1 guidance - it means we have supply,"" Amon said in an interview.
During a conference call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said Qualcomm expects fiscal 2022 adjusted profit growth of more than 20%, compared with Wall Street estimates of 12.5% growth, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.
The company also said it expects revenue with a midpoint of $10.40 billion for its fiscal first quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season in the United States and Europe, compared with analyst estimates of $9.68 billion.
The upbeat forecast could signal the easing of a global chip shortage that has hit production for a number of major Qualcomm customers, including Apple and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd. 
Qualcomm defied broader supply chain issues, even as one of its biggest customers, Apple, missed Wall Street expectations for iPhone sales. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-results-hit-by-supply-chain-woes-cook-says-holiday-quarter-impact-will-be-2021-10-28 the issues were poised to grow worse on a dollar basis during the holiday shopping quarter.
Qualcomm has worked to diversify its chip manufacturing partners, which are called foundries. It is one of few chip designers that uses both Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to make dueling versions of its cutting-edge chips. For older technologies it leans of a network of suppliers including TSMC, United Microelectronics Corp and China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. 
""Some have said that Qualcomm's multi-foundry approach was too complex, but now it's looking very smart,"" said Patrick Moorhead, head of Moor Insights & Strategy.
Amon told Reuters the booming chip results were driven in large part by the Android phone market, where Qualcomm customers such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp are snapping up former Huawei users.
The chipmaker said revenue rose 43% to $9.32 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 26, compared with estimates of $8.86 billion, according to Refinitiv data. It earned $2.55 per share, on an adjusted basis, exceeding analyst expectations of $2.26.
Its chip segment had fourth quarter revenues of $7.73 billion, above analyst expectations of $7.27 billion, according to data from FactSet.

For decades, Qualcomm's biggest business was selling the modem chips that connect smart phones to wireless data networks. While that market remains its biggest, other markets such as radio-frequency chips, automotive chips and internet-of-things chips accounted for more than $10 billion of its $27 billion of chip revenue in fiscal 2021.
""If 38% (of chip revenue) doesn't do it, I don't know what does,"" Amon told Reuters about the company's diversification effort.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -World shares climbed on Wednesday as U.S. Treasuries rose and the curve steepened after the U.S. Federal Reserve, as expected, approved plans to begin scaling back its bond-buying stimulus program this month and end it by June.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.45% as investors digested the decision taken amid a surge in inflation. 
Wall Street hit closing record highs, with the benchmark S&P 500 advancing 0.65%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29% while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.04%. 
The Fed also maintained its assessment that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require a fast rise in interest rates. 
The Tokyo bourse was closed for a public holiday while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.03% lower.
The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell to a 2-1/2-week low of 1.519% earlier in the session, climbed to a session high of 1.602%. It was last up 4.2 basis points at 1.5893%.
John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, said while the wording in the Fed's meeting statement provided ""some acknowledgement of the uncertainty regarding the transitory nature of inflation,"" the central bank continued to espouse the transitory view.
At the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, the Fed said monthly $120 billion purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities would be trimmed by $15 billion a month starting this month, with plans to end the program in 2022. 
Oliver Pursche, a senior vice president at New York-based Wealthspire Advisors, said Wednesday's market reaction indicated that the Fed announcement was very much in line with investor expectations. 
""It's also leading me to think ... we can probably expect one, maybe two, rate hikes tops in late 2022, which is less than many had kind of priced in,"" said Pursche, adding that he views ""a lot of (future Fed) actions are going to be predicated on continued economic improvement and the inflation outlook.""
Boosted by fiscal and monetary stimulus, global stocks have thrived during the economic rebound after the recession triggered by the first wave of COVID-19 infections in 2020. ]
Fed officials are trying to maintain a difficult balancing act by giving the economy as much time as possible to recover while tightening policy soon enough to contain inflation. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. job market may have improved enough by the middle of next year to be considered at ""maximum employment,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday after its policy meeting.
Officials did not see ""troubling increases"" in workers' wages that might raise the risk of a wage-price spiral developing that could force the Fed to act sooner than expected to contain inflation, he added.
Better-than-expected third-quarter earnings also have helped lift sentiment for equities.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pushed back on market bets on an interest rate hike as soon as next October, saying it was ""very unlikely"" such a move would happen in 2022. 
Fixed income investors are also eager to find out whether the Bank of England will on Thursday become the first major central bank to raise borrowing costs after the coronavirus crisis. 
The dollar index softened after the Fed statement, hitting a session low before reversing some of the losses and fell 0.267%.
The euro was last up 0.28% at $1.1609.
Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high on Wednesday, catching up with bitcoin's rally and riding on news of wider blockchain adoption.
U.S. crude stocks and distillate inventories rose while gasoline inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
    Crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week to Oct. 29 to 434.1 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.2 million-barrel rise.

U.S. crude recently fell 4.67% to $79.99 per barrel and Brent was at $81.20, down 4.15% on the day.
Spot gold dropped 0.9% to $1,770.62 an ounce.

The company reported adjusted profit of $2.1 billion, or $2.39 per share compared to $1.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.74 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Global life insurers have been benefiting from a rebound in investment income, helping them offset increased payouts related to the health crisis. Total variable investment income more than doubled to $1.41 billion from a year earlier. 
""MetLife delivered another very strong quarter. Outstanding variable investment income more than offset elevated COVID claims..."" Chief Executive Michel Khalaf said in a statement. 
The New York-based insurer, which had earlier said that the worst of the pandemic was behind it, reported an 18% jump in net investment income to $5.57 billion on strong returns from private-equity investments. 
Rival Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) too had reported solid quarterly adjusted profit, driven by strong performances at the U.S. insurer's life and annuity units.
Adjusted earnings at Metlife's U.S. business fell 1%, while Asia clocked a 22% jump, helping offset weakness in Latin America, where its business was hurt by higher COVID-19-related claims.
Adjusted earnings in its U.S. group business took a $290 million hit from pandemic-related claims, a jump from $75 million in the prior quarter, due to a bigger share of COVID-19 deaths under age 65. 
It reported net derivative losses of $218 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The insurer holds a book of derivatives to hedge against market volatility. 

Such gains do not indicate the actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters too.
Metlife's shares rose 2.5% in extended trading.

The company's stock rose 4.1% to $272.80 in after-hours trading following the results. Demand for lithium and other EV minerals has jumped in recent months as automakers around the globe announce aggressive plans to switch to all-electric fleets. 
Sales of lithium, the company's largest division, jumped 35% during the quarter, helped by rising prices.  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Chief Executive Kent Masters forecast ""increasing demand from our customers"" for the EV battery metal. 
Albemarle posted a third-quarter net loss of $392.8 million, or $3.36 per share, compared with a net profit of $98.3 million, or 92 cents per share in the year-ago quarter, even as revenue rose 11%. 
The result included a $657.4 million charge related to an arbitration decision about Rockwood Holdings Inc's 2014 sale of a pigments division to  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp. Albemarle inherited Rockwood's liabilities in a 2015 buyout, which made it the global lithium leader.
Excluding that charge and other one-time items, Albemarle earned $1.05, well ahead of analysts' expected earnings of 77 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company opened its La Negra III/IV lithium production facility in Chile during the quarter and said it expects to finish construction on its Kemerton lithium production facility in Australia by the end of the year.
Albemarle also bought a lithium processor in China during the quarter, boosting its operations in the world's largest electric vehicle market. 

Sales rose in the company's bromine division, which sells chemicals for fire extinguishers and other products, and fell in the catalysts division, which sells materials for oil refineries. 
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company is scheduled to hold a conference call with investors on Thursday morning to discuss the quarterly results.

The home products maker was tethered to the meme stocks phenomenon this year, where individual investors coordinated in online message boards like Reddit and Stocktwits to fuel eye-popping rallies in certain shares, costing short sellers billions of dollars.
About 29% of Bed Bath & Beyond free float is shorted, according to financial analytics firm Ortex. The surge in the company's shares amid high short interest makes it ripe for a ""squeeze"" where investors betting against the company are forced to unwind their exposure to stem losses.
Analysts at BofA Securities said while Bed Bath & Beyond's announcements were enough to squeeze short sellers, the company still faces risks in the coming months, including cost inflation pinching its margins.
Shares of the company closed at $19.30 after rising to $25.72 earlier in the session.
Other retail darlings  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc added 5.48% and 5.15%, respectively, while Koss Corp and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) were up 2.49% and 2.89%, respectively.
Another highly shorted stock,  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc, slid 16.54% on Wednesday, a day after its shares doubled in value on strong results.
AMC, Workhorse Group Inc, Bed Bath & Beyond and Avis were among the most touted stocks on Stocktwits.
After a subdued October, the appetite of retail investors appears to be rising with most of their interest concentrated in technology stocks, analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said in a weekly note on Wednesday.

Bed Bath & Beyond on Tuesday announced it would speed up its $1 billion share buyback program, saying it would complete it by the end of 2021, two years ahead of schedule. The company also said it was partnering with Kroger to bring its line of home and baby products to the grocer's website.
""The announcements should be received positively by investors, especially the share buyback, which we estimate has the potential to reduce the share count by 15% and boost 2022 EPS,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in a client note.

(Reuters) - Cathie Wood's Ark Invest on Wednesday capitalized on a sharp drop in Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) Inc's stock price to scoop up shares of the online real-estate firm, as analysts expressed shock over its move to exit the business of buying and selling homes due to unpredictable prices.
Zillow's announcement on Tuesday that it was withdrawing from flipping homes came three years after introducing the Zillow Offers business, which buys homes from owners, performs light repairs on them and sells them later.
Its Class A shares fell as much as 20% to a 14-month low of $68.65 in morning trade. Ark Invest, in its daily report, said it had bought 288,813 shares of the company.
Volatility in home prices in the past few months have hurt Zillow's ability to forecast prices accurately, it said. The company concluded that ""continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.""
U.S. median home prices rose 18.4% in July and 14.9% in August before accelerating 18.7% in September.

The fight over the so-called New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) project reflects the difficulty that developers face nationwide in siting new transmission lines. Many more must be built in the coming decades to modernize the nation’s creaking grid systems and connect far-flung renewable energy sources to population centers.
The owner of the transmission line, power company Avangrid (NYSE:AGR) Inc, swiftly filed a lawsuit in Maine Superior Court in response to the vote. The lawsuit argues that under state law, rules cannot be changed to stop a project.
Some 59% of Maine voters rejected the project, with nearly 90% of ballot stations reporting by Wednesday morning, according to local media outlets.
NECEC was meant to bring some 1,200 megawatts of Quebec hydropower to New England along a new 145-mile (233-km)transmission line through Maine’s northern forests. More than three-quarters of the corridor has already been cleared, with about 100 poles installed, Avangrid said last week.
Supporters of the project, including Avangrid utility Central Maine Power and HydroQuebec, billed it as a way to help New England states and the country fight climate change, since hydropower production emits no greenhouse gas emissions.
But opponents, supported by U.S. power company  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE), which has competing generating projects in New England, argued that the line would cause permanent damage to Maine’s north woods and hurt the region’s tourism industry.
The fight for votes cost both sides almost a combined $100 million, making it the most expensive referendum question in Maine’s history.
The project was proposed in Maine in 2017 after a previous proposal to run a transmission line through New Hampshire was blocked by local opposition. It received a series of state and federal permits from 2019 to 2021 and began construction early this year.
“This referendum effectively tears up valid contracts, ignores the judicial and executive branches and goes back in time to retroactively change the rules to stop a project just because it threatens the financial interests of fossil fuel

LISBON (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) software boss Craig Federighi took the stage at the Web Summit in Lisbon to voice the iPhone maker's objections to EU draft guidelines that could allow customers to install software from outside its App Store.
Apple contends that such a move would make phones the target of malware or hijacking by cybercriminals and the company is sending top executives to Europe to garner public support and show its resolve in stopping the proposal becoming law.
The Digital Markets Act under consideration in Brussels would force phone makers to allow third-party software to be installed on their devices from outside official app stores. 
Big Tech critics say Apple and others use their control over software to entrench their dominant positions, while Apple argues its policies are a matter of keeping users safe. 
Apple calls such unofficial app installations ""side-loading"". Such a function is already available on Android phones that make up a majority of devices around the world. Apple warned of malicious apps infecting shopper gadgets and made doomsday predictions.
""Sideloading is a cybercriminal's best friend,"" Federighi pressed the case on stage, addressing thousands of attendees at Europe's largest technology conference.
One compromised device could overflow into entire networks, and malware could jeopardize government systems, enterprise networks and public utilities, he said.
The draft rules need a green light from EU lawmakers and EU countries before they become law, likely https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-cybercrime-risks-if-eu-forces-it-allow-others-software-2021-10-13 in 2023.
Apple charges commissions of up to 30% for purchases made within the App Store and loosening its grip on it might allow developers to avoid paying those commissions.
Companies such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), which have been fighting Apple on different fronts, from privacy changes on iOS devices to high commissions, have called Apple's policies as ""anticompetitive.""

""The discussion about sideloading is just a sideshow, which is really designed to deflect the conversation away from the things that Apple is doing that are clearly anticompetitive,"" Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said in an interview. 
""No one is arguing that Apple should lower their standards for privacy and security... it's perfectly logical that Apple would set and enforce certain standards with respect to privacy,"" he said.

Investing.com – The major averages jumped to fresh record highs Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve announced its plan to taper its monthly bond purchases later this month, but stopped short of signaling that sooner rate hikes were on the horizon. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.29% to record of 4,660.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.29%, or 104 points to a record of 36,157.58. The Nasdaq climbed 1.04% to a record of 15,811.58. The Russell 2000 rose 1.8% to a record of 2,404.28.
The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday detailed plans to begin scaling back asset purchases later this month, with a view to ending its bond-buying program by June next year.
The monthly bond purchases of $120 billion -- $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities – would be trimmed by $15 billion a month.
In the press conference that followed the monetary policy, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed the potential for sooner rather than later rate hikes. 
""[W]e don't think it's a good time to raise interest rates because we want to see the labor market heal further,"" Powell said. [W]e have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines."" Powell added that he sees inflation moving down by third or fourth quarter.
Growth sectors of the market including tech, which are sensitive to rate hikes, were sharply higher. 
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher.
Following of the decision, Treasury yields briefly moved higher, but the United States 10-Year yield ended the day below 1.6%.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also in the ascendency following data showing signs of increased services sector growth.
On the economic front, U.S. services activity swelled to a record last month, driven by a further reopening of the service sector.
The ISM non-manufacturing index, which tends to track the rate of growth of core retail sales, was overall ""very strong,"" rising to a record high o f66.7 from 61.9, well above the consensus, 62.0, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), PVH (NYSE:PVH) were the largest sector gainers. 
""The surge in the index sends a positive signal about the post-Delta economy,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note. ""The bad news is that the supply-chain indicators - supplier delivery times, prices paid, and the order backlog - all materially worsened, with all three hitting new highs."" 
Industrials were in the red paced by a decline in Deere (NYSE:DE) and Generac.
Generac (NYSE:GNRC) slumped more than 6% after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the energy technology solutions provider to neutral from buy, citing valuation concerns.
The bank said that while it was ""difficult"" to pull its buy rating on the stock following the company's ""overwhelming"" growth rates, at some point valuation has to matter.
Energy, meanwhile, ended the day lower following a decline in oil prices following a bigger-than-expected increase in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles. 
Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) were down more than 2%.
The fall in oil prices comes just a day ahead of OPEC+ meeting due Thursday, when major oil prices are expected to stick with plans to raise production gradually by 400,000 barrels per month despite pressure to ramp-up output.
Materials racked up gains led by a more than 12% gain in FMC (NYSE:FMC) after the agricultural science company reported than expected results following its better-than-expected third-quarter results reported Tuesday after the closing bell.

(Reuters) - A proposed cap on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients would improve patient access, but allowing the U.S. government health plan for seniors to negotiate prices could limit innovation,  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) Chief Executive Robert Bradway said in an interview.
""We need to make sure to be very careful not to destroy the very system which is bringing forward the innovation we need,"" Bradway said in an interview ahead of the Reuters Total Health conference, which will run virtually from Nov. 15-18. 
The latest legislation proposed by congressional Democrats and the Biden administration would give the federal government the ability for the first time to negotiate prices for a limited number of drugs paid for by Medicare.
Conventional prescription drugs would be protected from negotiation for the first nine years after they are launched, while biologic drugs, which are made from living cells, would be protected for 12 years.
The agreement would also set a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients and limit annual price increases to the rate of inflation.
""We're going to look favorably on anything that improves access,"" Bradway said.
But he warned that allowing the government to ""negotiate or in effect set prices,"" runs the risk of ""artificial distortions in the market with the effect that innovators will have to decide whether to reallocate capital away from the drug sector.""
Bradway said more also needs to be known about the Biden administration's efforts to agree with other nations on a multinational corporate tax rate. 
A group of 136 countries, including the United States, last month set a goal for a minimum global tax rate of 15% for big companies - well below the current average of 23.5% in industrialized countries.

""It will be important if the U.S. wants to continue to be the epicenter of innovation for the U.S. to remain competitive,"" Bradway said. ""Otherwise, we'll see what has been happening for years, which is investors from outside the United States acquiring innovative technology and basing that technology in lower tax jurisdictions.""
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California, is one of the world's largest makers of biotechnology drugs, including treatments for cancer, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>","Canadian employers shed unvaccinated workers, labor lawyers in demand","By Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian employers are firing or putting on unpaid leave thousands of workers who refused to get COVID-19 shots, squeezing an already tight labor market and raising prospects of potentially disruptive legal challenges.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/unvaccinated-federal-workers-canada-will-be-put-unpaid-leave-globe-mail-2021-10-06 vaccine mandates as a central part of his successful campaign for re-election in September, setting a precedent that has spread from the public to the private sector. 
The mandate for federal workers is one of the world's strictest, and the government has extended it to federally regulated spaces, which include airports, and to air and rail travelers. 
Across Canada, hospitals, banks, insurers, school boards, police and some provincial administrations are now implementing https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/more-canadian-businesses-will-embrace-vaccine-mandates-workers-minister-2021-08-25 similar policies for current and future hires.
Unvaccinated workers whose livelihoods are on the line - in a country where more than 83% of the eligible population over 12 years old have had their shots - are flooding labor lawyers with calls. 
Air Canada and WestJet airlines alone, where well over 90% of staff are vaccinated, are suspending hundreds who are not, and demanding that new hires get inoculated. Toronto transit agencies are likewise putting hundreds on unpaid leave and reducing some services.
Ottawa Hospital, the capital's largest and where more than 99% of staff are fully vaccinated, put on unpaid leave 186 people who failed to prove they were. Services will not be cut, however, said spokeswoman Michaela Schreiter.
While the unvaccinated have some hopes of collecting severance pay or employment insurance, the legal advice that many are getting is that simply not wanting the shot is not grounds for a lawsuit.
""Most people are really unhappy because they want to ... force the employer to change the policy,"" said Paul Champ of Champ & Associates in Ottawa, whose firm has fielded 20 to 30 calls a day from unvaccinated workers. ""I've been very clear to people that that's not going to be successful."" 
Only strict religious or medical exemptions are being accepted by most employers, who have a right to impose health and safety conditions in the workplace, Champ said.
JOBS SQUEEZE
However, to avoid losing thousands of nurses and other medical staff and being forced to cut services, the Quebec provincial government on Wednesday dropped its previously announced inoculation requirement for healthcare workers, and Ontario said it would not introduce one.
""Implementing a province-wide vaccine mandate for hospital workers can negatively impact the care patients receive,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a statement, underscoring the way the mandates can exacerbate a labor shortage. 
Some 64% of firms say they are facing more intense labor shortages https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-wage-inflation-looms-perfect-storm-hits-labor-market-2021-10-28 than a year ago, which are preventing more businesses from meeting growing demand, the Bank of Canada said last month.
The jobs market will face added pressure beginning Nov. 15, when as many as 20,000 unvaccinated federal workers - out of some 300,000 - are due to be put on unpaid leave.
""Departments and agencies will assess operational needs ... and are focused on ensuring that there is no noticeable impact on service,"" said Genevieve Sicard, a spokeswoman at Canada's Treasury Board, which oversees the civil service.
The Treasury Board said it had no knowledge of a legal challenge yet, though that seems only a matter of time.
""There are a lot of people willing to take this to the end because they can see the loss of one person's rights are a loss of everyone's rights,"" said Stacey Payne, founder of Feds for Freedom, a group of federal employees who say the mandates infringe on their privacy and freedom.
Unions could have some success in challenging vaccine mandates for people who work from home and do not interact with others, said Daniel Lublin, founding partner of Whitten & Lublin in Toronto.
The mandates are ""a one-size-fits-all approach,"" he said. ""... And the problem I have with that is that Canadian employment laws always look at context.""

Workers also have a legal argument for severance pay or for employment insurance, lawyers said. Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough has argued that those who lose their jobs because they refuse to get vaccinated should not collect employment insurance.
""A lot of people were playing this out to the wire to see if companies were actually going to fire them,"" said Lublin. ""If they do get fired, I do think that they're going to fight it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday said it had approved Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access.
Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low earth orbit satellites. The FCC did not approve Boeing’s request to operate inter-satellite links in certain frequency bands that are not allocated internationally for operations of the fixed-satellite service.
There is a growing effort to deploy satellite-based internet service.
In 2019, Elon Musk's SpaceX urged the FCC to reject Boeing's plan saying it presented a ""clear danger of harmful interference"" to other systems or ""at a minimum impose appropriate conditions to ensure that Boeing’s operations do not harm those of other"" operators.
In April, the FCC voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet.
SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2,824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.
In July 2020, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would invest more than $10 billion to build a network of 3,236 low-earth orbit satellites.
On Monday Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites.

SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly $10 billion.
While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.

Investing.com -- Stocks paused earlier Wednesday and then shot higher after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and announced it would begin to cut back on its monthly bond purchases, an acknowledgement that the U.S. economy was well on its way to recovery.
But Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that challenges remain.
The Fed will start cutting back on its bond purchases little by little starting this month, aiming to be done by sometime next year. Powell repeated his oft-cited mantra that price increases would be “transitory” and won’t require swift changes to interest rates.
But the Fed pointed to global supply difficulties, saying they would need to ease in order for prices to drop.
""As the pandemic subsides, supply-chain bottlenecks will abate and job growth will move back up,"" Powell said during a news conference. ""And as that happens, inflation will decline from today's elevated levels. Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain.""

 Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER)’s revenue in the third quarter is seen at $4.42 billion with loss per share expected to come in at 34 cents. But fellow ride-hailing company  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) reported a good return in demand for the quarter, so analysts will be looking to see how Uber did.
2. Airbnb earnings
Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) is expected to report a third-quarter profit per share of 72 cents on revenue of $2.06 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Analysts want to hear how the holiday travel season is shaping up in terms of bookings.
3. Square earnings
 Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ)’s third-quarter revenue is likely to be $4.38 billion with profit per share seen coming in at 36 cents.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>",Top U.S. financial regulator reverses stance on social issues,"By Katanga Johnson and Ross Kerber
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday published new staff guidance that may make it harder for corporations to keep shareholder proposals on matters like workforce diversity or climate from being voted on at annual meetings.
The new bulletins replace Trump-era guidance that gave companies more room to toss proposals on hot-button social issues, changes critics said had aimed to silence investors' voices.
Among other changes, staff now will give more consideration to the social policy significance of a shareholder proposal and will recognize ""that proposals seeking detail or seeking to promote timeframes or methods do not per se constitute micromanagement,"" or grounds for exclusion, said the bulletin published by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance.
""The right to put proposals in front of other shareholders for a vote is an important part of the securities laws,"" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement. 
""Today’s bulletin will provide greater clarity to companies and shareholders on these matters, so they can better understand when exclusions may or may not apply,"" he said.
Shareholder voting rights have become a major bone of contention as more investors have pushed companies to take up social and environmental issues, and drawn more support from top investment firms.
Under agency rules, shareholders who want to bring a proposal for a vote must first submit it for a company's proxy statement - months before the annual meeting itself - and companies often seek agency permission to skip the proposal. Separate SEC rule changes from 2020 that raised the share ownership needed to file a resolution remain in place but face litigation.
Sanford Lewis, director of the Shareholder Rights Group, which represents socially-minded investment firms that often file proposals, praised Wednesday's changes. 
“They have taken away a bunch of burdensome interpretations that made it harder, more uncertain and more expensive for shareholders to file proposals,” he said in an interview.

The two Republican appointees on the five-member commission, Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman, said in a joint statement that ""The rationale for today’s action is a bit of a mystery,"" with the practical effects of the changes unclear.
Sorting out which proposals can be excluded from company proxies ""has long been an insatiable consumer of staff time"" at the agency, the two commissioners wrote, adding that the new bulletin ""does not make their jobs easier.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 hit fresh record highs Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve's announced its plan to taper its monthly bond purchases later this month, and downplayed market expectations of sooner rather than later rate hikes. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.13% and hit an earlier all-time high of 4,656.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%, or 67 points to a record of 36,141.72. The Nasdaq climbed 0.88%, and had earlier notched a record of 15,792.6.
The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday detailed plans to begin scaling back asset purchases later this month, with a view to ending its bond-buying program by June next year.
The monthly bond purchases of $120 billion -- $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities – would be trimmed by $15 billion a month.
In the press conference that followed the monetary policy, Fed chairman Jerome Powell downplayed the potential for sooner rather than later rate hikes. 
""[W]e don't think it's a good time to raise interest rates because we want to see the labour market heal further,"" Powell said. [W]e have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines."" Powell added that he sees inflation moving down by third or fourth quarter.
Growth sectors of the market including tech, which are sensitive to rate hikes, were sharply higher. 
Big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were higher.
Following of the decision, Treasury yields added modest gains, with the United States 10-Year yield trading at 1.6%.
Industrials were also in the red paced by a decline in Deere (NYSE:DE) and Generac.
Generac (NYSE:GNRC) slumped more than 6% after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the energy technology solutions provider to neutral from buy, citing valuation concerns.
The bank said that while it was ""difficult"" to pull its buy rating on the stock following the company's ""overwhelming"" growth rates, at some point valuation has to matter.
Energy, meanwhile, also weighed on upside momentum in the broader market, paced by a decline in oil prices following a bigger-than-expected increase in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles. 
Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) were down more than 2%.
The fall in oil prices comes just a day ahead of OPEC+ meeting due Thursday, when major oil prices are expected to stick with plans to raise production gradually by 400,000 barrels per month despite pressure to ramp-up output.
Materials racked up gains led by 12% gain in FMC (NYSE:FMC) after the agricultural science company reported than expected results following its better-than-expected third-quarter results reported Tuesday after the closing bell.
In IPO news,   Allbirds  (NASDAQ:BIRD) made its public market debut in style as the shoe maker surged more than 60% well above its IPO price of $15  per share.
On the economic front, U.S. services activity swelled to a record last month, driven by a further reopening of the service sector.
""The surge in the index sends a positive signal about the post-Delta economy,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note. ""The bad news is that the supply-chain indicators - supplier delivery times, prices paid, and the order backlog - all materially worsened, with all three hitting new highs."""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) whistleblower Frances Haugen welcomed Facebook's announcement that it would scrap facial recognition, but urged close government oversight of the move to ensure the social network lived up to its pledge.
Facebook made the announcement on Tuesday, partly in response to growing scrutiny from regulators and legislators over user safety and abuses on its platforms. Activists have criticised faceprinting as a serious threat to privacy.
""I strongly encourage government oversight,"" Haugen said.
""When they say we've got rid of this, what does that actually mean,"" she asked. ""There has to be more transparency on how these operations work to make sure they actually follow through.""
Ahead of a meeting with Germany's justice minister, the whistleblower, who leaked a trove of damaging documents about Facebook's inner workings, added that the European Union's and Britain's ""principles-based"" regulation was more effective in constraining technology companies than the United States's more rigid rules-based approach.
Europe also had a particular role to play in ensuring Facebook improves its monitoring of content in languages other than English.

Facebook has faced criticism for failing to act against hate speech in languages from Burmese to Greek even as it steps up its monitoring of English-language posts in the wake of the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
""A linguistically diverse place like Europe can be an advocate for everybody around the world that doesn't speak English,"" she said. ""The reality is that Facebook has radically under-invested in safety and security systems for all languages other than English.""

Directed Share Programs (DSPs), which Robinhood refers to as its ""friends and family"" offering, allows employees, customers, vendors, or others who have a relationship with the issuing company an opportunity to buy shares at the IPO price. 
As part of the DSP program, the company reserves a portion of IPO shares for a specific group of people and Robinhood helps distribute these shares to those select individuals. 
In May, the popular online brokerage unveiled the IPO Access offering, which gives retail investors the opportunity to buy shares in IPOs.
Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been the first in line for allocations on IPOs, as the investment banks that control share allocations typically prioritize deep-pocketed Wall Street clients.
That typically leaves most retail investors with no option but to buy into stock of a newly listed company only after its shares start trading - which often means paying a higher price. 
Through its new platform, Robinhood works with Wall Street investment banks to get allocations for retail investors.

Robinhood has partnered with 12 companies that have made their IPOs available to its customers, as of October 31.
Its latest offering will make IPO shares accessible to an even bigger pool of retail investors.

(Reuters) - U.S. shale producer Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) on Wednesday said it was increasing its 2021 total oil production forecast to between 24.5 million and 26.5 million barrels, a jump of 1 million barrels from earlier guidance. 
The uptick in output is largely the result of lower base production declines, the company said. It expects to produce between 20 million and 22 million barrels next year, according to a presentation. 
Shares of Chesapeake were up about 0.8% in afternoon trading to $66.20. Benchmark U.S. crude futures were off about 3.6% to $80.88 a barrel.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based Chesapeake anticipates running roughly the same number of rigs next year, with plans to operate one to three rigs in south Texas next year, and two to three rigs in Appalachia, according to the presentation. The company will run five to six active rigs at its Gulf Coast operations, the company said. 
Rival  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN)'s third quarter production volumes came in 5% above guidance, the company said this week. Both Chesapeake and Devon said they were able to lift production without raising spending, heeding calls from investors to focus on returns over growth.

Executives for Devon warned the industry would continue to bump into rising prices for goods and services and that it had baked up to 15% inflation into its financial projections for its exploration and production operations.
Shares of Devon were up 0.23% on Wednesday afternoon at $42.08.

The deal follows Gap's strategic review last year of its European business to cut costs, while maintaining a presence.
In September, Gap struck a deal with British clothing retailer Next, which will run the U.S. group's business in the UK and Ireland. 
The retailer has also reached an agreement for Hermione People & Brands to run its stores in France.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>",Intesa to spruce up for new plan after meeting profit goal early,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) said it would get in top shape for a new business plan due in February by offloading problem loans, after meeting its 2021 profit target ahead of time.
Italy's biggest bank by assets failed to markedly lift its full-year goal after lower loan losses and a higher trading income drove quarterly earnings above market expectations.
Intesa indicated instead it would use the money to write down loans in the final quarter of the year, when it will focus on preparing for a new business plan.
""I want to enter into the new business plan with zero (problems) related to ... nonperforming loans,"" Chief Executive Carlo Messina told analysts.
Under the current four-year plan Intesa has shed 34 billion euros ($39.37 billion) in impaired loans, surpassing its goal by 8 billion euros.
Exposure to the country's myriad small businesses and Italy's chronically stagnating economy have made soured loans the Achilles' heel of Italian banks.
In the third quarter, provisions at Intesa fell a larger-than-expected 44% from 2020, when the bank put aside nearly 1 billion euros to prepare for future damage on its loan book from COVID-19.
NORDIC BANK
Messina noted the outlook was now different thanks to the strong post-COVID rebound for which Italy was poised, helped by the boost from European Union recovery funds.
""We'll continue to work ... to create a starting point to the new plan that can allow us to be really a Nordic bank in terms of provisions,"" he said, referring to banks known for their low ratios for problem loans. 
Net profit in the January-September period totalled 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion), matching the minimum goal Intesa had set for the year, which it now expects to surpass.
""A solid set of results but ... may not be enough to push the stock on from here,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said, noting Intesa's shares, unlike those of several peers, offer no discount compared with the value of the bank's assets.
Shares closed down 0.4% against a 0.6% rise in the banking index, a performance attributed by Messina to the relatively expensive valuation of the company's shares.
""We're one of the best banks in Europe and investors expect a lot of us,"" he said.
Intesa's earnings confirmed the encouraging picture for the sector painted by rivals such as France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) https://www.reuters.com/business/bnp-beats-q3-expectations-launches-900-mln-euro-share-buyback-2021-10-29, Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/bbvas-q3-net-profit-rises-227-launches-35-bln-buy-back-2021-10-29 and Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/britains-lloyds-reports-q3-profit-beats-expectations-2021-10-28 - whose results were also boosted by either shrinking provisions or the release of cash set aside against COVID-driven loan losses.
The less severe than expected fallout from the pandemic so far has allowed European banks like BBVA, BNP and HSBA to announce share buybacks, an option which Messina said Intesa could consider under the new plan.
However, Intesa would first set a new payout goal and a minimum capital buffer to hold on top of regulatory thresholds.
Intesa, whose share price draws support from the bank's high dividend yield, confirmed a 70% payout ratio over 2021 results, down from 75% this year.
Third-quarter net profit came in at 983 million euros, well above a Reuters-compiled consensus of 850 million euros.
Revenue totalled 5.09 billion euros, above the expected 4.93 billion euros, thanks mostly to a strong performance from trading activities, where income tripled year-on-year.
Income from the lending business fell 6.1% annually due to negative interest rates, compounded by tough competition and slowing credit growth in Italy after a boom fuelled by state guarantees.
Messina said, however, that companies were resuming investments and this would drive lending going forward.
Net fees rose 8.3% year-on-year thanks to robust commercial banking and asset management activity in the post-lockdown months.

Intesa said its board had approved paying a 1.4 billion euro cash interim dividend on Nov. 24, bringing the dividend yield for the year to 8.3%.

Read on.Since governments worldwide have been taking several steps to transition their nations to a renewable energy-based future, it’s no surprise that solar energy has been at the forefront of the revolution, given its relatively lower storage costs. Investors’ optimism about the solar industry’s growth prospects is evidenced by the Invesco Solar ETF’s (TAN) 23.5% gains over the past month compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 6.8% returns.
Furthermore, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) recently announced its one-of-a-kind DEIJ Certification Program that aims to provide training and support for companies to analyze their DEIJ practices.

Because countries worldwide are gearing up to achieve zero-emission targets, analysts expect global EV market share to be in the 7%-10% range in 2021.
However, insufficient EV charging infrastructures could limit the industry’s growth.

In comparison, approximately 30 ports were installed per day on an average in the U.S. between 2010 - 2020. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions are expected to weigh on the industry’s production capabilities, owing mainly to the semiconductor shortage, which could extend into 2022 and beyond.

CVS in August https://reut.rs/3BBWfXf had hedged a bit on its long-term target for double digit earnings growth for 2022, pointing to uncertainty around medical costs and COVID-19 testing and vaccine demand.
CVS's third-quarter profits were weighed down by higher medical costs in its Aetna (NYSE:AET) insurance businesses due to the pandemic, CVS executives said on the call. However, that was offset by higher pharmacy sales, which have benefited from demand for COVID-19 vaccines and tests.

U.S. prosecutors in Manhattan said Joseph James O'Connor, 22, and his accomplices stole bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin after gaining control of victims' cellphone numbers by linking them to subscriber identity module cards, or SIM cards.
O'Connor, also known as PlugwalkJoe, and his accomplices conducted so-called SIM swap attacks targeting three executives of a Manhattan cryptocurrency company, stole cryptocurrency from two clients, and laundered what they stole, prosecutors said.
A lawyer for O'Connor could not immediately be identified. Prosecutors said the scheme ran from March to May 2019.
O'Connor has been awaiting possible extradition from Spain following his July 21 arrest https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-citizen-arrested-spain-role-2020-twitter-hack-2021-07-21 concerning a July 2020 hacking that compromised dozens of Twitter accounts and allegedly netted more than $118,000 of bitcoin.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus's new defence chief pointed on Wednesday to more sales of military transporters after deals in Kazakhstan and India and reaffirmed support for a new European fighter.
""I am confident that there will be more good news this year in terms of (transporter) business wins,"" Michael Schoellhorn, chief executive of Airbus Defence & Space, told reporters.
In September, India finalised the purchase of 56 C295 transporters, including 40 to be assembled in India.
Also that month, Kazakhstan ordered two Airbus A400M airlifters, becoming only the second confirmed export customer some 16 years after Malaysia ordered the transporter in 2005.
South Africa cancelled an order in 2009 and a planned order from Chile did not materialise as what was then Europe's largest defence project plunged into heavy cost overruns and delays.
Schoellhorn, a former German military helicopter pilot who took over Airbus's second-largest division in July after joining the group as chief operating officer in 2019, pledged to draw lessons from delays and overruns on the A400M for new projects.
""Let's really learn from that and do it right from the get-go,"" he told the AJPAE aerospace media association. 
Schoellhorn said Airbus remained fully committed to the Franco-German-Spanish FCAS fighter plane as Airbus and Dassault Aviation work out final details of an industrial agreement, to be followed by a detailed accord with buyers.
""We are optimistic and fully committed to making this work,"" he said of the plan to replace Eurofighter and Rafale warplanes.
But he warned the long-delayed Eurodrone project was the last chance for Europe to wean itself off U.S. and Israeli drone technology after a series of false starts in unmanned vehicles.
LAST EXIT
The plan for a medium-altitude, long-endurance drone for France, Germany, Italy and Spain is technically ready and waiting for countries to sign off, he said.

Colombia's flag carrier had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at a U.S. court in New York in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. It now expects to exit the measure by the end 2021, after receiving around $2 billion in new financing under a debt-for-equity deal.
Once its principle domicile is established in the UK, the company will be known as Avianca Group International Ltd. Its current shareholders will not receive any payout or be included as shareholders in Avianca Group, the airline added.
The airline did not say why it was moving its domicile, or why it had chosen Britain. 

Colombia's stock exchange on Wednesday suspended trading in Avianca shares, which had closed at 42.5 pesos (0.01 dollar cents) each on Tuesday. Avianca said it expected its Columbian listing to be canceled.
Avianca's approved business plan includes all parts of its operation, including destinations it will serve, the planes it will operate, and the way it will serve customers.

(Reuters) - Eco-friendly sneaker maker Allbirds Inc fetched a valuation of $3.3 billion in its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday after its shares opened 41% above their offer price, joining a clutch of retailers that had strong market debuts in recent months.
Allbirds, which is backed by Leonardo DiCaprio, uses wool and other plant-based alternatives in its products. Barack Obama, Ashton Kutcher and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Larry Page have been spotted wearing Allbirds sneakers in recent years.
""We believe that there's an opportunity to unlock growth and financial opportunity for a business by also having very good impact on the environment"", said Joseph Zwillinger, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Allbirds.
In its prospectus earlier, Allbirds announced a set of ESG criteria called the ""Sustainability Principles and Objectives (SPO) Framework"". An independent third party then assessed the company against these criteria and found that it was compliant, Allbirds said.
The company later halved the number of references to the ""SPO framework"" in an amended filing, but Zwillinger said those were just ""semantic"" changes. 
""Companies like Allbirds that focus on the ESG factors that are critical to their business and operations will have a competitive advantage in competing for capital, as well as customers and talent,"" said Suz Mac Cormac, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster, who was part of the council that designed the framework.
Shares of the company opened at $21.21 each, compared with the IPO price of $15. It sold about 20.2 million shares in its upsized offering, along with certain existing investors, to raise nearly $303 million.

Other retailers like medical scrubs maker FIGS Inc and eyewear company Warby Parker Inc have also seen strong market debuts in the United States this year as the IPO market continues on its bullish course.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters.

And Wall Street analysts expect quality mega-cap stocks Visa (V),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to deliver solid returns in the coming months. So, let’s discuss these names.Mega-cap stocks are considered the safest bets amid market volatility because the size and strength of these companies help them to endure market downturns better than their smaller-cap brethren. Due to their traditional, low-risk nature, mega-cap stocks are trusted by most investors. Indeed, investors’ interest in mega-cap stocks is evidenced by Vanguard Mega Cap Index Fund ETF’s (MGC) 6.4% returns over the past month and 23% gain year-to-date.
Even though the third-quarter earnings season has been impressive so far, and the stock market moved higher in response, concerns over high inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the Fed’s monetary policy tightening are expected to keep the market volatile in the near term. As investors brace for the Federal Reserve's tapering decision today, stock futures trading was mixed this morning.
Wall Street analysts expect popular mega-cap stocks  Visa Inc . (NYSE:V), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) to rally by more than 30% in price in the near term. So, we think it could be worth adding these stocks to one’s watchlist.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 01:26PM ET</span>",Rothermere family agree deal to take Daily Mail publisher private,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) -The publisher of the Daily Mail said on Wednesday its founder and controlling shareholder, the Rothermere family, had agreed to the terms to take the company private, comprising a cash, dividends and shares offer valued at 1,263 pence a share.
The Rothermeres announced their plan to buy out other shareholders in July, with the move dependent on the sale of the company's insurance business, Risk Management Solutions, and a listing of online car seller Cazoo, which it partly owns.
Both conditions have now been fulfilled.
Under the terms of the offer, shareholders will receive 255 pence in cash, a special dividend of 568 pence and 0.5749 Cazoo shares for each share.
The value of the offer is slightly higher than indicated in July, and represents a 21.5% premium to the closing price of the stock on the day before the plan was announced.
However one large investor, Majedie Asset Management, said the offer was ""substantially below"" what it believes is a fair and reasonable valuation. 
The Daily Mail was first published in 1896 by the ancestors of DMGT chairman Jonathan Harmsworth, the Viscount Rothermere.
He said DMGT was a considerably smaller business following the sale of RMS and the listing of Cazoo, with significantly greater exposure to consumer media.
""We believe the terms of our offer to be fair, particularly bearing in mind not only the existing level of debt within DMGT at a time of increasingly difficult market conditions, but also the restrictions imposed on the operation of the business as part of the settlement with the pension trustees,"" he said.
DMGT's liquidity has been constrained by its dual-share structure, with voting rights only granted to some stock, tightening the family's hold on the company.
The Rothermeres and their associates control 30.3% of the A shares and all of the ordinary shares.

Chris Field, a fund manager at Majedie, said non-family shareholders did not have as much information as the Rothermeres. Majedie owns 4.6% of DMGT A shares on behalf of its clients. 
""Our appraised valuation estimate of only the largest businesses within DMGT materially exceeds double the current offer price of 255 pence,"" he said in a statement. ""We strongly urge shareholders not to accept the offer.""

(Reuters) - European shares finished at a record high on Wednesday following a strong batch of quarterly earnings, while heavyweight mining stocks recovered from recent losses as commodity prices rose. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.4% to a record-high close of 481.22 points, with basic resources stocks leading gains. The sector added 0.9%, recovering from a near one-month low. 
In earnings news, German software firm TeamViewer jumped 11.0% after it confirmed its preliminary third-quarter results and annual outlook.
Lufthansa jumped 7.0% after the airline posted a return to profit for the first time since the coronavirus crisis, boosted by the easing of travel restrictions. 
Raiffeisen Bank International rose 10.9% after its quarterly net profit blew past estimates on strong revenues and lower provisions.
Still, anticipation of an announcement on stimulus tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve kept most stock gains in check. 
""Hopes of a reacceleration in growth, a pullback in real bond yields, and a supportive earnings season in Europe, which has come in above the historical average, are contributing to the renewed market rally,"" said Milla Savova, European equity strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Savova, however, warned the recovery will prove short lived as major central banks consider scaling back on pandemic-era stimulus.
The STOXX 600 kicked off November with consecutive record highs as investors looked past concerns about rising inflation caused by supply-chain bottlenecks and labour shortages, with earnings season proving to be much stronger than expected.
Profits for Europe Inc are expected to jump 57.2% in the third quarter to 102.3 billion euros ($118.5 billion) from the same quarter last year, new Refinitiv IBES data showed, an improvement from last week's 52% growth forecast.

The service closed in 2014 after the government passed a rule that forced Alphabet and other news aggregators to pay a collective licensing fee to republish headlines or snippets of news.
""Starting early next year, Google News will provide links to useful and relevant news stories,"" Google Spain Country Manager Fuencisla Clemares wrote on a company blog. 
""Over the coming months, we will be working with publishers to reach agreements which cover their rights under the new law,"" he added.
The Spanish government on Tuesday approved a European Union copyright directive that allows third-party online news platforms to negotiate directly with content providers.
The EU legislation, which must be adopted by all member states, requires platforms such as Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and others to share revenue with publishers but it also removes the collective fee and allows them to reach individual or group agreements with publishers.
The debate over Google News had pitched traditional media, who backed the old system, against a new breed of online outlets, who expected more revenues from direct agreements with Alphabet and the other platforms than through their share of the collective fee.

Arsenio Escolar, chairman of the CLABE publishers association, which groups around 1,000 mainly online news outlets including leading digital brands such as El Espanol and Eldiario.es, said he was pleased with the new legislation.
The AMI media association, which represents mainly the old guard of traditional media and was in favour of maintaining the previous system declined to comment on the government's decision.

The company, which did not disclose its investment amount, said its program would include training local publishers from diverse backgrounds to drive their digital audience and revenue growth, both on and off Facebook. 
Meta also said it would partner with the International Center for Journalists to set up an advisory panel comprising five Kiwi media personnel who will help develop talent selected under the program.

The move comes just days after an Australian academic publisher urged the government to enforce a new law to compel Facebook to negotiate a content deal, as it did with other large media companies such as News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
Last week, Facebook changed the name of its holding company to Meta, undergoing a rebranding at a time when lawmakers and regulators have criticised its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish electric self-driving truck start-up Einride said on Wednesday it has launched operations in the U.S. market and signed up GE Appliances, Swedish vegan milk maker and Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) and tiremaker Bridgestone as customers.
The company has already started operating a fleet of 20 Einride Pods - its electric self-driving truck without a driver cabin - at the Louisville headquarters of GE Appliances, a unit of Chinese home appliance maker Haier, which includes a sprawling manufacturing complex.
Einride chief executive Robert Falck told Reuters for now the company's trucks would operate inside customers' facilities, which allows them to operate without the need for a backup human driver as they are on private property.
The company is working with U.S. regulators to ""take this outside the fence and operate on public roads as well"".
""There is huge potential for automation and electrification in the U.S. market and the next step for us scale up with our customers,"" he said.
The Swedish start-up has raised $150 million from investors, including a $110 million funding round announced in May.
Einride's European customers include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Electrolux.
Self-driving technology for freight trucks has attracted investor attention as it should be easier and cheaper to roll out than in self-driving cars and robotaxis, while providing a clearer path to profitability.
Self-driving freight services run on fixed routes between predefined points - mostly on major highways without intersections or pedestrians - requiring less mapping than shuttling customers between random points in robotaxis.

Einride also said it has hired its first remote truck driver who can take over control of the autonomous trucks in particular situations that require human interaction or human decision-making capabilities. 
That first driver will be based in the United States.

Investing.com –  Lyft  stock (NASDAQ:LYFT) jumped 8% Wednesday as the ride-hailing company finally stepped aside pandemic woes to report higher adjusted profit during the September quarter and said the same would be higher in the current quarter.
At one time, the stock was up 15%, the most in about a year, after dropping for five consecutive weeks. Rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) was up about 6%. It will report its third-quarter numbers on Thursday.
Rising vaccinations and the reopening of economies helped the company swing to an adjusted quarterly profit of $17.8 million on revenue of $864.4 million, up 73% over last year.
The company had made an adjusted net loss of $280.4 million in last year’s third quarter.
Rides to airports, among the most profitable routes, nearly tripled from a year ago, a Reuters report said quoting company executives. Lyft said it is also seeing a rise in weekend and evening trips, a sign that consumers are now more confident about riding in a vehicle used by others as well.
Overall, Lyft’s active riders increased 11% to 18.9 million in the quarter ended September 30. But ridership remains 35% below peak levels before the pandemic, with Lyft executives saying many consumers were waiting for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, according to Reuters.

BEIJING (Reuters) - ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has stepped down as chairman of the TikTok owner, after saying in May he would step down as CEO, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, in the latest shake up at the tech giant. 
New CEO Liang Rubo has taken over as chairman of the company's five-person board, which also includes General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, Coatue Management, and Susquehanna International Group, the person said, adding that the decision was made this year. 
It was not immediately clear when Zhang relinquished the chairman title and whether there have been any changes to his more than 50% voting rights at the company. 
ByteDance said in May that Zhang would move to a ""key strategy"" position at the end of the year. The person said that plan was unchanged. ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zhang 's surprise announcement in May saw his college roommate and co-founder Liang take the lead in navigating the company through a rising wave of new regulations targeting Big Tech. 
The move comes after the company on Tuesday announced a major organisational reshuffle at ByteDance to create six business units. It also said that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew would step down as its parent ByteDance's chief financial officer (CFO) to focus on running the short video platform full time.
A number of founders at some of China's most well-known tech companies have in recent months given up overseeing daily operations amid a wide-ranging clampdown by Chinese regulators on large swathes of the economy. 

Last week, short-video apps owner Kuaishou said its co-founder, Su Hua, had stepped down as CEO. 
E-commerce company  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) founder Huang Zheng stepped down as chairman this year, having earlier relinquished his CEO title.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma retired as chairman of the e-commerce giant in 2019.
