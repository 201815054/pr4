(Reuters) -European stocks sank to their lowest in a week on Tuesday as a surge in government bond yields knocked high-growth technology shares, with fresh signs of a slowdown in China's economy weighing on investor sentiment.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 2.2%, its biggest one-day decline in over two months as a jump in U.S. Treasury yields signalled that investors were bracing for higher rates and the risk of persistent inflation. [US/]
Technology stocks fell 4.8% to hit their lowest in two months after their Wall Street peers continued to sell off. They are particularly sensitive to rising interest rate expectations as their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when rates go up. (N)
Meanwhile, data showed profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for a sixth month in August, with an unfolding power crisis becoming a growing threat to output and profits. 
""The pandemic situation remains unresolved. The Chinese economy is slowing and authorities have yet to stimulate forcefully. The Fed is preparing to normalise policy. And the debt ceiling showdown is ongoing,"" analysts at BCA Research wrote in a note.
""Heightened uncertainty combined with elevated speculation suggests that the near-term path will be bumpy.""
The weak sentiment across markets overshadowed a survey that showed the mood among German consumers brightened unexpectedly heading into October.
Germany's DAX fell 2.1%, France's CAC 40 was down 2.2% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.5%.
While the benchmark STOXX 600 is on course to extend its quarterly winning run, a volatile September took some shine off its third-quarter gains as investors priced in risks of easing global growth momentum and tighter monetary policies.
European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said on Monday inflation in the euro zone could exceed its already raised projections, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would move against unchecked inflation if needed.
""We now think that euro zone headline inflation will soon hit 4% and that it will average 2% in 2022. But headline and core inflation still look set to fall over the course of next year, with both settling at uncomfortably low levels for the ECB,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. 
However, a rally in Brent crude futures above $80 per barrel continued to support energy stocks, with the oil and gas index rising 0.3% to fresh highs since February 2020. [O/R]

Swiss computer peripherals maker Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) slid 7.3% as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the stock to ""underweight"".

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co on Tuesday became the second Detroit automaker to ask U.S. salaried employees to reveal their vaccination status against COVID-19 in a bid to comply with wider federal guidelines.
Ford said salaried employees were required to submit their vaccination status against COVID-19 by Oct. 8 but the process was voluntary for its hourly employees represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
The automaker's move comes as the Biden administration pursues sweeping measures to increase vaccination coverage in the United States, while pushing large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly.
Separately, Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a CNBC interview that the company's leadership team was vaccinated against COVID-19 and that Ford was conducting a survey to know how many employees had been vaccinated.
""When it comes to the larger population of Ford, we want people to get vaccinated,"" Farley said, adding the company would work with UAW, which had so far resisted the effort to make vaccinations compulsory.
UAW represented about 58,000 hourly employees in the United States, as per the company's latest annual filing.
Larger rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in August had asked for vaccination status of its salaried employees.
CHIP SHORTAGE
Farley, in the CNBC interview, also said the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage would probably last through the end of next year.
He said things were getting better but Ford was still unable to meet demand for its vehicles.

""We are improving our shipments to dealers now and our inventories are going very fast,"" said Farley, who took over the automaker's reins last year.
Ford's production was hit in the second quarter due to a fire at a plant owned by automobile chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp in March. Farley said the facility was up to speed now.

The electric vehicle maker, which began construction in the town of Grunheide in December 2019 but is still awaiting final approval for its site, announced in August it would hold an event on Oct. 9 to let locals see the factory in construction.
Its outspoken boss, Elon Musk, tweeted earlier this month he would attend.
Local authorities told Reuters the company had applied for permission to have 9,000 people on-site, beyond pandemic rules which limit such gatherings to 5,000.
""The documents available suggest that the application will be approved,"" a spokesperson for the local authorities said, confirming an earlier report by newspaper B.Z.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
To host the event, Tesla must also prove it will not damage the land or release toxic substances into the groundwater - a topic which has held up construction on the grounds for months.
It is also expected the firm will meet this requirement, the local authorities spokesperson said.
Tesla's chosen site borders a water protection area, and environmental groups have expressed concern the factory could contaminate and over-use its groundwater sources.

Musk has said the factory will use less water than other industrial projects in the region, and that Tesla's plans include measures such as a water recycling facility to ensure it does not strip locals of their drinking water.
A website set up to register for the event says the day will involve a ""behind the scenes"" factory tour and the opportunity to ride in a Model Y, the car that will be produced on-site if the factory is approved.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",Analysis-Huawei CFO's admissions likely won't help U.S. in case against company,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) -The admission by Huawei's chief financial officer that she misled a bank about the company's business dealings in Iran likely won't help the United States as it continues to prosecute Huawei for the same charges.
While Meng Wanzhou's admissions last week https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-court-expected-reach-agreement-with-us-source-2021-09-24 go to the heart of the financial fraud charges, legal experts say it will be difficult and perhaps impossible for prosecutors to use them against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd at trial.
And if the government were to try to use her admissions as leverage in any negotiations aimed at avoiding a trial, experts said, Huawei would likely say what she admitted was the result of extortion, or even a fabrication.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment, as did a Huawei spokeswoman. 
A U.S. judge in Brooklyn on Friday accepted a deferred prosecution agreement between Meng and U.S. prosecutors to end the case against her. Meng appeared via video from Canada, where she had been fighting extradition since her arrest in 2018 on a U.S. warrant.
Meng's arrest was a key source of discord between Beijing and Washington https://www.reuters.com/world/china/white-house-xi-raised-case-huawei-cfo-recent-call-with-biden-2021-09-27, and also had repercussions for Canada. Within hours of the U.S. agreement and Meng's release, two Canadians who were detained shortly after Meng was taken into custody were freed from Chinese jails and flown home.
As part of the agreement, Meng acknowledged that Huawei controlled a company that operated in Iran, that its employees were Huawei employees, and that she had made false statements about the company at a 2013 meeting with an executive at a global bank, earlier reported as HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
The statement of facts laid out in the agreement could be seen as an admission by a high-level officer of Huawei, said Roland Riopelle, a New York white-collar defense lawyer not involved in Meng's case, ""but if she is not available for cross-examination, it is almost certainly not admissible.""
Meng https://www.reuters.com/business/huawei-heir-apparent-prepares-life-after-three-years-canada-court-battle-2021-09-24 flew home to China on Friday and is unlikely to return to the United States to help the government in its case against the company founded by her father, Ren Zhengfei. 
In other cases, prosecutors typically call individuals like Meng to the witness stand to testify about their agreements with the government. But if Meng does not appear in court, Huawei cannot exercise its right to confront her as provided by the 6th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. ""If she does not come back, and no one has the opportunity to cross-examine her, it is inadmissible,"" said Charles Stillman, another New York defense lawyer. 
The statement of facts identified Skycom Tech Co Ltd as a Hong Kong company that operated in Iran but was controlled by Huawei. It noted that Skycom was not a business partner, as Meng had claimed, and that Meng had falsely stated Huawei operated in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions. 
Prosecutors said the deception by Meng and colleagues was intended to obtain banking services from global financial institutions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.
The statement of facts also could be raised by the U.S. Department of Justice in talks with the company's lawyers in an effort to avoid trial, experts said, even if it would not be allowed in as evidence.Washington lawyer Juan Morillo, who often handles high-profile white collar and cross-border cases, said it ""gives them some additional leverage in negotiations with Huawei."" 
But Morillo said the company could argue Meng's agreement was also the ""product of extortion"" because she may have felt forced to sign it to gain her freedom. So ultimately, he said, the value would be minimal.

Huawei can also note that it did not sign the agreement and is not bound by it. In fact, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Saturday said ""the so-called 'fraud' charges against"" Meng were ""purely fabricated."" ""I've been in cases similar to this, and that's what the strategy is going to be with Huawei,"" said Morillo. ""They'll say, 'This is a fabrication. This is the product of extortion and it has no binding effect on us at all.'""
Huawei faces wire fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy charges that included Meng. It also faces other charges, including for violating sanctions on Iran, obstructing justice, and conspiring to steal trade secrets from U.S. technology companies. It has pleaded not guilty.

Investing.com – Disney stock (NYSE:DIS) fell 2.3% Tuesday after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) cut the price target for the stock to $203 while maintaining an overweight rating.
The new target, which is $13 lower from the previous one, is still 16% higher than the stock’s current price.
Analyst Steven Cahall, while maintaining his confidence in the company, said the price target needed to be lowered as the brokerage resets its subscriber numbers for the streaming giant in view of recent comments made by  Disney  CEO Bob Chapek.
While retaining his “bullish and confident outlook” about long-term subscriber growth, Chapek told an investor conference recently that he expected an increase only in the “low single-digit millions of subscribers” for its at-home streaming service Disney+ in the ongoing quarter.
According to reports, the Wells Fargo analyst cut his 2024 Disney+ subscriber estimate to 236 million from 256 million against company’s guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers. He estimates total Disney streaming users to touch 335 million compared to a guidance of 300 million to 350 million.
The company had closed the third quarter ended July 3 with a paid subscriber base of 173.7 million across its Disney+, EPSN+ and Hulu platforms.
“Now at the lower end of the Disney+ long-term guidance, we expect investors to wonder if it’s a risky bar,” Cahall concluded."

Investing.com –  Thor Industries  stock (NYSE:THO) soared nearly 9% Tuesday as the maker of recreational vehicles recorded its most profitable year with annual sales topping the $12 billion mark for the first time.
The robust performance comes on the back of production falling short as the economy reopened. People stepped out to enjoy the great outdoors again, and demand for its recreational vehicles soared.
According to Thor Industries President and CEO Bob Martin, the sustained demand has led to historically low dealer inventory levels getting extended and resulted in a new record-high backlog value of $16.86 billion as of July 31, almost triple from last year’s.
The company sold over 300,000 units during the year and posted a diluted earnings per share of $11.85, nearly triple of previous year’s $4.02 and erasing the previous record of $8.14 set in financial year 2018.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell at the opening on Tuesday as fears of inflation continued to push up bond yields, pressuring valuations that have been supported since the start of the pandemic by extraordinary stimulus measures.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4%, near its lowest level in a month, while the S&P 500 was down 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 100 points, a relatively modest 0.3%. 
As on Monday, the Dow's outperformance was due largely to strength in banking, energy and other 'value' stocks, whose stronger near-term cash flow leaves them better able to cope with rising interest rates.  The 10-Year Treasury yield rose to a new three-month high of 1.56% before retreating a little to 1.54%.
The market was unsettled by the pre-release of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress, due at 10:00 AM ET, which acknowledged that inflation inflation had been stronger than expected and is likely to remain ""elevated"" for at least some months.
While inflation during the economic rebound this year has been tied to certain sectors, rather than a broadly based rise in prices, it has grown increasingly acute in the last few months, with further evidence of the phenomenon Tuesday in national house prices, which rose 19.2% on the year through August. 
There were conspicuous drops in some of the heavyweight tech names that have been responsible for much of the broader market gains this year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)t stock and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock both fell 2.0%, while  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock fell 2.6% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 2.7%, as investors booked profits to focus on stocks with less challenging valuations. 
Vaccine makers were among the biggest fallers in early trading, amid optimism that the worst of the pandemic is now at least behind the U.S., if not the rest of the world. New infections have fallen by over half since their peak earlier this month, with deaths also seemingly past their peak.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 5.8% while  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell 7.1%, Studies showing that Moderna's vaccine may protect people against Covid-19 for longer than rival  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s have worked against the stock in the last couple of days, suggesting that there may be less need for health authorities to buy booster shots from the company.
Energy stocks were broadly supported by the continued rise in natural gas prices, even though crude oil prices fell back after the global benchmark Brent touched a three-year high of over $80 a barrel overnight.

PARIS (Reuters) -Sanofi is dropping plans for its own mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine because of the dominance achieved by BioNTech-Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) in using the technology to fight the pandemic, the company said on Tuesday.
The move highlights the challenges of competing in particular with pioneer BioNTech, which rose from obscurity through its alliance with pharma major  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) last year. They have delivered close to 1.5 billion doses so far to become the Western world's largest COVID-19 vaccine maker.
French healthcare group  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) will instead focus on efforts with British partner GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) to bring another COVID-19 vaccine candidate to market based on the more conventional protein-based approach, where mass trials are ongoing.
The decision to drop clinical development of a shot based on mRNA, or messenger RNA, acquired as part of its takeover of Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO), came despite positive Phase I/II study interim results https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-09-28-08-00-00-2304069 announced on Tuesday, where participants' blood readings showed a strong immune reaction.
But Sanofi said the read-out encouraged it only to pursue the technology as a potential vaccine against influenza and other diseases, giving up on the area of COVID-19 because of the strong market presence of the two approved mRNA shots.
""The results are extremely important as they show us that the platform we acquired works,"" Thomas Triomphe, head of the Sanofi Pasteur vaccines division, told journalists. He said kicking off final Phase III trials now made no sense. 
""Would it, responsibly, be the best use of this wealth of science afforded by mRNA vaccines to make a COVID-19 vaccine and try and bring another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to people who already today may not want an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine? Clearly not,"" Triomphe said. 
He also dismissed the prospect for annual repeat shots, which has been intensely debated by researchers and pharmaceutical executives, with clear trial results on the need for yearly boosters still to come.
U.S. regulators cleared a third Pfizer-BioNTech shot half a year after the initial two-shot course for some at-risk groups and Moderna aims to follow suit.
Triomphe said that given evidence of virus-fighting antibodies surging after a third shot, a recurring market was out of the question. ""With a fourth dose you'd have extremely high antibodies and you absolutely would not need an annual COVID-19 vaccine."" he added.
He said that by May or June 2022, some 24 billion doses of COVID-19 jabs made by different manufacturers would already have been delivered.
Sanofi's shares were 0.1% higher 82.2 euros by 1136 GMT, outperforming a 1.21% decline in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care.
""The decision to end RNA looks to be interpreted as positive since they will save development costs and concentrate on other products and ventures,"" said Ion-Marc Valahu, a fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Clairinvest. 
But Sanofi's comparatively slow progress in developing a COVID-19 vaccine - its project with GSK was delayed late last year - has been a blow to its prestige and lamented by some French politicians. 
The company said it started testing an mRNA shot against seasonal influenza in humans in June and would launch follow-on clinical studies next year.
FLU COMPETITION
The development of RNA flu shots is already shaping up to be a tight race as drugmakers hope they can more quickly adjust the vaccine to ever-changing strains in circulation. Unlike the highly mutant flu virus, the coronavirus reduces genetic copying errors when replicating in a host organism.
Pfizer said this week it had started testing an mRNA flu vaccine. Moderna has several influenza vaccine candidates in development, including combinations that include a COVID-19 booster.
Established influenza vaccine supplier Seqirus, part of Australia's CSL (OTC:CSLLY), for instance, is working on next-generation low-dose RNA flu shots, known as self-amplifying RNA. 
Companies including  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) are also working on novel flu shots using new technology beyond mRNA.
Sanofi reported 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in sales from flu vaccines in 2020, the largest of its vaccine business, which recorded total sales of 5.9 billion euros.
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines trick the human body into producing proteins known as antigens that are found on the surface of the coronavirus that causes the disease. That primes the immune system to quell future infections.
Under the more traditional protein-based vaccine approach that Sanofi will now focus on, the antigen is bioengineered in labs and combined with an efficacy-boosting ingredient known as an adjuvant, provided by GSK.
Triomphe said the European Union and Britain had ordered 75 million doses of this vaccine, banking on future regulatory approval.
German biotech firm CureVac earlier this month also acknowledged rivals' dominance when it cancelled some of the contract manufacturing deals for its experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with two prospective partners.

CureVac's product is under review by the EU's drugs regulator, with an uncertain outcome after disappointing trial results.

Investing.com –  Huntsman  stock (NYSE:HUN) rose 5.3% in Tuesday’s premarket trading on a report in The Wall Street Journal that activist hedge fund Starboard holds a more than 8% stake in the chemicals producer.
The company makes several chemicals that find use in plastics, cars and construction materials.
The stock's bounce was also benefiting from investors rotating their money out of growth stocks and ploughing that into value shares.  
At Huntsman’s market cap of $6.23 billion as of close Monday, Starboard’s the stake is worth around $500 million.
The company’s stock has slightly under-performed the broader market in the last year, rising about 31% against S&P 500’s near-35% gain.
The hedge fund is one of the most visible activist investors on Wall Street, holding seats on the boards of companies like Papa John’s and NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK). The changes Starboard is likely to push for at Huntsman are not clear yet, the report said.

The German carmaker admitted wrongdoing in the Dieselgate scandal in 2015, triggering a series of legal cases, some of which have come before the European Court of Justice.
""There have been court rulings exposing Volkswagen's unfair treatment of consumers, and yet the car maker is not willing to work with consumer organisations to find appropriate solutions for consumers,"" EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders said in a statement.
""As I wrote to the company last year, not only consumers residing in Germany, but all consumers need to be compensated.""

The Commission said that Volkswagen had informed it of its view that voluntary payments to European consumers residing outside Germany were not justified since the affected cars have now been altered to meet legal requirements.
""The company's position has not changed despite recent EU and national court decisions which is why the Commission and EU consumer authorities are mounting the pressure,"" the Commission said in a statement.

Investing.com – ADRs of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) tumbled 5.4% on Nasdaq in Tuesday’s premarket trading, leading the broader European technology sector lower amid a broad rotation out of growth stocks and into value.
Chipmakers STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) were also down by over 4% as some of the year's most profitable trades to date were closed out. Payments company  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), another tech darling of European markets, fell 5.0%.
New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu earlier downgraded ASML to ‘neutral’ with a 660-euro target, 2.5% lower than its current level of 670 euros in Amsterdam trading.
Ferragu kept his five-year outlook on the stock but said record valuations limited upside possibility, while the company has already exhausted most of the scope to expand margins amid the worldwide scramble for chipmaking equipment. 
At the time of providing its second-quarter update in July, ASML said it expects third-quarter net sales of around 5.3 billion euros, with a gross margin of just over 50%.
New Street's Ferragu said he sees demand for Memory chips and NAND chips slowing down in 2022. 
The Dutch company makes machines used by world’s top companies to produce chips that go into mobiles, laptops, TVs and cars. It also provides software and services that help those companies mass produce patterns on silicon. For some of the most advanced semiconductors that go into laptops, mobiles and other digital devices, ASML is the only maker of equipment used to make them.  
For companies like ASML and its clients, the pandemic brought the opportunity of a lifetime as homes doubled up as offices and demand for digital devices boomed. As waiting lines for products like mobiles and laptops lengthened, chipmakers have begun to build new capacity. While that investment cycle is likely to last years, easy monetary policy meant that investors discounted almost all of it ahead of time in the last 18 months.

Barilla, whose Gocciole biscuits are the best sellers in Italy, said the partnership would increase demand for its cookie and snack brands especially in the summer season.
It will also help the group be more competitive in selling both sweet and salted snacks in the out-of-home channels where it competes with large foreign groups and chocolate confectioner Ferrero.
""We are convinced that the ice cream market offers interesting prospects and we know that we have brands and products that are of great interest to the Italian consumer,"" Barilla's Head of Italy Region Francesco Del Porto said.
""Our ambition is also to be increasingly present in the out-of-home sector, thanks to the Unilever Group, which has very long experience and an extensive distribution network.""
Ice creams developed together with Cornetto-seller Algida will build on the successful launch of Barilla's cookies filled with chocolate spread and the sale of cereal bars, which have built the Parma-based group's presence in the snack segment.
The partnership will be operational from January 2022 and will initially cover Italy, with the aim of expanding to other European countries, the two groups said.

For Unilever the agreement is an opportunity to offer new products in a sector that is increasingly competitive.

(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts gave upbeat estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s quarterly vehicle deliveries on Tuesday, with one research group predicting it to be the best quarter for the company even as the auto sector wrestles with an unprecedented shortage of parts.
The electric-car maker had flagged an unusually high end-of-quarter wave of deliveries in a staff memo earlier this month, when Chief Executive Elon Musk asked employees to ""go super hardcore"" to make up for production challenges early in the third quarter.
Analysts at Piper Sandler and RBC raised their estimates to about 233,000 vehicle deliveries for the third quarter ending Sept. 30, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s estimate was 225,000-230,000.
The figures represent a 65%-67% jump from a year earlier. As of Monday, analysts on average expected 222,700 Tesla vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, according to market data provider Visible Alpha data.
Analysts have also said the impact of the global semiconductor shortage, which has crippled many automakers around the world, may have been smaller on Tesla.
""Tesla appears to have been less impacted by the shortage than other (automakers),"" Credit Suisse's Dan Levy said in a report, citing its ""quick pivot"" to new microcontrollers and writing its own vehicle software.
The third quarter will likely be Tesla's ""strongest"" ever, Piper Sandler's Alexander Potter said, noting increasing adoption of electric vehicles in Europe and China and Tesla's rising market share. Potter has a five-star rating for estimates and recommendations on Tesla, according to Refinitiv Eikon.

Potter also raised his forecast for annual deliveries to 894,000 from 846,000. That would nearly double last year's deliveries of 499,550.
China's role as a source of global exports for Tesla is growing, with its Shanghai plant having likely exported about 55,000 vehicles in July-August, up from roughly 30,000 in the second quarter, Credit Suisse's Levy said.

The brokerage firm raised its ratings on Land Securities and British Land to ""neutral"" from ""sell"" while arguing that the ongoing shift to hybrid work models could take a while.
""In London, the drive to return to the office is taking much longer than expected, as are corporate decisions on long-term space requirements,"" Citigroup analyst Aaron Guy said.
But, remote work could still push desk occupancy in many offices below 50% over the medium term, causing a fall in demand and rents, Guy cautioned.
Commercial landlords have already suffered steep declines in rental income and footfall at retail spaces due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As businesses adjust to flexible models of working, they may not give up existing spaces until new office designs become certain, flexible technology is tested and new space is found or existing space is refurbished, Guy said. ""This process could take years.""
There still remain risks that could push demand for office spaces lower by about 40% and office rents by 30%, Guy said while noting that any such possibility would be delayed.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. SEC cracks down a second time on SPAC equity accounting treatment - sources,"By Anirban Sen, Chris Prentice and Krystal Hu
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expanding its crackdown on the SPAC sector, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has told top auditors of blank-check acquisition companies to account more strictly for public shares in these shells, according to multiple industry accountants and lawyers familiar with the change.
SEC staff have privately told top auditors of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, or SPACs, that ""redeemable"" shares issued by these shells must be treated as temporary - known as ""mezzanine"" - equity, in a break from the long-standing industry practice of treating them as permanent equity, the people said.
The change will cause most SPACs to fall below the minimum equity capital requirement of Nasdaq's Capital Market tier, pushing SPACs looking to list on Nasdaq to its Global Market tier, which has no equity requirement, the people said.
The development marks the second time this year that the SEC has tightened SPAC accounting guidance and the latest salvo in the agency's broader crackdown on the SPAC deals market, a booming business for Wall Street over the past 18 months.
While the long-term implications of the change in listing status for SPACs in the pipeline were unclear, some industry attorneys and auditors said it was another worrying sign that the SEC was looking for ways to upend longstanding practices in the SPAC market. 
""It's a change in accounting treatment and a change in the way the SEC views the issue,"" said Jeffrey Weiner, chief executive of Marcum LLP, which handles over 40% of SPAC audit work, according to data from SPACInsider. 
SPACs are listed shell companies used to take private companies public, sidestepping the more traditional and lengthy initial public offering process. In an era of free-flowing money, more than $100 billion in SPAC deals have been inked so far this year. 
With less initial regulatory vetting than IPOs, the SEC has said the boom in SPAC deals puts investors at risk. It has increased scrutiny of the sector, from SPAC marketing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-spac/sec-warns-against-investing-in-spacs-based-solely-on-celebrity-backing-idUSKBN2B22M5 and fees to disclosures, conflicts of interest and accounting treatment.
In April, the SEC issued guidance https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/us-securities-regulator-issues-accounting-guidance-spacs-2021-04-13 suggesting hundreds of SPACs should account for equity warrants as debt, putting a damper on the market and driving efforts https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-street-grapples-with-new-spac-equity-contracts-after-regulator-crackdown-2021-06-08 to test new contracts.
In recent months, SEC staff have also questioned whether redeemable shares in the listed SPAC shell should be treated as permanent equity, since shareholders have the right to sell those back to the SPAC if they do not like the deal it proposes. 
In recent weeks, the SEC has told the auditors in private discussions that they should treat those redeemable shares entirely as ""temporary equity,"" the sources said.
The SEC's new stance is in line with its official guidance on how to treat redeemable shares and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
However, because of the unique terms of some SPAC charters, which require they hold a minimum permanent equity balance of $5 million, SPAC auditors had long treated redeemable shares as permanent equity in order to meet that threshold, without objection from the SEC, the people said. 
""The current accounting treatment had been in place and accepted for years,"" said Marcum's Weiner. He said some Marcum partners have spoken with SEC staff about the issue.
Other major SPAC auditors include Withum and KPMG. Spokespeople for the two companies declined to comment.
The sources said it was unclear if the SEC would issue public guidance on the issue. The regulator declined to comment. 
LISTINGS CHANGE 
A Nasdaq spokesperson confirmed that the accounting change had forced SPACs to switch their planned listings from its Capital Market to its Global Market.
While the SEC's new stance is unlikely to be as disruptive for the SPAC industry as its April guidance, it is creating a headache for Nasdaq. SPACs have traditionally listed on its Capital Market, which is generally for companies focused on capital raising and which has minimum capital requirements.
While its Global Market has no minimum capital requirement, it does require SPACs to have 400 shareholders, 100 more than the Capital Market, which could be problematic for some SPACs.

Nasdaq is working on a rule change that would allow companies to list on the Global Market with 300 shareholders, the spokesperson said. It was unclear when that would come into effect.
Currently, nine SPACs trade on the Global Market, according to Nasdaq data, all of which listed since June 2021, when the SEC began to question the treatment of redeemable shares.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google on Tuesday said deals with Android phone makers that landed it a record 4.3-billion-euro ($5 billion) antitrust fine boosted competition and rejected EU charges they were a carrot-and-stick tactic that stifled rivals.
Google was addressing the second day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get Europe's second-highest court to annul the fine and a European Commission order to make it loosen its search engine grip on Android devices.
Lawyers for Google and the EU competition executive clashed over the company's Mobile Application Distribution Agreements (MADAs) that require phone makers (OEMs) to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome browser app in return for licensing Google Play for free.
""This licensing model is what attracted OEMs to the Android platform, and what enabled those OEMs to offer a consistent and high-quality user experience at the lowest possible price,"" Google's lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid told the General Court.
""People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to,"" he said.
Commission lawyer Carlos Urraca Caviedes rejected the argument, calling the deals and other restrictions Google's carrot-and-stick policy towards phone makers.
""These helped Google ensured its competitors would not achieve critical mass to challenge its dominance,"" he told the court.
He also said such deals were unnecessary in view of the market power of Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, and its significant number of users.
Urraca Caviedes said what Google did ""goes beyond what is necessary to develop and maintain the Android platform"".

A verdict may come next year. The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

(Reuters) -Cheap imports have fueled the U.S. solar industry's dramatic growth for years. Now, mounting trade and transport issues is exposing that dependence as a vulnerability, slowing shipments and putting big projects at risk, according to industry representatives.
Tighter availability of foreign panels could hurt the booming industry and set back President Joe Biden’s effort to decarbonize the nation’s power sector, a centerpiece of his plan to combat climate change. Some 90% of U.S. solar panels are made overseas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Among the issues clouding solar’s outlook is an attempt by U.S. authorities to block shipments of panels containing components potentially derived from forced labor in China's Xinjiang region.
The Biden administration imposed an import ban targeting China's Hoshine Silicon Industry Co in June and since then, hundreds of megawatts of panels have been detained at the border, according to an industry source. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection would not disclose the amount of solar products it has detained. China has denied that its solar components are produced with forced labor.
At the same time, a tiny domestic solar manufacturing industry has submitted an anonymous petition calling on the U.S. Commerce Department to impose new tariffs on some imported panels over accusations of dumping products at artificially low prices. 
The Commerce Department is expected to decide this week whether to consider the request, which would affect imports from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia.
If imposed, those tariffs would jeopardize 18 gigawatts of solar projects by 2023, or enough to power more than 3 million homes, according to the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). 
The small group of domestic solar manufacturers say they remain anonymous because disclosure of their names ""could lead to retribution against these companies and cause substantial harm."" Tim Brightbill, the group's attorney, said the trade group's claims were ""wildly overstated."" 
U.S. solar developers say, however, that suppliers in Southeast Asia have already cut sales to the United States over fears their panels could get hit with retroactive levies if the Commerce Department proceeds.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
Maritime shipments of solar modules into the United States were already down 11% in August compared to 2020, and down 2% for about the first three weeks of September, according to data from financial information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
""We are getting hit right now pretty hard,"" Markus Wilhelm, chief executive of solar project developer Strata Solar, said during a press call organized by SEIA on Monday. ""We are completely dependent on a global supply chain, so we are a little bit more vulnerable.""
""We can't get module manufacturers today to sign purchase orders that we need to deliver projects in the near term,"" George Hershman, president of solar contractor Swinerton Renewable Energy, said on the call.
The issues compound a global supply squeeze stemming from the coronavirus pandemic that has already hit other industries with rising costs and delays, impacting everything from bicycle sales to the availability of smartphones. 
The U.S. solar industry earlier this month said that its installations were running at a record pace despite the shipping bottlenecks and jump in costs, but that the new threats raised the risk of a future slowdown.
Top renewable energy developer Nextera Energy Inc has led the push against the new duties in extensive filings with the Commerce Department, with support from EDF (PA:EDF) Renewables Inc, Clearway, Invenergy and  Enel  (MI:ENEI) Green Power. 
In addition to the immediate threat of new duties, the U.S. International Trade Commission will decide by the end of this year whether to extend tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in 2018 on all foreign-made panels. 
Five domestic producers requested the extension, including the U.S. arms of Korea's Hanwha Q CELLS and LG Electronics. 
One of the world's largest panel makers, JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), has been caught in the crosshairs of both the border seizures and the potential for new tariffs. 
The company said earlier this month that some of its solar panels had been stopped at the border by U.S. Customs. The company is also among the Chinese companies targeted by domestic petitioners seeking new tariffs.

Roth Capital Partners analyst Philip Shen cut his price target on JinkoSolar's stock to $51 from $58 on Sept. 16, citing the ""one-two punch.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite particularly hard hit by climbing Treasury yields.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 140 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 35 points, or 0.8%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 220 points, or 1.5%.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has soared above 1.54%, climbing to its highest level since June, in the wake of last week’s Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting. This rise has increased the pressure on stock valuations, especially for those with poor short-term cash flow.
Fed chair Jerome Powell is set to warn later Tuesday, in a speech to the Senate Banking Committee, that the recent rise in inflation may last longer than anticipated.
“Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating,” Powell said, in his pre-released speech. “As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly due to supply bottlenecks in some sectors.”
Also weighing on the market is the potential for a government shutdown as early as Friday if a funding plan isn’t agreed upon.
Economic data comes in the form of CB Consumer Confidence, which is expected to have risen to 114.5 in September from August’s 113.8, and the S&P/Case-Shiller House Price Index, which is seen having moved up in July to 20% from 19.1% in the month prior.
In corporate news, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a maker of chips and data storage technology, is expected to report fourth-quarter results Tuesday, but investors may pay more attention to its guidance given the global chip shortage.
Crude prices traded higher Tuesday, rising for the sixth consecutive session on concerns of a global supply crunch just as demand picks up with the easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
Global supplies remain tight after Hurricane Ida disrupted production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region in late August while members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies only gradually increase output.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, as well as OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $76.12 a barrel, hitting its highest since July, after jumping 2% the previous day. The Brent contract rose 0.7% to $79.30, reaching its highest since October 2018, after climbing 1.8% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,732.20/oz, while EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.1681.

Renaissance Insurance on Sept. 27 became the latest firm to announce its intention to float.
Several others are now expected to follow in a flurry of activity set in motion by the initial public offering (IPO) of state shipping company Sovcomflot last October.
Real estate database CIAN, car sharing company Delimobil, IT firm Softline, food retailer Vkusvill and the Saint Petersburg Exchange are all preparing IPOs among others, sources have said.
But Russia is not immune to market fluctuations. Gold miners GV Gold and Nordgold postponed IPOs this year, citing uncertainty and volatility in the sector. 
Below is an overview of major market debuts by Russian companies: 
2021
* In the first half of 2021, three companies staged market debuts. Cut-price retailer Fix Price's dual listing in London and Moscow raised almost $2 billion in March, making it the biggest Russian IPO since Western sanctions were introduced in 2014. 
* Forestry group Segezha (Moscow Exchange; equivalent of $402 million), and healthcare provider EMC (NYSE:EMC) (Moscow Exchange; $500 million) followed suit in April and July.
* Kismet Acquisition One Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), completed a deal with video game developer Nexters to start trading Nexters Inc. shares on the Nasdaq in August. It was the first deal involving a company from Russia and a Russian SPAC to list shares in the United States.
2019-2020
* The two major listings in 2020 were online retailer Ozon (Nasdaq; $990 million) in November and Sovcomflot (Moscow Exchange; $550 million) in October. Sovcomflot's IPO marked the first major stock exchange flotation in Moscow in three years.
* Other IPOs in 2019-2020 were Samolet (Moscow Exchange; $38.2 million), Headhunter (Nasdaq; $220 million), Kismet Acquisition One Corp (Nasdaq; $250 million), Don Agro (Singapore; $3.6 million) and Gemabank (Moscow Exchange; $2.4 million).
* Headhunter's 2019 debut was the first IPO of a Russian company in the United States since Washington began imposing sanctions on Moscow in 2014.
2018 AND EARLIER
* In 2018, there were no Russian IPOs for the first time in a decade. 
* Sixteen Russian companies carried out IPOs from 2015-2017, compared with 43 deals between 2008 and 2014.

* The biggest Russian IPO to date was a $10.7 billion flotation by oil major Rosneft in London and Moscow in 2006, followed by an $8 billion offering from state-run VTB Bank in 2007.

LONDON (Reuters) -British drivers expressed frustration on Tuesday as they hunted for hours or sat snarled in queues to fill their tanks after gas stations in major cities ran dry due to a trucker shortage that has prompted the government to put the army on standby.
Queues of drivers snaked back from those petrol stations that were still serving in major cities, though dozens of forecourts were closed with signs saying they had no petrol or diesel, Reuters reporters said.
A post-Brexit shortage of lorry drivers, exacerbated by a halt to truck-driving-licence testing during COVID lockdowns, has sown chaos through supply chains, raising the spectre of shortages and price rises in the run up to Christmas.
Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said a limited number of military tanker drivers had been put on a state of readiness to be deployed to deliver fuel if necessary.
""I can't believe it - it's crazy,"" said David Scade, a 33-year-old delivery driver who drove for hours searching for fuel in London. 
""They keep saying there is no shortage but I suppose everyone is panicking now,"" said Scade who was filling up at a Shell (LON:RDSa) gas station in London.
Fights broke out at some English petrol stations as drivers jostled for fuel. Medics said health workers should be given priority to fill their cars to keep the health service working.
An air of chaos has gripped the world's fifth largest economy in recent weeks as the shortage of truckers strained supply chains and a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices tipped energy companies into bankruptcy.
Retailers, truckers and logistics companies have warned that prices for everything from energy to Christmas gifts will have to rise. 
CHRISTMAS SUPPLY? 
British ministers, fuel companies and petrol stations say there are sufficient supplies of fuel but that the lack of truckers combined with panic buying has drained the system.
Such is the gravity of the situation that the British Medical Association has called for health workers to get priority access to fuel to ensure the health service can operate.
The demand for fuel has meant that 50% to 90% of pumps were dry in some areas of Britain, according the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent fuel retailers who account for 65% of all the 8,380 UK forecourts.
The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers. But some Polish hauliers said that offer was laughable and that few would be likely to take it up. 
Hauliers, petrol stations and retailers say there are no quick fixes as the shortfall of truck drivers - estimated at about 100,000 - was so acute, and because transporting fuel demands additional training and licensing.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) urged the government to broaden the size and scope of the scheme to attract the truckers needed to keep Christmas supplies on track.

""To avoid disappointment for millions of households during the festive season we urge the government to rapidly extend this programme, both in size and scope, to HGV drivers in all sectors of the retail industry,"" Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said.
""It will take many months before there are enough new British drivers to cover the shortfall,"" Opie said.

After the COVID-19 pandemic weighed on the economy, Saudi Arabia has returned to ambitious investment projects linked to its strategy of weaning the economy off oil, S&P said. Significant investments are being made by the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, and other entities in both the oil and non-oil sectors.
The rating agency sees Saudi Arabia's deficit dropping from 11.2% last year to 4.3% in 2021, while averaging 5.7% between this year and 2024. Real GDP growth is expected to average 2.4% in the same period after contracting 4.1% in 2020.
""In 2021, higher oil prices are being partially counterbalanced by constrained annual Saudi oil production volumes, which continue to be limited by an OPEC deal,"" S&P said in a mid-year review. 
""However, a monthly easing of quotas through 2021 and 2022 will support the Saudi oil sector and economy.""
Megaprojects such as the planned futuristic city Neom ""will be driven forward"", although ""funding pressures may impede their pace and some investors have raised questions over some of the projects' potential profitability,"" S&P said.
Gross debt is expected to continue to increase until 2024 as deficits are partly funded by public debt issuance, though Saudi Arabia will stay in a net asset position on its fiscal and external balances, S&P said. Reserves between 2021 and 2024 are expected to cover an average of 15 months of current account payments.
A significant strengthening of net asset position or improvement in growth prospects could lead S&P to raise ratings, it said.
""We could lower our ratings if we observed fiscal weakening and an erosion of the government's net asset position beyond our expectations, or a sharp deterioration in the sovereign's external position,"" the agency said.

""A sustained rise in domestic or geopolitical instability that posed a significant and continued threat to the oil sector could also weigh on the ratings.""
Geopolitical risks, especially concerning Iran and Yemen, remain, but recent overtures could help improve tensions, S&P said.

Investing.com – Ford Motor stock (NYSE:F) traded 3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket on the company’s ambitious multi-billion dollar plans to be a serious player in the electric vehicle market.  
The company will set up four factories -- three to manufacture batteries and one to make F-series pickups. Ford will invest $7 billion in the projects while South Korea’s  SK Innovation  (KS:096770) has committed $4.4 billion.
Ford will set up the battery factories with SK under a joint venture. Two battery factories in Kentucky and a third in western Tennessee alongside a new truck factory will come online by 2025, according to a joint press release.
The truck factory is Ford’s first completely new U.S. assembly plant in decades and its $7-billion investment is the largest ever in manufacturing at one time by any automotive manufacturer in the U.S. It forms part of a plan to invest more than $30 billion in electric vehicles through 2025, the press release said.
The company expects 40% to 50% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030.
Ford’s thrust on EV comes amid a worsening climate change. More and more investors and consumers are now turning away from products considered harmful for the environment and asking companies to provide a roadmap for a greener and a sustainable portfolio of products. It’s this movement that has made Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) market cap bigger than all legacy automakers’ market cap combined.

DENVER (Reuters) - Tallgrass Energy Partners will begin monitoring emissions, including methane and other greenhouse gases, on its Rockies Express Pipeline, making it the first U.S. company to measure and certify the environmental impact of operations on an interstate natural gas pipeline.
Natural gas producers, transporters and utilities are embracing carbon-reduction measures and third-party ratings to show investors and customers they are serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions amid concerns over their environmental impact. 
Tallgrass and carbon-measurement firm Project Canary this year plan to begin installing monitoring devices at compressor stations along the 1,700-mile pipeline to rate the environmental impact of its operations. The devices will help provide real time measurements of fugitive methane emissions, among other things.
""Buyers want assurances that natural gas is produced and transported in the most environmentally responsible way possible,"" said Matt Sheehy, president of Tallgrass.
Natural gas certification has been picking up steam in the past year among producers and utilities. Project Canary counts EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) and LNG-project developer NextDecade (NASDAQ:NEXT) among its customers. MiQ, another firm that applies measurements to help manage carbon emissions, has signed  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) to use its methodologies. 
""This has been a missing link,"" said Project Canary CEO Chris Romer, of pipeline operators' role in emissions reduction. It is holding talks with more than a dozen other pipelines looking to monitor and certify the emissions footprint of their operations, he said. 

The Rockies Express Pipeline transports up to 4.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas between northwestern Colorado and eastern Ohio. Tallgrass owns a 75% stake in the line, with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) holding the remaining share. 
The Colorado School of Mines will partner with Project Canary for the certification process.

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe needs to stop being naive when it comes to defending its interests and build its own military capacity, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday after Greece sealed a deal for French frigates worth about 3 billion euros ($3.51 billion).
France was plunged into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with the United States, Australia and Britain earlier this month over a trilateral nuclear security deal which sank a multi-billion dollar French-designed submarine contract with Canberra. 
That has caused much soul searching in Paris over its traditional alliances. Speaking for the first time on the issue, Macron on Tuesday seized the opportunity to urge for more European autonomy as Washington increasingly reorientates its interests towards China and the Indo-Pacific. 
""The Europeans must stop being naive. When we are under pressure from powers, which at times harden (their stance) , we need to react and show that we have the power and capacity to defend ourselves. Not escalating things, but protecting ourselves,"" Macron told a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
""This isn't an alternative to the United States alliance. It's not a substitution, but to take responsibility of the European pillar within NATO and draw the conclusions that we are asked to take care of our own protection.""
Under Tuesday's agreement Athens agreed to buy three frigates with an option to buy a fourth for about 3 billion euros, a Greek government source told Reuters.
The accord, part of a broader strategic military and defence cooperation pact, comes after Athens had already ordered some 24 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets this year, making it the first European Union country to buy the fighter jet.
""This will tie us for decades,"" Mitsotakis said. ""This opens the door to the Europe of tomorrow that is strong and autonomous, capable of defending its interests."" 
When asked whether this deal risked raising tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, Macron said the accord did not target a country specifically, but Greece, as the outer border of the European Union needed to be protected. 
""I don't get the feeling that in the summer of 2020 it was Greece that was bellicose in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Macron said, alluding to Turkish actions in the region. 

""As Europeans it is our duty to show solidarity with members states. It is legitimate that we commit to equipping it so it can ensure its territorial integrity is respected and that we commit to cooperating to protect it in case of intrusions, attacks or aggressions,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two American siblings prevented from leaving China since 2018 returned to the United States over the weekend, according to a U.S. official, their release by Beijing coming shortly after the United States ended a legal case against a top Huawei executive. 
Cynthia and Victor Liu returned to America after more than three years during which they were not allowed to leave China under an ""exit ban"" despite not facing criminal allegations. Their father, former bank official and fugitive Liu Changming, is wanted in China to face fraud charges. 
The exit of the two Americans followed an agreement that allowed Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to return to China from Canada after U.S. prosecutors dropped a fraud case against her.
Within hours of the news of the deal, two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody were released from Chinese detention and sent back to Canada.
Beijing had denied that those arrests were linked.
The White House on Monday said the Canadians' release was not a prisoner swap, but that their cases came up in a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a Sept. 9 call.
The Justice Department has said its decision on Meng's case was decided independently.
""We welcome Cynthia and Victor Liu's return to the United States on Sunday,"" said a State Department spokesperson, adding that U.S. consular staff in Shanghai helped facilitate the siblings' exit.
""We will continue to advocate on behalf of all American citizens in the PRC subject to arbitrary detention and coercive exit bans.""

The White House declined to comment on the Americans who exited China.

Moonpig, which listed on the stock market in February, accounts for nearly two-thirds of the online greetings card market in Britain and the Netherlands. 
The company said it expected group revenue for the year ending in April 2022 to be between about 270 million pounds and 285 million pounds ($369 million-389 million), up from its previous estimate of 250 million to 260 million pounds.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Japanese drugmaker Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) on Monday began its application process for its experimental drug for early Alzheimer's disease using an accelerated approval pathway, the same path that helped Eisai's development partner Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) win U.S. approval of its medication in June.
The Biogen/Eisai drug Aduhelm was the first Alzheimer's treatment to win approval in nearly 20 years, but the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) controversial use of the accelerated approval process - which authorizes drugs for severe conditions without strong proof of a benefit to patients - has come under heavy fire.
Biogen and Eisai won authorization for Aduhelm based on evidence that it can reduce brain plaques, a likely contributor to Alzheimer's, rather than convincing proof that it slows progression of the lethal disease. Companies are required to run confirmatory studies to prove the drug works as intended.
Now, Eisai, which leads development on Alzheimer's drug lecanemab, is using evidence from a midstage trial showing its drug candidate removes brain plaques to an even greater degree than Aduhelm, with lower rates of brain swelling. 
Eisai intends to learn from its partner's experiences as it works through the regulatory process. Ivan Cheung, president of Eisai's global neurology group, said in an interview the company is being as transparent as possible. 
Eisai will submit its application to the FDA on a rolling basis, with the aim of completing the application in the next few months. The company plans to submit data from its midstage trial of 856 volunteers, which showed that 80% of patients had no amyloid left in their brains after 18 months of treatment. 
That benefit also correlated with improvements seen in some patients, Cheung said. The trial was published in Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, a peer-reviewed journal, in April.
A key point of contention with the Aduhelm approval is the timing of the confirmatory trial, which FDA officials said could take several years. Eisai already has a confirmatory, Phase III trial fully enrolled. Cheung expects results before the end of 2022.
""We understand the urgency for the public to have validating clinical data,"" Cheung said. 

The FDA initially gave Aduhelm a broad indication that went beyond what was studied in its trials. Cheung said his company only wants the FDA to consider the drug's exact study population - early Alzheimer's.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co said in July it also plans to seek accelerated approval for its Alzheimer's candidate, donanemab, based on mid-stage data. Lilly has said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval by yearend.

STOCKHOLM/OSLO (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed robotics firm AutoStore said on Tuesday it seeks to raise $315 million by listing on the Oslo Bourse for an initial public offering (IPO) at a valuation that could make it Norway's largest stock launch in two decades.
In April, SoftBank bought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-autostore-idUSKBN2BS1YC a 40% stake in the Norwegian company for $2.8 billion, valuing AutoStore at about $7 billion. Thomas H. Lee Partners and EQT (NYSE:EQT) are among its other investors.
AutoStore did not disclose its expected valuation, but based on its last funding round the company could top Adevinta's $6.20 billion IPO in 2019 and also become the largest since the 2001 listing of  Statoil  (OL:EQNR), now known as Equinor.
The IPO could give the company a valuation of around $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Founded in 1996, AutoStore has 20,000 robots deployed across 30 countries to automate warehouse operations. The company also uses robots to densely store and retrieve products allowing customers to store four times the inventory in the same space.
The company, whose customers include ASDA, Gucci and Lufthansa, plans to use to proceeds to reduce debt, invest in growth and allow share sale by its investors.

AutoStore expects total revenue of about $300 million in 2021 and more than $500 million in 2022 with a project pipeline worth $3.4 billion across 2,000 projects. It reported a net revenue of $182.1 million last year.
The IPO is expected to be priced during October.

Investing.com - European stock markets retreated Tuesday, with high-growth tech stocks pressured by rising bond yields, while investors digest the inconclusive German election and Chinese property group Evergrande’s ongoing debt crisis.
At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%.
Soaring U.S. Treasury yields following last week’s Federal Reserve meeting have translated into higher yields in Europe, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year German bund climbing 3 basis points Tuesday. 
The tech sector has suffered as a consequence, with Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) stock falling 7.7%, not helped by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgrading the Swiss company to ‘underweight’ from ‘equal weight’, and ASM International (OTC:ASMIY) stock falling 3.6% despite the Dutch semiconductor supplier raising its third-quarter order intake guidance.
On the flip side, financials were supported by the rising interest rates, with the likes of SEB (ST:SEBa), Aegon (NYSE:AEG), ABN (AS:ABNd), Raiffeisen (VIE:RBIV) and Virgin Money (LON:VM) all trading at 52-week highs. Eni (MI:ENI), BP (NYSE:BP) also reached 52-week highs as oil and gas prices continued to climb. Most notable was the 13-year high hit by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), arguably the only company that can offer a reasonably quick fix to the shortage of gas in Europe.
Additionally, easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell 3.6% after the airline said it had received acceptances from investors for 93% of the new shares it sold as part of a 1.2 billion pound ($1.64 billion) fully underwritten rights issue.
Investors will be keeping an eye on the ramifications of Germany’s general election on Sunday, which resulted in the Social Democrats party narrowly winning the vote. Prolonged negotiations are likely to follow in order to form a coalition to govern Europe's biggest economy, but the far left's weak result has in all likelihood ruled it out as a potential partner, to the market’s relief.
Investors also continue to fret about the future of China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), and the potential for global contagion, after it failed on Friday to meet a deadline to make an interest payment to offshore bond holders. China's economy is also suffering from spreading power outages, with the electricity system unable to meet demand from both households and industry. 
Back in Europe, the European Central Bank will hold its annual research meeting, with ECB President Christine Lagarde’s speech sure to be watched for any sign that rising energy prices are changing the bank's thinking about inflation. European gas and power prices surged to new record highs in early trade on Tuesday.
Ahead of that, the widely-watched German GfK consumer sentiment data showed a surprise rise in confidence in October, to +0.3 from a revised -1.1 the previous month.
Crude prices traded higher Tuesday, rising for the sixth consecutive session on concerns of a global supply crunch just as demand picks up with the easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute are due later in the day, as well as OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook. By 4:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $76.22 a barrel, a two-month high. Brent rose 0.8% to $79.32, its highest since October 2018.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,740.25/oz, while EUR/USD edged 0.1% lower to 1.1679.

Prices in the global financial hub rose by a revised 0.8% in July, before dipping 0.15% in August, official data showed. The price index of 397.7 for July was a record high and compares with 397.1 in August. 
The previous record high was 396.9 in May 2019 before mass anti-government protests and the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Prices are up 4.5% since the end of last year, buoyed by a recovering economy and hopes that mainland Chinese buyers will return to the market when COVID travel restrictions are lifted.
In Hong Kong, 7.5 million people are packed into roughly 30% of the territory, with the rest comprising green belts, country parks, woodlands and wetlands where any plans for development have faced tough opposition from environmentalists. 
Making housing more affordable has been a priority for all of Hong Kong's leaders since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, although the prospect of owning a home is still a distant dream for many. 
During a visit to a property showroom in August, Eunice Ma, 50, said she was planning to buy a two-bedroom in a high-end new development close to the mainland China border for her 26-year old son. 
""Whether the flat will make a profit or not, I don’t think about it that way, because I purely want it for my son's marriage in the future,"" she said.
The city also has a serious shortage of car parks, resulting in some spaces fetching huge sums of money. Local media reported earlier this year that a luxury residential development on The Peak sold a parking space for HK$10.2 million ($79 million).
As part of efforts to solve the chronic housing shortage, Hong Kong plans to build artificial islands at an estimated cost of at least HK$624 billion. 
Betting on the high demand, real estate is still seen by many as the safest investment.

""Keeping the money in a bank doesn’t give you interest, but with an apartment you can at least rent it out,” said Vera Tang, a 50-year old housewife who was looking to use her retirement fund to buy an apartment for investment.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Tuesday, as investors continue to digest the inconclusive result of the weekend’s German election as well as Chinese property group Evergrande’s ongoing debt crisis.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
Investors will be keeping an eye on the ramifications of Germany’s general election on Sunday, which resulted in the Social Democrats party narrowly winning the vote.
Prolonged negotiations are likely to follow in order to form a coalition to govern Europe's biggest economy, but the far left's weak result has in all likelihood ruled it out as a potential partner, to the market’s relief.
Investors also continue to fret about the future of China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), and the potential for global contagion, after it failed on Friday to meet a deadline to make an interest payment to offshore bond holders. The world’s most indebted property developer now has 30 days to make the payment before it falls into default. The Chinese central bank injected another 100 billion yuan into the money market on Tuesday to keep conditions stable.
Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its forecast for China’s 2021 economic growth to 7.8% from 8.2% and for 2022 to 5.5% in a note earlier Tuesday, citing issues at energy-intensive industries as well as concerns over managing stresses in the real estate market.
Back in Europe, the European Central Bank will hold its annual research meeting, with ECB President Christine Lagarde’s speech sure to be watched for any sign that surging energy prices are changing the bank's thinking about inflation. European gas and power prices surged to new record highs in early trade on Tuesday.
Ahead of that, the widely-watched German GfK consumer sentiment data showed a surprise rise in confidence in October, to +0.3 from a revised -1.1 the previous month.
Crude prices traded higher Tuesday, rising for the sixth consecutive session on concerns of a global supply crunch just as demand picks up with the easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
Global supplies remain tight after Hurricane Ida disrupted production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region in late August while members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies only gradually increase output.
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day, as well as OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $76.38 a barrel, hitting its highest since July, after jumping 2% the previous day. The Brent contract rose 1.1% to $79.62, reaching its highest since October 2018, after climbing 1.8% on Monday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,747.90/oz, while EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1698.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's antitrust watchdog called for powers to curb Google's use of internet data to sell targeted ads, joining other regulators in saying the firm dominates the market to the point of hurting publishers, advertisers and consumers.
The comments, in a report published on Tuesday, puts Australia alongside Europe and Britain where regulators want to stop the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit trouncing rival advertisers by using the data it collects from people's online searches - including on maps and YouTube - to place marketing material.
The U.S. justice department is meanwhile preparing an anti-monopoly lawsuit accusing Google of using its market muscle to hobble advertising rivals, according to media reports. 
""The Europeans and the U.K. are consulting on such laws at the moment and we're going to be trying to align with them over the next year,"" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chair Rod Sims said in a Reuters interview.
""I don't think we're far behind.""
Already this year Google said it was poised to withdraw core services from Australia over a law - also recommended by the ACCC - forcing it to pay media companies for content that drives traffic to its search engine. It ultimately inked deals with most major outlets.
Google said, following the report, that its advertising arm supported over 15,000 Australian jobs and contributed $2.45 billion to Australia's economy annually.
""As one of the many advertising technology providers in Australia, we will continue to work collaboratively with industry and regulators to support a healthy ads ecosystem,"" a spokesperson said.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who commissioned the report, said the government would consider its findings and recommendations.
'BETTER INTERNET'
While the U.S. justice department would likely use existing competition law against Google, the ACCC said in its 200-page report that Google's dominance of Australian online advertising was so entrenched that existing laws were insufficient to rein in any anticompetitive behaviour.
More than 90% of clicks on Australian internet ads were at least partly the result of one of Google's offerings in 2020, the regulator said.
The ACCC said the U.S. company benefited from vast amounts of internet user data from its search engine, mapping and YouTube video streaming services, and must be made to clarify publicly how it used that information to sell and display advertisements.
It also wants special powers to address the imbalance of advertiser access to consumer data, such as introducing a rule that would stop a company from using data collected by one part of its business to sell targeted advertisements via another part without a rival company getting the same benefit.
Sims said he expected the global push to increase regulation of Google's advertising business would raise the chances of cooperation between the U.S. internet giant and the regulator.

""I just think they can see what's happening and it's in their interests that these rules are aligned (between countries) and it's in their interests that they're really well thought through,"" he said in the interview.
""We don't want to stifle innovation, we don't want to have any negative effects, we just want to promote competition, reduce entry barriers, so that consumers get a better internet, better transparency about what's going on, and companies aren't paying too much.""

The debt crisis engulfing China Evergrande Group has begun to dent homebuyer sentiment in China and force developers to cut prices. With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its problems could spread through China's financial system and reverberate around the world - a worry that has eased as damage has so far been concentrated in the property sector.
Arthur Yuen, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, told a conference these problems were unlikely to have a major effect on banks in the Asian financial hub. 

""Both the industry and the media has been focusing a lot of attention on highly-leveraged borrowers, in particular some of the developers in mainland China. On that one, both the industry and ourselves have been paying a lot of attention to industry sectors that are under relatively greater stress in the past few years, so our banking system’s exposure to these highly-leveraged borrowers is not that high."" 
""The risk there is pretty much manageable at the moment, but nonetheless we would urge the industry to remain vigilant,"" Yuen said.

DETROIT/SEOUL (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation will invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States, accelerating the U.S. automaker's push into electric vehicles.
Ford said on Monday it now expects to have 40% to 50% of its global vehicle volume to be all-electric by 2030, up from its prior forecast of 40%. 
The companies intend to create nearly 11,000 jobs by opening assembly and battery plants in Stanton, Tennessee, and two additional battery factories in Glendale, Kentucky, as part of Ford's previously announced plan to spend more than $30 billion through 2030 on electrification, Ford said. Plants on both sites will open in 2025. 
Monday's announcement is the single largest manufacturing investment in Ford's 118-year history.
The Tennessee assembly and battery complex will be about three times the size of Ford's sprawling, century-old Rouge manufacturing complex in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford North American Chief Operating Officer Lisa Drake told Reuters in an interview. She emphasized there will be room to expand on that site. 
""For us, this is a very transformative point where we are putting our capital in place now in a very big way to lead the transition to EVs,"" Drake said. 
The No.2 U.S. carmaker's portion of the investment is $7 billion, with SK covering the rest. The companies will invest $5.8 billion in Kentucky, and $5.6 billion in Tennessee.
The South Korean battery maker, which supplies electric car batteries to Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor Co among others, has battery production sites in the United States, Hungary, China and South Korea.
With its three additional battery factories and two battery plants in Georgia, SK Innovation is set to secure an annual capacity of about 150 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of batteries in the United States. 
SK Innovation said it expects to exceed the goal of securing an annual global production capacity of 200 GWh of batteries by 2025. Its current capacity stands at 40 GWh. 
Shares of SK Innovation rose as much as 3.6% to hit a near two-week high of 260,500 won in morning trade, versus the broader market KOSPI's 0.8% fall. Ford closed up 2.8% on Monday. 
Ford, which plans to launch the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck next spring, has moved more aggressively to roll out its EV strategy under Jim Farley, who took over as chief executive last October. Earlier this month, Ford doubled planned production capacity in Dearborn, Michigan, for the F-150 Lightning https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-ford-doubles-lightning-production-target-strong-pre-launch-demand-2021-08-23 to 80,000 annually due to strong pre-launch demand for the electric pickup.
Ford and other automakers are pushing hard to prepare for the rollout of EVs as countries and regions such as China and Europe seek greater reduction of vehicle emissions.
The planned lithium-ion battery plants build on a memorandum of understanding announced by Ford and SK in May. The battery plants will be jointly owned with SK and have a combined annual capacity of 129 GWh of batteries, which could power about 2.2 million EVs when fully operational, more than double the level outlined in May, Drake said. The new capacity would be enough to power more than 1 million EVs.
Ford previously said its global EV plan calls for at least 240 GWh of battery cell capacity by 2030, equal to about 10 plants that will be placed in North America, Europe and China. SK has said it aims to ramp up annual global battery capacity to more than 200 GWh in 2025.
TENNESSEE MEGA CAMPUS
As part of Monday's announcement, Ford will build a 3,600-acre ""mega campus"" in west Tennessee called Blue Oval City that will employ 5,800 people and include the assembly plant, lithium-ion battery production and a supplier park, Drake said. Blue Oval plays off Ford's name for its corporate logo. 
The new Tennessee assembly plant will build the next generation of the Lightning, using a dedicated EV platform, following its launch next year, Drake said. The initial Lightning model will be built on a platform heavily derived from the gasoline-powered F-150.
Drake did not disclose the planned production capacity for the Tennessee truck plant.
The site will also include zero-waste-to-landfill processes to capture materials and scrap. 
In central Kentucky, Ford will build BlueOvalSK Battery Park, employing 5,000 people. The site will consist of twin plants building lithium-ion batteries for Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles, starting in 2025. The second factory will open the following year.
The companies will receive $500 million in incentives from Tennessee and almost $300 million as well as more than 1,500 acres of land from Kentucky.
The United Auto Workers union, which represents Ford's U.S. hourly workers, has said the automaker has a ""moral obligation"" to make sure any battery plant jobs are good-paying union jobs. Drake said that will be determined by the workers, but added Ford emphasized to SK it must not be anti-union.

Monday's announcement builds on Ford's deal last week to partner with Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials to form a circular supply chain for EV batteries, from raw materials to recycling. Redwood will be located at Ford's Tennessee site. 
Ford said on Monday it will separately spend $525 million over the next five years to fund job training and career readiness initiatives for U.S. auto technicians to help prepare for the shift to EVs. That program begins in Texas, where Ford is spending $90 million alone.

GAMECO, a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) provider part-owned by China Southern Airlines Co Ltd, had already been running three 737-800BCF lines converting passenger planes through earlier deals with Boeing. 
The 767 deal will make it Boeing's biggest freighter conversion centre globally, GAMECO CEO Norbert Marx said on the sidelines of Airshow China, the country's biggest air show.
Airlines and leasing firms have been rushing to permanently convert older passenger jets into freighters since the start of the pandemic, betting on a boom in e-commerce as the value of used planes tumbles.

Marx said air cargo demand was strong, in part because of to a restructuring of the global supply chain.
The conversion boom is also helping aviation MRO groups offset some of the lost business from the decline in passenger flights.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A fire that damaged two Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc battery units at a huge energy storage project in Australia in July was caused by a coolant leak that went undetected during start-up tests, a state watchdog said in a report released on Tuesday.
Safety regulators on Tuesday cleared the so-called Victoria Big Battery project, run by French renewables firm Neoen SA, to resume testing at the site near Melbourne.
However the safety regulator Energy Safe Victoria said it will now determine whether there have been any breaches of the state's electricity safety rules and ""if so, whether enforcement action is warranted"".
Neoen said it is working with Tesla to ensure the 450 megawatt hour energy storage project is ready for the Australian summer, which begins in December. Testing will resume on Wednesday.
""We have taken the time to understand the cause of the incident and we have implemented actions to ensure it will not happen again,"" Neoen Australia Managing Director Louis de Sambucy said.
The fire was first detected on July 30 when smoke was spotted coming out of one Megapack and then erupted into flames, which took several hours to subside. It took three day before fire authorities declared the site under control.
Investigations by several Victoria state agencies found that the fire in the Megapack, a shipping container-sized battery unit, was triggered by short circuits in two locations likely caused by a coolant leak outside the battery compartment. 
The short circuits occurred when the Megapack had been switched off after initial testing, which removed fault protections. That meant the fault went undetected and the fire spread to an adjacent battery compartment.
Actions have been taken to prevent that happening again at the Victoria site and across Tesla's global fleet of Megapacks, Neoen said.
""Through these actions, Tesla has improved the detectability and associated fault protection against these types of rare events,"" Neoen said.
The Victoria Big Battery is one of the world's largest and is seen as essential to preventing blackouts in a market that is increasingly reliant on solar and wind power, especially during heatwaves.
Tesla has not commented on the fire. 

Energy Safe Victoria said it has required Tesla to provide the final results of its investigation into why the fire caused the loss of a second Megapack and what it will do to prevent that from happening again.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Monday said a near-simultaneous release of a top Huawei executive and two Canadians detained shortly after her arrest was not a prisoner swap, but that their cases came up in a call between the Chinese and American presidents weeks before. 
On Friday, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou flew home to China from Canada after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, a point of tension between China and the United States. 
Within hours of the news of the deal, the two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody were released from Chinese jails and were on their way back to Canada. Beijing had denied that their arrests were linked.
When asked if the White House was involved in brokering a ""prisoner swap,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki rejected the premise. 
The deferred prosecution agreement with Meng was ""an action by the Department of Justice, which is an independent Department of Justice. This is a law enforcement matter,"" she said, adding, ""There is no link.""
But Psaki also confirmed that in a call on Sept. 9, two weeks before the announcements, China's leader Xi Jinping brought up Meng's case and U.S. President Joe Biden pressed for the release of the two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, who had been held in China for more than 1,000 days.
""These two leaders raised the cases of these individuals but there was no negotiation about it,"" Psaki said.
Separately, two American siblings prevented from leaving China since 2018 returned to the United States over the weekend, according to a U.S. official. Cynthia and Victor Liu had been subject to an ""exit ban"" despite not facing criminal allegations. Their father, former bank official and fugitive Liu Changming, is wanted in China to face fraud charges.
Psaki said she had no information on whether Biden knew about the status of the negotiations between Meng's lawyers and the Justice Department. 
Meng had been arrested at Vancouver International Airport in Canada on a U.S. warrant, and was indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran.
The years-long extradition drama had been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signaling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate.
BALL IN THE U.S. COURT
Psaki emphasized the deal announced on Friday did not indicate a softening of U.S. concerns about Chinese behavior.
""Our policy has not changed, our policy toward China,"" Psaki said. ""We are not seeking conflict. It is a relationship of competition and we are going to continue to hold the PRC to account for its unfair economic practices, its coercive actions around the world and its human rights abuses,"" she said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China.
Earlier in September, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Biden's climate envoy John Kerry in a virtual meeting that Washington needed to take practical steps to improve relations by responding to a list of demands, which included dropping the case against Meng.
""Right now, the ball is in the United States' court,"" Wang told Kerry, according to a Chinese statement. 
But U.S. officials have rebutted any suggestion that Kerry or other administration officials had negotiated Meng's release with China for other concessions. 
Earlier in the week, Xi announced at the United Nations that China would not build new coal-fired power projects abroad, a pledge Kerry had been pressuring Beijing to make to help the world stay on course to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
""We were not involved in their internal decision-making on it in any way, shape, or form,"" a White House official told Reuters of the Justice Department's process.
""The movement on coal, number one, is, frankly, China acting in its own interest,"" the official said. ""I think they realized that they weren't going to get anything for it. They weren't going to be able to use it as leverage.""
Meng arrived to a hero's welcomed in China, and official media there suggested that her release could be a chance to reboot fraught U.S.-China ties.
While some Republican senators criticized the Biden administration for giving in to Beijing's demands, analysts said that didn't add up.

""I believe that the deal that the PRC made to get Meng released was on the table during the Trump administration. She had to acknowledge wrongdoing and ultimately that is what she did. I don't see capitulation,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.
The Justice Department says it is still preparing for trial against Huawei.

(Reuters) -Endeavor Group Holdings Inc, the owner of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, will acquire sports betting business OpenBet from  Scientific Games  (NASDAQ:SGMS) Corp for $1.2 billion in cash and stock, the companies said on Monday. 
Endeavor, whose shares were up nearly 10% in extended trading, said the acquisition will strengthen its position in the sports betting industry. 
The company said it plans to combine OpenBet, a sportsbook and gaming software, with its existing sports betting business IMG ARENA. 
The deal comes at a time when the online gambling space has been witnessing frenetic dealmaking as more states in the United States are expected to legalize the industry. 
Last week, British gambling firm Entain said it had received a takeover proposal from U.S. fantasy sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), valuing it at $22.4 billion.
Demand for online betting has boomed during the pandemic as customers took to playing from home when casinos and betting shops were off-limits. 
The OpenBet deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, will be financed through $1 billion in cash and $200 million worth of Endeavor's Class A common stock, the companies said. 
Las Vegas-based Scientific Games, known as a major slot machine maker, had previously announced its plan to divest its lottery and sports-betting businesses to deleverage and pivot to a gaming and digital content provider.

""Through the transaction, we would be able to get the ability to have a healthy balance sheet and dry powder to really lean in on games,"" Scientific Games Chief Executive Officer Barry Cottle said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. 
Oakvale Capital and Macquarie Capital advised Scientific Games on the deal, while Raine Group acted as the financial adviser to Endeavor.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co showcased efforts to boost efficiency in its aircraft on Monday, a week after rival Airbus staged a similar conference, as global aviation faces growing political pressure to cut emissions and demands by environmental groups for curbs to air travel.
The U.S. planemaker is just one of many companies in the industry playing up its efforts to make its products more environmentally friendly, though there is debate over the speed at which new technology will be adopted. 
Boeing's event at its flight test hangar in Seattle was anchored by an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 flying demonstrator equipped with potential upgrades like a drag-reducing warning light and cabin sidewalls made from recycled carbon fiber. 
""Many of our improvements come with a lot of small things at once,"" Boeing Vice President of Product Development Mike Sinnett told Boeing employees, industry and government officials and media gathered inside the building.
Aviation produces up to 3% of man-made CO2 emissions and 12% of CO2 from transport, the industry says. It has pledged to reduce net carbon emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050.
Europe's Airbus last year announced plans to develop a hydrogen-powered airplane from 2035.
Boeing conversely has emphasized the expanded use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat, though it does not rule out generational technology leaps.
""Focusing on SAF is really important because there are thousands of airplanes already flying. The airplanes that will go into service for the next ten years have already been designed and those engines have been certified,"" Sinnett told reporters later.
""To have any meaningful impact we are going to have to ... expand the use of sustainable fuels,"" he said, calling hydrogen and other technologies ""a longer-term play.""
Boeing has promised that its fleet would fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030.
SAF at present accounts for only a miniscule amount of overall jet fuel use and jet engines are currently certified to run on up to 50% of the fuel. 

Illustrating the scale of the challenge facing the industry, the world's two largest planemakers in 2020 delivered jets estimated to be responsible for total emissions equivalent to 600 million tonnes of CO2 over their lifetimes, a figure dampened by lower deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing's 737 MAX 9 ecoDemonstrator, the latest configuration in a decade-old test program, is set to fly to Glasgow ahead of a United Nations Climate Change Conference in November, a person familiar with the plan said.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is not looking to buy a movie theater chain, Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos said on Monday, a rejection of speculation that swirled after the world's largest streaming service bought two cinemas.
The company owns one theater in New York, purchased in 2019, and one in Los Angeles, which it bought in 2020. Netflix uses the cinemas to hold movie premieres and to showcase some of its original films. 
Asked at Vox Media's Code Conference if Netflix might next buy a theater chain, Sarandos said ""no."" 
He also said he expected theaters to survive the rise of at-home streaming but that audiences would make fewer trips to their local cinema when they can watch so much programming at home.
""I think (moviegoing) will be less frequent, maybe more expensive,"" he said. ""Using it as an event to get out of the house, people are still going to be looking for that.""
Sarandos also said that the recently released Korean horror series ""Squid Game"" was on its way to becoming Netflix's biggest non-English title so far and could turn into its most popular show yet around the world. 

""We did not see that coming, in terms of its global popularity,"" Sarandos said.
The current most-watched show, measured by total viewing hours, is romantic drama ""Bridgerton,"" Sarandos said. The most popular film to date is Sandra Bullock thriller ""Bird Box.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) Inc, the world's largest cannabis producer by sales, of fraudulently overstating the value of a marketing and revenue-sharing agreement with Authentic Brands Group Inc.
U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan said shareholders failed to show that the Canadian company exhibited ""conscious misbehavior or recklessness"" in trumpeting the agreement, when it knew that regulatory uncertainty over cannabis-based products would dampen customer demand.
""Tilray certainly appears to have overestimated, by orders of magnitude, both the value of the ABG Agreement and the likelihood of fortuitous regulatory change,"" Crotty wrote. ""But being wrong - even embarrassingly so - is not the same as being dishonest.""
Crotty also said shareholders failed to show that former Chief Executive Brendan Kennedy intended to defraud them by arranging a ""downstream merger"" in Dec 2019 between Tilray and his Privateer Holdings Inc to ensure Privateer maintained voting control over Tilray and could reap tax benefits.
The judge said the shareholders could file a new complaint to try to address shortcomings in their case.
Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tilray and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Shareholders sued after Tilray on March 2, 2020 wrote down the value of the ABG agreement by about 86%, or $102.6 million, citing regulatory uncertainty, and reported lower inventory and margins than they expected.
Tilray's share price fell 15% the next day, and went on to fall 84% in half a month, coinciding with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Crotty ruled nearly four months after a Delaware state judge said investors could sue over the downstream merger and pursue a ""fairness review"" because the transaction offered ""unique"" tax benefits to Privateer's founders.

Once the epitome of an era of helter-skelter borrowing and building in China, Evergrande has now become the poster child of a crackdown on developers' debts that has left investors large and small sweating their exposure. 
In a letter to investors seen by Reuters, the Shenzhen Financial Regulatory Bureau said ""relevant departments of the Shenzhen government have gathered public opinions about Evergrande Wealth and are launching a thorough investigation into related issues of the company.""
It is also urging China Evergrande and Evergrande Wealth to work to repay investors, the letter said, which was sent following investor demands for an inquiry. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) made no mention of Evergrande in a statement posted to its website, which contained just a line on housing along with promises to make its monetary policy flexible, targeted and appropriate.
But at a delicate moment for the world's most indebted developer, which missed a bond interest payment last week and has another due this week, its pledge to ""safeguard the legitimate rights of housing consumers"" hinted at the sort of response markets had begun to hope for. 
With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its problems could spread through China's financial system and reverberate around the world - a worry that has eased as damage has so far been concentrated in the property sector.
The PBOC's broad-ranging statement was issued after the third quarter meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee. Its housing line echoed comments from Evergrande's leadership that point to containment efforts and prioritizing small investors in properties ahead of foreign holders of Evergrande debts.
""We expect that any impact to the banking system will be manageable and that the government will instead focus on the social fallout of unfinished housing units,"" said Sheldon Chan, who manages T. Rowe Price's Asia credit bond strategy.
Suppliers exposed to Evergrande payables and domestic bondholders would also take priority over dollar bond holders, he said. 
Evergrande dollar bonds have been trading accordingly, and remained on Monday at distressed levels around 30 cents on the dollar.
Research firm Morningstar listed BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), UBS, Ashmore Group and BlueBay Asset managers as bondholders with exposure to Evergrande in a Friday report which said funds at HSBC and TCW had closed positions.
BlueBay said its position was small and had been reduced through September. Ashmore, BlackRock, HSBC, TCW and UBS declined to comment. 
Evergrande's stock rose 8%, though at HK$2.55 it isn't far above last week's decade-low of HK$2.06 and stock borrowing costs have surged as short sellers pile in.
Shares of Evergrande's electric car unit fell heavily after it warned of an uncertain future.
Work on a soccer stadium Evergrande is building in Guangzhou is proceeding as normal, the company said on Monday.
The focus now turns to whether a coupon payment of $47.5 million due on Wednesday is made, and then to whether China can contain the economic damage if Evergrande collapses.
Its struggles so far to pay suppliers and sell assets have already begun to dent confidence among homebuyers and force sector-wide price cuts, signaling that consolidation - at the very least - looms for the real estate industry. 

""Evergrande's potential credit event, in our view, is part of a 'survival of the fittest' test in China's property sector,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Linan Liu said in a note to clients.
""Allowing orderly exits by weaker players in the property sector, while painful, is necessary to improve overall leverage conditions in the sector and bring about a soft landing.""

U.S.-listed shares of the company, which also posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, were down 2% in extended trading.
After more than three years into Canada's legalization of recreational cannabis, profits have been wearing thin at most pot firms, weighed down by fewer-than-expected retail stores, cheaper rates on the black market and sluggish overseas growth. 
Aurora last week said it would shut down a facility in Edmonton, Alberta, without disclosing the number of employees that would be impacted by the move. 
The company laid off hundreds of employees last year to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, shut facilities and amended its loan agreements.
Net revenue at its consumer cannabis business, its second largest segment, slumped 45% to C$19.5 million ($15.41 million) in the fourth quarter.
The Edmonton-based company's total net revenue fell 20% to C$54.8 million, below Refinitiv analysts' expectations of C$56.28 million. 
Aurora sold 11,346 kilograms of cannabis in the quarter, compared with 16,748 kilograms a year earlier. 

On an adjusted basis, the company lost 68 Canadian cents per share, compared with Wall Street expectations for a loss of 27 Canadian cents per share, according to data from Refinitiv.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 07:18PM ET</span>","Electric supercars need to lose weight, power up and cool down","By Nick Carey and Giulio Piovaccari
OXFORD (Reuters) - Speed has always been paramount for supercar makers, and now they're in the race of their lives to go electric before climate policy cuts their combustion engines.
That's why the likes of Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Mercedes-Benz are turning to startups such as Oxford-based electric motor company YASA for expertise and technology to solve the unique challenges of electrifying the highest-performance vehicles.
Batteries are immensely heavy and electric motors overheat if driven too hard - big problems for a niche industry that charges hundreds of thousands of dollars for lightweight cars capable of screaming round 10 laps of a track at full throttle.
This year Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) bought YASA, which has developed an ""axial flux"" high-performance electric motor that weighs 23 kg (50.7 lb), a fraction of a near-300 kg V12 engine in a Ferrari, and is about the size and shape of a steering wheel. 
YASA already makes motors for Ferrari, Swedish supercar maker Koenigsegg, plus an unnamed British supercar company. It will now supply the high-performance AMG brand at Daimler, which will soon assume the name of its car business Mercedes-Benz. 
Based just a few miles from YASA, Saietta has developed a range of water-cooled axial flux motors. The company is gearing up to produce motors for the vast Asian motorbike market, but told Reuters it had created a larger prototype and was in talks with one hypercar maker, and that two others had expressed interest.
""These manufacturers know combustion engines forwards, backwards and inside out,"" said Saietta Chief Commercial Officer Graham (NYSE:GHM) Lenden. ""But they don't know electric powertrains and what they're looking for is someone to hold their hand."" 
Yet this is uncharted territory, with no clear road map to electric for high-performance vehicles yet. Supercar makers will have to invest billions of dollars to survive the disappearance of combustion engines, with no guarantee that the technologies they adopt will pay off in the long term.
WEIGHT IS THE ENEMY
Supercars and the highest-end hypercars - both sportscars that verge on professional racing level performance - are a highly profitable, capital intensive niche market for automakers. 
Consultancy AlixPartners and data firm IHS Markit estimate more than 152,000 ""luxury"" and ""super luxury"" sportscars ranging in price from 100,000 to 10 million pounds ($137,000-13.7 million) will be sold globally in 2021, with the market expected to rise nearly 50% to 223,000 cars in 2026. 
YASA founder Woolmer said, though, that his company's long-term brief from Daimler was to bring the costs down in future iterations of its motor so the German carmaker can use them across its entire car range as it shifts to electric. 
""Automotive technology doesn't scale to volume overnight, you tend to start with the premium niche sectors,"" Woolmer says.
Makers of high-performance electric cars will ultimately have to find ways to develop lighter, more powerful batteries. But as today's battery technology cannot compete with the sustained power of a petrol engine, they are also rethinking everything from electric motors to car body materials. 
Axial flux electric motors are flat, round devices - dubbed ""pancakes"" - that are lighter and more efficient than conventional cylindrical ""radial flux"" motors, or ""sausages.""
YASA's motor is oil cooled, so will never overheat and is far more efficient than a conventional motor, said Tim Woolmer, who developed the device as part of his doctorate at the University of Oxford and then founded the company in 2009.
Because the motor is more efficient, it can extend the range of an electric vehicle up to 7%, or because it uses less power it allows carmakers to take out some of the heavy batteries and reduce their vehicle's weight by to 10%, he added.
YASA has a small facility at its Oxford headquarters where it makes motors for Ferrari's SF90 Stradale hybrid and 296 GTB hybrid models, and test motors for AMG. Daimler is studying how to scale up that production at its own factories. 
YASA's CEO Chris Harris said its acquisition by the German giant had not ended its work with clients like Ferrari. 
""They want us to continue working with our supercar customers because that's the leading edge,"" he added. ""That technology when it matures cascades down.""
Ferrari's Chief Technology Officer Michael Leiters described the YASA motor in its hybrid models as an ""automotive first"", adding that the Italian sportscar maker would lean on the technical expertise of suppliers in its quest to go electric.
WANTED: BATTERY REVOLUTION
Car companies are also looking beyond motors in their weight-loss plans. 
Mate Rimac, CEO of Croatian electric hypercar maker Rimac, said the chassis and the body of its C-Two model were both made of carbon fibre, and that batteries formed part of the car's structure to save weight. 
The company, which is forming https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/porsche-ag-croatias-rimac-set-up-jv-involving-vws-bugatti-brand-2021-07-05/#:~:text=To%20be%20set%20up%20in,will%20also%20lead%20the%20JV a joint venture with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s luxury sportscar unit Porsche that will include VW's Bugatti brand, also uses ""torque vectoring"" to boost performance - motors in the wheels to help take corners.
British sportscar maker Lotus has developed a new electric platform using light aluminium alloys that cuts the vehicle's structural weight 37% and will start producing its first fully-electric sports car in 2026. 
Owned by China's Geely and Malaysia's Etika Automotive, Lotus also operates as an auto supplier and engineer to other carmakers. The company is in advanced talks to supply the platform to another carmaker and has received expressions of interest from several others, managing director Matt Windle said.
""With the cost and speed of electrification, collaboration is the way to go,"" Windle said. 
Chinese automaker FAW has teamed up with U.S.-based engineering and design firm Silk EV to form the Silk-FAW venture, which plans to build electric sportscars in Italy.
It is using carbon-fibre components for the vehicle chassis and looking to a high-revolution motor using copper-wiring technology from the aerospace sector to cut the motor's weight by 20%, though it is also exploring other options.
""Weight saving is even more important than a higher level of power,"" said Roberto Fedeli, Silk-FAW vice president for innovation and technology. 
Cutting weight and using more efficient motors may be enough for most wealthy sportscar buyers who use their vehicles for recreation or to commute, and are unlikely to want to execute multiple high-speed laps around a race track.
Those who do could be in for a long wait. 
""Unless batteries go through a massive revolution, you're never going to carry the amount of energy that a fuel tank will carry,"" said YASA founder Woolmer. 

""For longer-form racing, it's going to be a while.""

Let’s find out.Shares of the world’s largest entertainment company, The Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS), have gained significantly over the past few years.

(Reuters) -U.S. soybean exports jumped last week to a six-month peak, while corn shipments were the highest in a month as Louisiana Gulf Coast terminals steadily ramped up operations disrupted nearly a month ago by Hurricane Ida, preliminary data showed on Monday.
The export pace remained well below normal for this time of year as some terminals remain shuttered or running at reduced capacity after the storm flooded and damaged some facilities and wrecked the region's power grid.
Ida crippled overseas grain shipments weeks before the start of the Midwest harvest and the busiest period for U.S. crop exports, sending export prices soaring and stoking global worries about food inflation.
On Monday, grain merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co said its Ama and Reserve, Louisiana, terminals and mid-river loading rigs were fully operational, while its facility in Destrehan will be by the end of the week.  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd's, Destrehan terminal was also fully operational after running only ""intermittently"" last week, a company spokesperson said.
Weekly USDA grain inspections data, an early indicator of shipments abroad, showed 11 export vessels were loaded with corn, soybeans, wheat or sorghum at facilities along the lower Mississippi River in the week ended Sept. 23.
That was up from just seven vessels loaded a week earlier but well below the same week a year ago, when 24 vessels were loaded for export at the busiest U.S. grains hub, the data showed.
Weekly corn inspections at all U.S. ports totaled 517,539 tonnes last week, down 37% from the same week a year earlier, while soybean inspections were down 66% at 440,742 tonnes.
Almost a month into the 2021/22 marketing year that began Sept. 1, corn inspections are at less than half of last year's pace, and soybean inspections are at just a fifth of the year-ago rate, according to USDA data.

About 11 bulk vessels were docked and loading at Louisiana Gulf Coast elevators on Monday and nearly 60 more were lined up along the Mississippi River and waiting to load, an industry vessel lineup report and Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed.
Most of the nearly dozen large grain terminals owned by ADM, Bunge, Louis Dreyfus Co and others escaped the storm with minor damage. One of two terminals owned by Cargill Inc sustained the worst damage.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Canada is trying to use the lure of travel perks to convince America's frequent-flying elite to fly north on Air Canada, as the country steps up efforts to revive crucial traffic from the United States, a Canadian official said.
COVID-19 has battered travel from Canada's largest tourism market. During the first half of 2021, Canada had only about 178,000 overnight arrivals from the United States, compared with 6.8 million during the same period in 2019, according to government data. 
To help reverse that decline, government tourism body Destination Canada on Monday rolled out its first campaign targeting U.S. frequent flyers, in partnership with the country's largest carrier. 
It is part of broader, C$14 million ($11.2 million) efforts by the tourism commission to boost traffic after Canada recently opened its borders to vaccinated travellers. It is not clear how much the specific frequent flyer campaign will cost.
""This is super-focused in terms of our ability to reach frequent flyers,"" Gloria Loree, Destination Canada's chief marketing officer told Reuters, ahead of the launch.
Under the plan, up to 20,000 U.S. frequent flyers with carriers like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) could get matching status when flying Air Canada north of the border.
Delta declined to comment and American Airlines did not immediately respond.
Southwest, which does not serve Canada directly, said by email that the government arm's support contributes to the industry's collective efforts ""to restart substantive air travel.""
Frequent-flyer status gives travelers perks like priority boarding that would normally cost a premium fare or a fee. 
While status-matching is common among airlines, Destination Canada said this is the first time a tourism organization has used the practice to attract tourists to their country.
""This is the push to get them coming to Canada,"" Loree said. 
Eligible U.S. frequent flyers who book and travel north on AC before Jan. 15, 2022, will keep their status with the carrier for all of 2022, she said.
It comes as countries ease restrictions on international travel, with the United States set to reopen in November to vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries.
Loree said funding frequent-flyer status matching is no different from other incentives paid for by Destination Canada, such as a separate campaign this year with Air Canada's rival, WestJet Airlines.
Loree said the goal is to restore routes from the United States, while trying to attract travelers who will return to Canada.
In April, hard-hit Air Canada received an estimated C$5.9 billion ($4.7 billion) government aid package with the country gaining a stake of roughly 6% in the carrier. 
While Canada's high vaccination rate could reassure tourists, the cost of the country's COVID-19 PCR test requirements for arrivals could dissuade some travelers, said Frederic Dimanche, director of the Ted Rogers (NYSE:ROG) School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Ryerson University. 
Loree said targeting U.S. frequent flyers is a plus because they are largely accustomed to those requirements.
""They've figured out how to travel,"" Loree said. ""So we want them to consider Canada as their next trip.""

Air Canada shares closed up 3.48% in Toronto trade.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 05:56PM ET</span>",U.S. successfully flight tests Raytheon hypersonic weapon -Pentagon,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said on Monday.
The test took place as the United States and its global rivals quicken their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms. 
In July, Russia said it had successfully tested a Tsirkon(Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world. 
The free flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) occurred last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, said in a statement. 
""This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S. military,"" said Andrew Knoedler, HAWC program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office. There is no target date for that transition, but Knoedler told Reuters, ""we are readying our next vehicles and working toward additional flight tests later in the year.""
Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.
""The missile, built by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), was released from an aircraft seconds before its  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine kicked on,"" DARPA said.
""The DoD (Department of Defense) has identified hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities as the highest technical priorities for our nation's security,"" said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s Missiles & Defense business unit. 
""The United States, and our allies, must have the ability to deter the use of these weapons and the capabilities to defeat them,"" he said.
""Investments in hypersonic strike have begun to pay dividends, answering the progress already made by the likes of Russia and China,"" Tom Karako, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters. 
In 2019, Raytheon teamed up with Northrop Grumman to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons. Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.

""The HAWC vehicle operates best in oxygen-rich atmosphere, where speed and maneuverability make it difficult to detect in a timely way. It could strike targets much more quickly than subsonic missiles and has significant kinetic energy even without high explosives,"" DARPA said in a statement.
Dan Olson, vice president of Northrop Grumman's Weapon Systems Division, said ""decades of learning advanced manufacturing techniques and industry partnerships helped us define what is now possible.""

78,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>",U.S. environment agency urged by 21 states to toughen vehicle emissions rewrite,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of 21 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, and several major U.S. cities urged the Biden administration to finalize significantly stricter vehicle emissions rules than it has proposed.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in August called for reversing the Trump-era loosening of vehicle emissions rules with a new plan to boost efficiency 10% in the 2023 model year and aim for a fleet average of 52 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2026.
But the states and cities want more stringent rules saying automakers have enough time to meet tougher rules.
""There is no need to wait to require further deployment of these technologies or to delay the massive economic and public health benefits of reducing these emissions,"" wrote the state attorneys general, led by California and joined by New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver and others.
""EPA must begin now to address the devastating risks of climate change and the on-going harms facing communities,"" they said.
Other states signing include New York, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) in separate comments also called for greater stringency, arguing the EPA's proposed standard ""is too weak."" 
ACEEE said EPA's analysis showed ""that the proposed rule will only lead to an EV market share of 8% by MY 2026."" 
That was too low to meet President Joe Biden's target of 50% EVs by 2030, it said in its official comments on the proposal.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it backed the ""emission reduction goals"" in the EPA proposal, which it called ""historically stringent"" but did not weigh in EPA's request for comment on whether to hike 2026 requirements.
In March 2020, Trump's Republican administration rolled back the previous Obama administration's standards to require only 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. Obama had required 5% annual increases. 
Trump's rewrite mandated 2026 fuel efficiency of just 43.3 mpg.
The EPA projects Biden's requirements will cost $150 billion to $240 billion through 2025 in higher vehicle costs, but save motorists $120 billion to $250 billion in fuel costs. They will have net benefits of $86 billion to $140 billion including other matters like improved public health and reduced pollution.
EPA said by 2050 the proposal would ""reduce gasoline consumption by more than 290 million barrels"" a nearly 10% reduction.

In 2020, EPA said the Trump plan would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day.
The transportation sector is the largest U.S. source of greenhouse emissions, representing 29% of total emissions. Light-duty vehicles account for 58% of the transportation emissions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co will pay $37.3 million to settle U.S. government claims it fraudulently overcharged commercial clients on foreign exchange services, the latest in a string of scandals over the bank's treatment of customers.
Monday's settlement resolves U.S. Department of Justice civil fraud charges against the fourth-largest U.S. bank, and includes a $35.3 million fine plus a $2 million forfeiture.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) previously returned $35.3 million to customers as restitution, making its total payout about $72.7 million.
The Justice Department said sales specialists jokingly used expressions such as ""back the truck up"" and ""when in doubt, spread them out"" when they were overcharging customers, with one referring to the sales group as a ""bucket shop.""
Wells Fargo declined to comment, pending required approval of the settlement by U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan federal court.
The San Francisco-based bank has been subject since 2018 to a Federal Reserve cap on assets, which must remain below $1.95 trillion until it improves its governance and risk controls.
Wells Fargo has already paid more than $5 billion in fines since the scandals began in 2016.
On Sept. 22, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was closely monitoring the bank's efforts to address ""widespread and pervasive"" problems.
Powell spoke eight days after Massachusetts U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for Wells Fargo to be broken up.
Shares of Wells Fargo closed down 36 cents, or 0.8%, at $47.56.
Monday's settlement resolves claims that Wells Fargo defrauded 771 commercial customers, including many small- and mid-sized businesses, on foreign exchange services between 2010 and 2017.
The government said Wells Fargo systematically charged higher spreads and sales margins than it promised, and encouraged the overcharges by linking specialists' bonuses to how much revenue they generated.
According to court papers, specialists also used what they called the ""big figure trick"" or ""transposition error game"" to cheat customers, such as by charging $1.0213 to buy euros instead of $1.0123, picking up an extra 89 basis points.

A whistleblower, former Wells Fargo foreign exchange trader Paul Kohn, will receive $1.6 million from the bank's payout, the maximum available.
His lawyer, Jonathan Willens, said Kohn had worked on a different desk from where the alleged fraud occurred, but was in the same room and could hear what transpired.

The program, which was finalized in July, will open Oct. 29 for applications through Jan. 14, 2022.
Last year, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats to communications networks - a declaration that barred U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies. The FCC in December adopted rules requiring carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to ""rip and replace"" that equipment.
The issue is a big one for rural carriers that face high costs and difficulty finding workers to remove and replace equipment.
The FCC's final order expanded the companies eligible for reimbursement from those with 2 million or fewer customers to those with 10 million or fewer customers.
The FCC in September 2020 estimated it would cost $1.837 billion to remove and replace Huawei and ZTE equipment from networks.
In June, the FCC voted to advance a plan to ban approvals for equipment in U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies deemed national security threats like Huawei and ZTE. The FCC could also revoke prior equipment authorizations issued to Chinese companies. In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks. 

The affected companies included the previously designated Huawei and ZTE, as well as Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co.
In August 2020, the U.S. government barred federal agencies from buying goods or services from any of the five Chinese companies.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended lower Monday, as tech stocks slipped on a jump in Treasury yields, offsetting a jump in energy and financials.
The S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained0 0.2%, or 71 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.5%.
Energy added to gains from last week as oil prices soared on expectations for tighter crude supplies as energy demand continues to recover.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its 2022-to-2023 Brent price forecast to range of $81 to $85 per barrel from $75 to $65 per bbl, amid expectations for ""reduced OPEC spare capacity as global demand recovers, structural cost inflation across the oil curve and a higher oil price required for US producers to grow given the increase in the cost of capital.""
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Cabot Oil & Gas  (NYSE:COG), and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were up more than 7%.
Financials were boosted by an ongoing bid in bank stocks, underpinned by a climb in Treasury yields as the 10-year Treasury rose above 1.5%, before retreating.
The rise in yields comes as investors bet the Federal Reserve may have to raise rates sooner than many expect as supply-chain issues will continue to boost the pace of inflation.
""New COVID-19 outbreaks have shut factories in Vietnam and China, adding to higher year-over-year raw materials and shipping costs, and ongoing U.S. port delays unloading shipping containers,"" Da Davidson said in a note.

Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), People’s United Financial (NASDAQ:PBCT), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) were up about 5% on the day.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), ended 1% lower amid fears supply chain issues could delay the tech giant's shipments of iPhones.
Sentiment on tech was also sourced by rising rates and inflation.
Investors in growth sectors like tech, which tend to have higher valuations, usually have to wait longer to recoup their investments, which is unattractive in an inflationary environment, where money today, is worth more than money in the future.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government borrowing costs advanced for a sixth week on Monday, hurting tech stocks as investors bet on rising interest rates, while three-year high oil prices ignited the energy sector.
An easing in Sino-U.S. tensions and Chinese authorities' decision to pump in more cash to offset the fallout from real estate firm Evergrande's woes offered encouragement to investors. There was also relief that Germany's election outcome ruled out a pure left-wing coalition government.
U.S. indices were mixed, with the industrials-heavy Dow Jones index outperforming the Nasdaq index of tech stocks.
""Technology stocks are higher valuation, meaning you're paying for future growth, and higher interest rates are a brake on future growth,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""When yields rise, tech shares tend to underperform.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 71.37 points, or 0.21%, to 34,869.37, the S&P 500 lost 12.37 points, or 0.28%, to 4,443.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.73 points, or 0.52%, to 14,969.97.
Europe's STOXX 600 index ended lower as declines in tech stocks offset gains in banks and energy, while German shares hit 10-day highs.
Germany's blue-chip DAX rose 0.3%, leading gains among regional indexes, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2%.
The oil price surge is stoking speculation that global inflation will prove longer-lasting than anticipated, forcing central banks to act and benefiting so-called reflation investments, which rise in tandem with rates.
""All in all, it's a positive story as we have a strong economic macro story underpinning everything,"" said Fahad Kamal, CIO at Kleinwort Hambros in London.
Kamal noted that optimism was reflected in central banks signaling their intent to remove pandemic-era stimulus gradually, which in turn was lifting bond yields.
Oil futures have climbed around $9 a barrel over September.
U.S. crude futures settled up 2% at $75.45 per barrel. Brent crude futures settled at $79.53 per barrel, up 1.8%. 
Coming on top of this year's 300% surge in European gas prices, the price rises risk further inflaming inflation expectations and hastening the end of super-cheap money. 
Graphic: European Gas Prices 2021 - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-GAS/dwpkrdjljvm/chart.png 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecast Brent to hit $90 per barrel by year-end, noting ""the current global oil supply-demand deficit is larger than we expected, with the recovery in global demand from the Delta impact even faster than our above-consensus forecast.""
Investors are, therefore, repositioning portfolios. 
On Monday, U.S 10-year Treasury yields continued their recent march, hitting 1.5% for the first time since June on solid economic data and signals the Federal Reserve is shifting toward a more hawkish policy.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 1.516% in morning trading, its first time above 1.5% since June 29, before falling back as the higher rate drew in buyers. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 1.4889%, from 1.461% late on Friday.
The rise in U.S. yields, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis, is also lifting the dollar. The dollar index rose 0.146%, with the euro down 0.15% to $1.1697.
Gold prices steadied with gains curbed by the stronger dollar and Treasury yields.
U.S. gold futures settled mostly unchanged at $1,752.
Worries persisted about China.
A power supply crunch that is triggering an industrial contraction and pressuring the economic outlook is adding to concerns stemming from property firm Evergrande, which missed a bond coupon payment last week and faces another in coming days. 

Hong Kong-listed shares in Evergrande's electric car unit plunged as much as 26% after it warned it urgently needed a swift injection of cash.
Still, Chinese blue chip shares gained 0.5%, thanks to another cash injection from the central bank and hopes the release of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou would reset ties with the West.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden rolled up his shirt sleeve and received a COVID-19 vaccine booster inoculation on Monday, hoping to provide a powerful example for Americans on the need to get the extra shot even as millions go without their first.
""Boosters are important, but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,"" he said, noting that about 23% of people in the United States have not received a shot.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week backed an additional dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also received a booster shot on Monday. “All Americans should speak with their doctors and get vaccinated,"" he said.
Biden, 78, said his wife Jill would also get a booster shot soon.
In getting the booster, Biden dismissed criticism that the United States should distribute more vaccines worldwide before allowing boosters at home.
""We are helping. We are doing more than every other nation in the world combined,"" he said.
While scientists are divided over the need for booster shots when so many people in the United States and other countries remain unvaccinated, Biden announced the push in August as part of an effort to shore up protection against the highly transmissible Delta variant. 
Only people who received their last dose of Pfizer's shot at least six months ago are eligible for another shot now, U.S. regulators said. The FDA has not yet considered  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s application for boosters and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has not yet applied for one.

U.S. officials have cited a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated"" that state, local and federal officials as well as private employers have tried to counter with mandates to get the shots or, in some cases, face repeated testing. 
Experts continue to push vaccines as largely regional outbreaks of the virus across the United States continue to stress health care systems, which could be further exacerbated by exhausted nurses or doctors or by staff who refuse the shots.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency investment products and funds posted inflows for a sixth consecutive week, as investors viewed recent regulatory challenges in the sector as buying opportunities, data from digital asset manager CoinShares showed on Monday.
Inflows to the sector hit $95 million last week, led by investments in bitcoin of $50.2 million, according to CoinShares data as of Sept. 24. Over the last six weeks, crypto inflows amounted to $320 million. For 2021, inflows were $6 billion.
Bitcoin bore the brunt of negative investor sentiment of the last two quarters. Last week's inflows were just the fourth week of inflows out of the last 17. So far this year, inflows into bitcoin remained robust at $4.3 billion.
On Friday, China's most powerful regulators intensified a crackdown on cryptocurrencies with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto- and blockchain-related stocks.
But analysts said investors on Monday seemed to have shrugged off the news.
""Once again we're seeing some real resilience in bitcoin, which at one stage was pushing $40,000,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London.
Bitcoin was last down 0.2% at $43,108.
Blockchain data provider Glassnode, in its latest research note on Monday, pointed to the ""relatively low utilization"" of the bitcoin block-space,"" which can be both a bearish and bullish signal.
It added that current transactions on bitcoin are at 175,000-200,000 per day, ""which are similar to levels seen in the 2018 bear market.""
CoinShares data also showed ether products had the second most inflows last week at $29 million, as investors looked to further improvements in the Ethereum blockchain.

Ether though on Monday was down 2.1% at $3,000.88.
Assets under management at Grayscale and Coinshares, the two largest digital asset managers, dipped last week to $38.016 billion and $3.671 billion, respectively, pressured by the decline in crypto prices following China's regulations news on Friday.

Investing.com -- Stocks were a mixed bag on Monday, with investors trading big tech for stocks typically linked to economic growth.
Energy jumped more than 3%, and financial and industrial stocks also got a lift with less than half-hour left to the end of the session. Banks, especially, were helped by a rise in the yield on the United States 10-YearTreasury to 1.5%, reaching that level for the first time in months. 
Last week the Federal Reserve suggested it could begin unwinding its monthly bond-buying program by as soon as November, and may raise interest rates in 2022, as the economy continues to make progress on recovery from the pandemic.
In remarks released Monday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said the central bank’s highest priority was making sure millions of unemployed Americans find jobs.
""Putting Americans back to work...to me that's our highest priority,"" Kashkari said at the Community Foundations Leading Change Fall Forum, Reuters reported. 
Kashkari also said the Fed will pay close attention to inflation, and that recent high readings do not signal permanently higher inflation, he said, according to Reuters.  ""We don't want to overreact to short-term price movements.""
This week brings a bunch of economic data points that can help guide investors on the state of that recovery, including inflation, manufacturing, and jobless claims. For a splash of drama, Congress this week must pass a government funding provision or risk a default and government shutdown.
The broad S&P 500 was on track to break a seven-month streak of gains for the month, nonetheless. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1 Chip update
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), a maker of chips and data storage technology, is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $2.33 on revenue of $8.22 billion. Analysts will be listening for any updates on progress as companies the world over await the end of a global chip shortage.
2. Confidence reading
Consumer confidence is likely to have improved in the current month with CB Consumer Confidence expected to have moved up to 114.5 from August’s 113.8. The report is released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
3. Housing costs

93,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 03:18PM ET</span>",Protein found on infected cells protects virus from immune system; remdesivir helps prevent hospitalization,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Virus-infected cells protected from immune system by protein
A protein called CD47 that helps damaged cells avoid destruction by the immune system may be contributing to severe cases of COVID-19, researchers believe. Drugs in development targeting CD47 may result in improved COVID-19 therapies, they suggested in a report published in Current Issues in Molecular Biology. ""We may have identified a major factor associated with severe COVID-19,"" coauthor Martin Michaelis of the University of Kent said in a statement. ""We can now look forward to further progress in the design of therapeutics."" In lab experiments, the researchers found that CD47 - which in effect tells the immune system, ""Do not eat me!"" - is present in increased amounts on the surfaces of cells infected with the coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 infection also increases levels of another protein, SIRPalpha, that partners with CD47 to trick the immune system into ignoring the sick cells. Previous studies have shown that CD47 levels are also elevated in conditions that put people at higher risk for critical illness from COVID-19, such as old age, diabetes, high blood pressure, and clogged blood vessels. In these groups, ""high CD47 levels may predispose... to severe COVID-19,"" the researchers said. ""Further research will be needed to define the roles of CD47 and/or SIRPalpha in COVID-19 in more detail,"" they added. 
Remdesivir keeps high-risk patients out of the hospital
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s intravenous antiviral drug remdesivir helped keep high-risk COVID-19 patients out of the hospital in a randomized trial, the company announced. The 562 patients in the study all had conditions that increased their risk for becoming critically ill. Half received three days of treatment with remdesivir - sold under the brand name Veklury - while the rest received a placebo. Four weeks later, 5.3% of patients in the placebo group had been hospitalized or died, compared to 0.7% of those who received remdesivir. That translated into an 87% lower risk of hospitalization or death. Remdesivir-treated patients also had significantly fewer medical visits, the company said. The drug is currently authorized for emergency use in hospitalized patients. ""These latest data show remdesivir's potential to help high-risk patients recover before they get sicker and stay out of the hospital altogether,"" study leader Dr. Robert Gottlieb of Baylor University Medical Center said in a statement. His team plans to formally report the data at an upcoming medical conference.
Pandemic cuts life expectancy by most since WWII

The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced life expectancy in 2020 by the largest amount since World War II, with the life expectancy of American men dropping by more than two years, according to new data. In the 29 countries studied - the United States, Chile, and 27 in Europe - all but two showed reductions in life expectancy. There were greater drops in life expectancy for men than women in most countries. ""The large declines in life expectancy observed in the United States can partly be explained by the notable increase in mortality at working ages observed in 2020,"" study co-leader Ridhi Kashyap of the University of Oxford said in a statement. ""In the United States, increases in mortality in the under 60 age group contributed most significantly to life expectancy declines, whereas across most of Europe increases in mortality above age 60 contributed more significantly."" The largest declines were found in U.S. men, who saw life expectancy drop by 2.2 years relative to 2019, followed by a 1.7-year decline for Lithuanian men. Women in the United States and Spain had drops in life expectancy of 1.5 years or more. Overall, men had more than a year shaved off in 15 countries, compared to women in 11 countries. Females from 15 countries and males from 10 ended up with lower life expectancy at birth in 2020 than in 2015, the research team reported on Sunday in the International Journal of Epidemiology.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc will invest $50 million to partner with organizations to responsibly build the so-called metaverse https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26 - a digital world where people can use different devices to move and communicate in a virtual environment, it said on Monday.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the world's largest social network, has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies. The company has been criticized over its impact on online safety.
The new XR Programs and Research Fund will invest the money globally over two years to ensure metaverse technologies are ""built in a way that's inclusive and empowering,"" Facebook said. 
The company said it plans to work with researchers across four areas including data privacy and safety, to allow users to get help if something they see in the metaverse makes them uncomfortable.
It will also research how to design technologies that are inclusive and accessible to all users, and also ""encourage competition"" in the nascent industry, Facebook added in a blog post.
Facebook has faced scrutiny on a wide range of internet issues, such as the spread of disinformation and social media's negative impact on teens.
Also on Monday, Facebook said it paused development on Instagram Kids, an app that would have provided age-appropriate content for kids under 13. U.S. lawmakers and advocacy groups have cited safety concerns and urged Facebook to drop the launch plans.
A Facebook executive will testify on Thursday at a U.S. Senate committee hearing on the impact of its Instagram app on young users' mental health.

Initial partners for Facebook's new metaverse fund include Howard University in Washington D.C., which will research the history of diversity in the information technology industry and how it could shape opportunity in the metaverse.
Seoul National University and the University of Hong Kong will research safety, ethics and responsible design, Facebook said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -FedEx Corp investors approved billionaire Chief Executive Fred Smith's $54 million pay plan on Monday at the delivery company's annual meeting, but rebuffed the corporate board's recommendations on shareholder proposals on lobbying and outsized executive severance packages.
Investors approved by more than 50% non-binding proposals for more disclosures on the company's lobbying and for shareholder voting on senior management severance packages that pay out more than roughly three times salary and bonus, known as ""golden parachutes.""
The investor support is part of a sea change this year as top funds throw more of their weight behind shareholder challenges to companies on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.
""It is clear mainstream investors have had enough with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and its exposure to dark money politics,"" said Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which sponsored the lobbying proposal. ""Partial disclosure only begs the question: what are you hiding?""
FedEx said in an emailed statement it would ""consider the results of the vote as it evaluates (its) disclosure and compensation practices.""
The Teamsters labor union, which has been bargaining on behalf of FedEx employees at a freight facility, had also urged that investors reject Smith's pay. The union said his pay package amounted to ""double dipping"" because Smith received stock options instead of a cash bonus last year after the pandemic hit, and then was also awarded the cash bonus. 
FedEx said in a supplementary securities filing this month that the board's compensation committee made ""decisions in real-time, based on the best information available.""

The lobbying proposal asks FedEx to prepare a report updated annually on its political expenditures at local, state and federal levels. FedEx said it supported business and regulatory actions that further its business objectives. 
The severance payout proposal, submitted by investor John Chevedden, says investors should be protected from golden parachute payouts.

Peas are a key ingredient in some alternative proteins, where demand is growing. At the same time, European pea supply was hurt by adverse weather, while a drought in Canada cut pea output there by 45%, causing prices to more than double from last year, France’s Roquette Freres SA said.
“The dramatic increase in prices will inevitably lead to costs being transferred to customers,” Roquette said in a statement on Monday. The company has also been hit by high energy prices. 
Demand for alternative proteins has expanded in recent years as climate change and health concerns drive consumers to products like plant-based burgers. Roquette’s warning of higher prices also comes as food costs in general are near the highest in a decade amid harvest worries, higher shipping costs and supply-chain disruptions. 
Beyond Meat didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The biopharmaceutical company is focused on pulmonary and hematologic diseases. The company aims to develop medicines that selectively target multiple ligands (proteins) in the TGF-beta superfamily, which play critical roles in the development of serious diseases.
The TGF-beta superfamily are secreted proteins involved in development and a range of vital cellular processes, including signaling, differentiation, metabolism, protein synthesis, motility, and invasion in a microenvironment-dependent manner.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro derivatives clearing was shifting from London to Frankfurt, showing how ending a heavy reliance on Britain after Brexit is feasible, a senior Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) official said on Monday.
The European Union is due to decide by year-end on how to shift clearing in euro denominated swaps to Frankfurt from the London Stock Exchange's LCH arm, which accounts for about 90% of the activity.
""It's not a question of if liquidity moves, but a question of by how much and when,"" said Philip Simons, global head of fixed income derivatives at Deutsche Boerse's Eurex derivatives arm told the IDX conference in London.
""We have seen very little change,"" countered LCH head Daniel Maguire.
Britain wants its temporary permission to clear euro swaps for EU customers until June next year made permanent. Brussels says the status quo is unsustainable, though financial firms are opposed to mandatory relocation.
The EU wants direct oversight of trillions of euros in euro clearing, saying it's a financial stability matter, but Maguire said LCH is already directly regulated by the bloc's securities watchdog ESMA.
""Forcibly fragmenting liquidity is really going to increase the financial stability risk rather than decreasing it,"" Maguire said, adding it would reduce choice and competition and leave customers in the EU with poorer prices and narrower liquidity.
""The debate needs to move - and it is doing - to focus on how can the EU authorities have a say in global markets and have a seat at the table on how they are run,"" Maguire said.
Emma West, EMEA head of futures & options at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), said being forced to close positions in London and reopen them elsewhere would cause some market disruption.

Bill Stenning, head of public affairs in Britain at French bank SocGen said access to Britain is needed to offer a full, cost-effective global service to customers given that 75% of euro swaps are traded outside the bloc.
""There are plenty of products available in the UK that are not available in the EU,"" Stenning said.

The securities regulator said it charged a Florida resident and his friend for allegedly using a form of market manipulation called wash trading to collect rebate payments from exchanges as retail traders piled into ""meme stocks"" - stocks being actively promoted on social media.
The SEC said Suyun Gu devised a scheme to illegally profit off of so-called ""maker-taker"" pricing offered by exchanges, in which resting orders that provide liquidity by executing against other orders receive a rebate payment, by trading options contracts with himself using various brokers.
""In addition to collecting these ill-gotten rebates, the wash-trading scheme allegedly impacted the market as it skewed the volume in certain option contracts and induced other traders to place trades in otherwise illiquid option contracts,"" the SEC said.
Gu executed around 11,400 trades with himself, netting more than $668,000 in rebates, while his friend, Yong Lee, executed around 2,300 trades with himself, netting more than $50,000 in rebates, the SEC said. 
Gu and Lee chose put options on meme stocks that were far out of the money, meaning the strike price was well below the underlying stock price, to trade against themselves because retail interest in those stocks was sending the prices higher, making put options less attractive, the regulator said. 

In March, two brokers closed Gu's and Lee's accounts over wash-trading concerns but Gu continued the scheme through mid-April by lying about his trading strategy, using accounts in other peoples names and accessing accounts through virtual private networks to hide his activity, the SEC said. 
Attorneys for the individuals did not respond immediately to request for comment.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>","Google, in fight against record EU fine, slams regulators for ignoring Apple","By Foo Yun Chee
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -Alphabet unit Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Monday blasted EU antitrust regulators for ignoring rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it launched a bid to get Europe's second-highest court to annul a record 4.34-billion euro ($5.1 billion) fine related to its Android operating system.
Far from holding back rivals and harming users, Android has been a massive success story of competition at work, representatives of Google told a panel of five judges at the General Court at the start of a five-day hearing. 
The European Commission fined Google in 2018, saying that it had used Android since 2011 to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet search. 
Regardless of how the court rules, Google, Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will have to change their business models in the coming years to ensure a level playing field for rivals following tough new rules proposed by European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.
""The Commission shut its eyes to the real competitive dynamic in this industry, that between Apple and Android,"" Google's lawyer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Pickford told the court.
""By defining markets too narrowly and downplaying the potent constraint imposed by the highly powerful Apple, the Commission has mistakenly found Google to be dominant in mobile operating systems and app stores, when it was in fact a vigorous market disrupter,"" he said.
Pickford said Android ""is an exceptional success story of the power of competition in action"". 
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan dismissed Apple's role because of its small market share compared with Android.
""Bringing Apple into the picture doesn't change things very much. Google and Apple pursue different models,"" he told the court.
Khan cited Google's agreements which forced phone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search, the Chrome browser and the Google Play app store on their Android devices, and payments to pre-install only Google Search as conduct that did not allow for competition.
He said Google's dominance as an incumbent and the immense barriers for rivals resulted in ""a virtuous circle for Google but a vicious circle for anybody else"".
Android, free for device makers to use, is found on about 80% of the world's smartphones. The case is the most important of the European Union's three cases against Google because of Android's market power. Google has racked up more than 8 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in the last decade.
German phone maker Gigaset Communications GmbH, which is backing Google, said its success as a European smartphone maker was due to Android's open platform and lamented the negative impact of the Commission's decision on its business.
""The licence fee for the Play Store that Google now charges as a result of the contested decision represents a significant portion of the price of Gigaset's smartphones aimed at price-sensitive consumers,"" its lawyer Jean-François Bellis told the court.
Lobbying group FairSearch, whose complaint triggered the Commission case, was however scathing about Google's tactics with phone makers.
""Google adopted a classic bait and switch strategy. It hooked (them) on a supposedly free and open source operating system subsidised by its search monopoly, only to shut that system to competition through the web of restrictions at issue in this case,"" its lawyer Thomas Vinje told the court. 

A verdict may come next year. The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

The below graphics show the exposure of asset managers to the Chinese firms stocks and bonds and how they have performed.
On the equities side, various Vanguard funds held a combined $40 million or so worth of shares as of August, Refinitiv Eikon, data showed, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) held at least $13 million across its iShare MSCI emerging market ETFs.

Evergrande bondholders also include some of the world's biggest asset managers, according to the latest data published by Morningstar Direct on holdings of U.S. and cross border funds, as well as Asian bond funds. 
The debt is held by funds run by asset managers such as UBS, Fidelity, PIMCO as well as emerging markets focused asset manager Ashmore Group, the data showed.

Some of the funds had raised Evergrande exposure in July and August even as unease grew over its financial situation, Morningstar found. 
Shares in Evergrande have recouped some recent losses after the firm announced on Wednesday it had struck a deal to settle interest payments on a domestic bond. It reassured retail investors on Thursday that they were a top priority.
On Monday, stocks ended the day more than 8% higher. However, the stock has plunged 83% this year, the fourth-biggest decline among Asia's large and mid-cap companies, according to Refinitiv data.

Evergrande missed a $83.5 million coupon payment deadline on a dollar bond last week and its silence on the matter has left global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when a 30-day grace period ends. 

Yield on that bond maturing March 2022 hit a record high of 636% on Wednesday, compared to 13.7% at the start of the year. It was trading at 570% on Monday.

(Reuters) - Two-time Olympian gymnast and sexual abuse survivor Aly Raisman is sharing her story of resilience and healing in a new television special, ""Aly Raisman: Darkness to Light.""
    In the three-hour, two-part special Raisman recounts her journey to recovery and speaks with various survivors and experts on sexual abuse, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke.
    While she said she found the process of producing the special healing and rewarding, Raisman recalled being physically drained.
    ""I would be like laying on the couch or just in between interviewing survivors, and I just felt so sick and so tired,"" she told Reuters. ""I'm trying to navigate how I can prevent from feeling like that, but also recognizing if I do feel like that, it's OK to feel like that.""
   Raisman, who won six medals in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, recognizes the pitfalls of her current passion.
    ""It has truly affected my personal life of speaking up about this,"" she said.
    On Sept. 15, Raisman, along with fellow gymnasts Simone Biles, McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols, told a U.S. Senate panel how FBI failures allowed USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to continue sexually assaulting other girls and young women for more than a year.
Nassar was eventually tried and sentenced in January 2018 to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts who were entrusted to his care.
    Raisman, 27, expressed frustration that more has not been done to investigate USA Gymnastics or the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) for covering up Nassar's abuse for years. She wants a thorough independent probe to hold the sports bodies and FBI accountable.
    ""It's scary to think about how many people knew that he was an abuser and didn't do anything. And that's what's really important for people to understand, is that it really took a village to protect a pedophile,"" she said.
""Without the answers, we can't believe in a safer future and we don't know if there are still people working there or working with other children that covered up our abuse,"" Raisman added.
    The USOPC issued a statement saying it has implemented reforms after hiring a law firm to conduct an independent investigation.
    Six years after first speaking out, Raisman said she is learning to love gymnastics again.
    ""I basically lived in the gym,"" she said. ""There were some days I would train up to six to seven hours. I was so exhausted and just put everything I had"" (into it).

""And so, I also think that some of the people in the sport who really let us down, it was really hard for me to ... separate that from my love from gymnastics.""
    ""Aly Raisman: Darkness to Light"" will air on the U.S. cable network Lifetime on Sept. 24. Lifetime is a unit of A+E Networks, a 50–50 joint venture between Hearst Communications and The Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.

Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer headquartered in Shenzhen, owes $305 billion and has run short of cash, triggering concerns its problems could ripple through China's financial system.
As its liquidity crisis deepened, the company's wealth arm earlier this month missed a payment on wealth management products (WMPs), leading to protests by investors who fear they will never get their money back.
In a letter to investors seen by Reuters, the Shenzhen Financial Regulatory Bureau said ""relevant departments of the Shenzhen government have gathered public opinions about Evergrande Wealth and are launching a thorough investigation into related issues of the company"".
It is also urging China Evergrande and Evergrande Wealth to work to repay investors, the letter said, which was sent following investor demands for an inquiry.
Neither Evergrande, nor the government of Shenzhen replied to requests seeking comment. 
China Evergrande, in common with other heavily-indebted conglomerates, issued high-yielding WMPs to investors - a popular way of borrowing that sidesteps government lending restrictions.

More than 80,000 people – including Evergrande employees, their families and friends as well as owners of Evergrande properties - bought WMPs through Evergrande that raised more than 100 billion yuan ($15.47 billion) in the last five years, and some 40 billion yuan of the investments are outstanding, a sales manager of Evergrande Wealth and investors said.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italian luxury car maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and its parent company Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding vehicle of the Agnelli family, are joining forces with with Jony Ive, the creative mind behind many of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iconic products, and fellow designer Marc Newson.
The duo - who together developed Apple Watch - belong to the LoveFrom creative collective of designers, architects writers, engineers and artists based in London and California. 
LoveFrom will explore ""a range of creative projects with Exor in the business of luxury"" in addition to the collaboration with Ferrari, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday. The partnership is a multi-year deal.
A Ferrari spokesman said the pair will have a broad remit - potentially involving both car designs and other businesses including fashion. 
Ive had been mentioned in the Italian press among possible candidates to replace Louis Camilleri when he suddenly stepped down as chief executive of Ferrari last year. 
In the end Ferrari turned to technology industry veteran Benedetto Vigna to drive the luxury sports car maker known for its roaring, high-octane engines into a new era of silent, electric powertrains.
In a sign of its ambition to widen the appeal of its brand, Ferrari in June unveiled its first in-house fashion collection and inaugurated a new restaurant in its hometown of Maranello. It hopes its brand extension strategy will account for 10% of its profits in a decade. 
Meanwhile Exor has recently moved its first steps into luxury. Last year it became the largest shareholder in Chinese luxury group Shang Xia, co-founded by France's Hermes, and in March it took a 24% holding in high-end shoemaker Louboutin for 540 million euros. 
More recently, it entered a partnership to invest in Italian high-end consumer goods with The World-Wide Investment Company Ltd, one of Hong Kong's oldest family offices.

With a financial war chest of 2.5 billion euros available for acquisitions to 2023, Exor is often mentioned as a potential partner for bigger fashion brands such as Giorgio Armani.
London-born Ive, 54, left Apple in 2019 after 27 years, having played a big role in the designs of the iMac and MacBook computers as well as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Newson, an Australian, has designed everything from Qantas business class seats to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) sneakers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG on Monday said it has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle environmental claims with the states of New Hampshire and Montana over updates of emissions software arising from the 2015 diesel cheating scandal.
The settlements, about $280 per vehicle, are a small fraction of what the states initially sought. The German automaker and several courts previously have cited astronomical figures as maximum liability the German automaker faces over the issue of whether states can enforce emissions laws over updates to emissions software after the vehicles were sold.
VW will pay New Hampshire $1.15 million and it pledged to build another high-speed charging station in the state by 2024. VW has agreed to pay Montana $357,280.
New Hampshire had sought up to $25,000 per vehicle per day and Montana sought up to $10,000 per violation per day. The settlements with the two states announced Monday cover about 5,500 vehicles.
VW last month asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an Ohio court ruling that cleared the way for the state to move forward with its diesel emissions lawsuit. 
The German automaker earlier said in court papers Ohio’s claims alone ""could total $350 million per day, or more than $127 billion per year, over a multi-year period.""
Three remaining states - Illinois, Ohio and Texas - and two counties - Hillsborough County, Florida, and Salt Lake County, Utah - have filed suit involving about 47,000 vehicles. 

If the other states and counties settled for $280 per vehicle, the total would be just $13 million.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) previously settled U.S. actions prompted by the emissions scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from local and state government liability, an appeals court found.

(Reuters) -Swedish electric-car maker Polestar said on Monday it will go public by merging with a U.S.-listed blank-check firm backed by billionaire Alec Gores and investment bank Guggenheim Partners at an enterprise value of $20 billion.The deal with Gores Guggenheim will provide Polestar cash proceeds of over $1 billion, including $800 million from the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and a PIPE, or private investment in public equity, of $250 million from institutional investors. 
Shares of Gores Guggenheim pared some earlier gains and were up over 4% in morning trading.
The deal comes at a time when large SPAC mergers have become rare, as the business of blank-check dealmaking deteriorated rapidly over the summer after investors were spooked by the poor financial performance of many SPACs and a regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over their disclosures.
Polestar, founded in 2017 by Volvo Car Group and China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, also counts Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its investors.
The premium EV maker's offering includes two models: a hybrid car known as Polestar 1 and a fully electric Polestar 2. It previously said it has another model in development called the Precept, which is a larger sedan.
Polestar delivered about 10,000 vehicles globally last year and expects to sell about 290,000 vehicles per year by 2025. It predicts it will rake in $1.6 billion in revenue this year and double that number next year. 
RIDE ON EV BOOM
The company's listing plan comes as automakers shift their focus to environmentally friendly vehicles amid rising pressure from lawmakers and investors concerned about climate change.
Polestar joins other EV makers in the public market, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid Motors, which went public in a $24 billion SPAC deal in February.
Polestar touts an asset-light business model as a key differentiator by having existing productions lines provided by backers Volvo and Geely, so it can focus on investing in research. 
""We don't need the capital to build the factory. We can put the money raised into developing the technology and the market,"" Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar's chief executive, said in an interview. 
The company raised $550 million in external funding in April and announced plans in June to build Polestar 3 electric sport utility vehicles at Volvo's U.S. plant in South Carolina beginning next year.
Current equity holders of Polestar, who will roll their entire interest in the combined company, will retain about 94% ownership, it said. 
Volvo said on Monday it will make additional equity investments in Polestar of up to $600 million and is expected to hold about 50 percent of the combined company.

SPACs are publicly listed companies that are raised with the intention of merging with a private company at a later date. For the company going public, a SPAC merger serves as an alternative to a traditional IPO. 
Once the deal is completed, Polestar will trade under the ticker symbol PSNY on the Nasdaq.

Tesla shareholders will cast ballots on Oct. 7 on cutting director terms to two years, eliminating a supermajority vote requirement to approve certain changes, and who will sit on the electric car maker's board. Tesla is currently valued at $766 billion. 
""Votes AGAINST directors James Murdoch and Kimbal Musk are warranted due to concerns regarding excessive compensation to named executive officers and to non-executive directors,” ISS wrote in a report sent to clients last week.
Murdoch, who was chief executive officer of 21st Century Fox and is the son of media magnate Rupert Murdoch, and Kimbal Musk, a restaurant entrepreneur and brother of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, are both running for re-election to the board. The board currently has nine members but will have eight after the annual meeting because director Antonio Gracias is not running again.
ISS said shareholders should reject Murdoch because he serves on the audit and governance committees. The governance committee failed to react appropriately to last year's majority supported shareholder proposal and the audit committee signed off on pledging a significant amount of company stock to certain directors, raising questions about its risk oversight, ISS wrote. Kimbal Musk does not serve on any board committees.
Kimbal Musk and Murdoch have been part of Tesla's since 2004 and 2017, respectively.

Investing.com – Gannett stock (NYSE:GCI) rose 4% on Monday after the company announced another round of refinancing of its existing debt to bring down its interest costs.
The subscription-led digital media company will issue up to $550 million in senior secured notes, targeting a rate of 500 basis points over LIBOR (which is currently around 0.13%). That compares with a coupon of 7.75% for the bonds it issued in a January refinancing.
Gannett Holdings, a fully-owned subsidiary of the company, would be the borrower and lenders are likely to be funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Capital Management.
The company behind USA Today expects to end the quarter with its 5-year term loan principal under $900 million and to have approximately $130 million of cash and cash equivalents. The loan stands at $925.7 million as of now.
The company now expects its adjusted earnings margin in the third quarter to be approximately 12% to 13% compared to around 13.7% in the first half of 2021. The company said inflation in newsprint and delivery as well as the resurgence of the pandemic are hurting the margins. It said they have affected circulation revenue and the events business, including the ability to host in-person endurance races and local community events."
125,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",British warehouse worker shortage triggers up to 30% pay spike,"By James Davey and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Warehouses in Britain are having to pay up to 30% more to recruit staff after a chronic shortage of workers exacerbated pressure on already buckling supply chains and threatened to derail the run up to Black Friday and Christmas.
The warehouse trade group and a recruitment agency for the sector said they were struggling to replace the European staff who used to arrive for the festive period and work in warehouses and distribution centres.
Clare Bottle, CEO of the UK Warehousing Association, said her members had reported having to increase pay by between 20% and 30% to secure workers for entry level jobs. 
With around 200,000 people working in warehousing, she said: ""The problem is big. I would say we're tens of thousands short."" 
Jordan Francis, commercial director of the Prodrive recruitment agency which supplies around 35 warehouse companies in southern England, said he already had around 100 vacancies he was struggling to fill. 
He is offering a 25% increase in pay for a standard warehouse operative role. While he can secure more workers at that rate, he said the higher pay meant workers were less willing to do overtime. 
""We've never seen a market like this,"" he said, adding that his former European workers had opted to go to France or Germany, where they do not need visas. 
The shortages in Britain's logistics network come on top of a spike in European natural gas prices and a post-Brexit and COVID shortage of truck drivers that has left the world's fifth-largest economy reeling. 
""I can't honestly think of a time in the last 20 years when labour intense UK industries have faced a problem like this,"" said one senior executive of a major British retailer, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Temporary warehouse labour is the critical problem. To deal with the two peak trading periods of Black Friday and Christmas, retailers need workers to join from late September and work for between four weeks and four months.
Last year the shortfall was made up by people furloughed by the COVID-19 pandemic taking on part-time jobs. However, the furlough scheme closes at the end of September. 
The retail sector's shift to online from physical stores also means more labour is needed in warehouses than ever. 
The crunch is being particularly felt in areas with a heavy concentration of warehouses and distribution centres, for example Milton Keynes and Northampton in central England.
Jobs website Totaljobs shows thousands of warehouse roles being advertised in that region. Compared to a national British minimum hourly wage of 8.91 pounds ($12.19) that entry level roles would have previously been offered at or around for over 23s, jobs were being offered at between 9 and 13 pounds per hour, with evening work offering a 60 pound bonus. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR SHOPPERS 
Executives said Britain's major supermarket groups and blue chip general merchandise retailers would cope better than others due to their deep pockets and higher levels of automation but smaller players would struggle.
The senior retail executive said that for online shoppers, standard delivery times could be extended from around five days to seven or 10 days. A withdrawal of premium next-day delivery services could follow.
The executive said stores could also rationalise their online product ranges, dropping low value items that require a disproportionate amount of warehouse labour.
""If you're highly manual and you've not invested in any automation at all, you're wildly exposed to this,"" the executive said, adding that consumers could expect to see longer delivery times and some items unavailable for online order from early November if the situation did not improve.
The pay hikes are not confined to Britain, despite the specific issues there. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has increased its average starting wage in the United States and plans to hire another 125,000 warehouse and transportation workers, an executive told Reuters this month.
U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) meanwhile said staffing problems had resulted in a $450 million year-on-year increase in costs due to higher wage rates and overtime, increased spending on third-party transportation services and shipping glitches.
Britain's warehouse industry warned that operators already had low margins and price rises would need to be passed on.
""There's very little give in those margins, most warehouse companies and particularly the smaller ones keep their overheads very low, they have very flat management structures, really a big proportion of the cost that they pass on are labour costs,"" said the trade association's Bottle.

""If the labour costs go up, there's really nowhere to go.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Monday, as a rise in bond yields - driven by a combination of concerns around U.S. fiscal and monetary policy - weighed on most equity valuations.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to touch 1.50% for the first time in three months before the stock market opened, against a backdrop of rising tension in Washington, D.C., over the funding of the federal government and President Joe Biden's economic policy agenda.
By 9:45 AM ET  (1345 GMT), the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1% and the S&P 500 was down 0.3%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 195 points, or.0.6%, at 34,993 points, supported by banking stocks and energy stocks, the latter of which profited from a spike in prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, crude oil.
'Reopening trades' were back in vogue, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rising 3.2% and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) stock rising 5.8%, while bank stocks - which perform well when rising bond yields allow them to fatten their lending margins - were also all positive. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2.3%,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 1.6% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 2.8%.
Such trades appeared to be funded at least in part by rotation out of technology names, which have had a second wind during the summer as the spread of the Delta-variant of Covid-19 blew the economy's reopening off-track for a while. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)stock fell 2.3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.9% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell 1.7%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 1.3% after the company said it would pause work on Instagram Kids, following a public outcry at revelations about the company's governance, notably its failure to react to internal analysis showing the negative impact of Instagram on teenagers' mental health.
 Gores Guggenheim  (NASDAQ:GGPI) stock rose 2.3% after the SPAC said it will take luxury EV maker Polestar, a unit of Volvo Cars, public through a merger that values the company at $20 billion including debt.
Elsewhere, Gannett (NYSE:GCI) stock rose 3.6% to test a two-year high after saying it will refinance at least $500 million of debt with a new issue of senior secured notes, bringing down the USA Today's debt servicing costs still further. 
Energy stocks rose across the board, lifted by a surge in natural gas prices as both Europe and China scramble for liquefied natural gas cargoes to cover their heating needs.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.8% while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 2.6%. Services firms were also well sought, with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) stock rising 4.9%, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock rising 5.0% and  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) stock rising 3.6%."

Ireland capped executive pay at 500,000 euros ($552,300) a year during the euro zone's costliest banking rescue more than a decade ago. It banned all forms of variable pay and fringe benefits for even junior bank staff, restrictions lenders complain impedes them in attracting and retaining talent.
Bank of Ireland Chief Executive Francesca McDonagh said on Monday this had left the country's largest bank by assets at a competitive disadvantage to other companies and fellow members of the stock exchange which are not restricted in the same way.
""Myles' decision to leave the Irish banking sector highlights the challenge that remuneration restrictions represent for Irish banks in attracting and retaining talent,"" McDonagh said in a statement. 
""The normalisation of our operations is now vital to the long-term sustainability of the indigenous banking sector,"" she said.
O'Grady will remain in his position until he joins Musgrave in April 2022, the food retail, wholesale and foodservice company said in a statement. Musgrave owns the country's largest supermaket chain, SuperValu. 
O'Grady's predecessor, Andrew Keating, left the bank two years ago to take up a senior financial role at Irish building materials supplier CRH (NYSE:CRH).
In 2018, former Allied Irish Banks Chairman Richard Pym described Ireland's banks as a training ground for rivals after his bank lost its chief executive and chief financial officer within weeks.

The Irish government, which pumped 64 billion euros or almost 40% of annual economic output into its banks following the 2008 global financial crisis, has said it has no plans to ease the restrictions.
It still retains a majority stake in AIB and permanent tsb and is selling down its 12% holding in Bank of Ireland.

However, investor uncertainty about a $22 billion acquisition deal with a British sports betting firm and current class-action lawsuits related to the merger are casting a pall over the company’s growth prospects. So, the question is, will the stock be able to recover from its recent price decline? Read ahead to learn more.
Sports betting operator DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) delivers digital sports entertainment, sports betting, and iGaming products . The company went public on April 24, 2020, through a reverse merger with blank-check company  Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp . Its recent launch of an NFT ecosystem—DraftKings Marketplace—to give sports fans access to digital collectibles from top athletes has driven its shares up 10.2% year-to-date. But DKNG’s stock price has declined 9.1% over the past month and 23% over the past six months. Closing yesterday’s trading session at $51.33, its stock is trading 31% below its 52-week high of $74.38.
Moreover, DNG is currently trading lower than its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $54.15 and $55, respectively, which indicates a downtrend. Although the expansion of its online Sportsbook in new markets could help grow its customer base and further improve fan engagement, several class-action lawsuits filed against the company could foster bearish investor sentiment.
Further, its proposed takeover of British gambling firm Entain, which already has a joint venture with MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), requires MGM’s consent. The uncertainty surrounding the deal could lead to the stock experiencing more dramatic price swings in the near term.

""Helping parents with childcare and encouraging staff to regularly take time off to rest are a priority for Credit Suisse,"" it said in a statement, citing increasingly diverse family configurations and the need for regular breaks from work.
The move comes as banks consider whether traditional working conditions are still relevant as they look to attract a more diverse workforce.
Maternity or adoption leave for the primary caregiver will be 26 weeks, while paternity or adoption leave for the secondary caregiver will increase to six weeks from 12 days currently. 
If both parents work at Credit Suisse, they can split 10 weeks of parental leave as they choose after the 16th week of maternity leave, or over the full leave period for adoptions. 
If managers approve, both types of leave can be taken in the form of part-time work within a year of the birth or adoption.
The bank will also grant additional days off to longstanding staff. After five years, staff can take an extra five days of paid leave, rising to 10 days after 10 years, then 15 days every five years. Swiss workers typically get five weeks holiday a year.
Members of senior management who are at least 50 years old and with at least 10 years of service can also take a sabbatical of two or three months on a reduced salary. 

""We view our conditions of employment as a conscious and strategic investment that pays off not only for our employees, but also for the bank and our clients,"" said Claude Täschler, head of human resources for Credit Suisse Switzerland.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) fell 0.8% in Monday’s premarket trading as the social media giant decided to pause work on Instagram Kids to build parental supervision tools for it, first.
The company has for long been accused of neglecting the impact its popular apps has on young adolescents, a claim it disputes. Development of an app for an even younger group of kids was thus causing even greater anxiety among parents, something the company claims to be redressing now.
According to the company, it was developing a new version of its popular app to address the challenges posed by children misrepresenting to be teenagers when they were not. The company was relying on the app’s ability to identify the age, a feature that was exploited by children.
It now wants to give parents control of how their children use the app.. During this time, it said it will “listen to parents, experts, policymakers and regulators to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.""
“We firmly believe that it’s better for parents to have the option to give their children access to a version of Instagram that is designed for them — where parents can supervise and control their experience — than relying on an app’s ability to verify the age of kids who are too young to have an ID,” Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, said in a blog post on the company’s website.
Mosseri said the new version of the app was never meant for younger kids, but for tweens (aged 10-12).  It will require parental permission to join, it won’t have ads, and it will have age-appropriate content and features, he wrote.
Facebook’s move comes after deep research by journalists at The Wall Street Journal showed that Instagram use was leading to high anxiety, mental-health, body-image and confidence issues in teenage girls.
The WSJ said the company is “acutely aware that the products and systems central to its business success routinely fail”. The documents also show that Facebook has made minimal efforts to address these issues and plays them down in public, the WSJ report said.
Mosseri disputed the claims made by WSJ.  "

The state-owned manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), has been unable to get timely help from suppliers and has run out of some spare parts, those people said.
As of December 2020, the U.S. has required special licenses to export parts and technology assistance to any company with ties to the Chinese military. That has thrown a monkey wrench into the C919 programme, which has been in development for 13 years - one of the longest such periods in aviation.
U.S.-linked suppliers are gradually receiving the licences, but the hiccup has slowed down Chinese certification, and months-long delays threaten to affect early production, said the people, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
COMAC has 815 provisional orders, but only China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) placed a firm order for five jets.
The state-backed airline said in August it expects to receive its first C919 by the end of the year, two in 2022 and two more in 2023.
A slow production rampup would mean the C919 will not pose a near-term threat to Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which produce dozens of narrowbodies a month.
""One of the biggest hurdles is going to be the supply chain, especially now with inflation, material availability and supplier changes,"" said aerospace supply chain expert Alex Krutz at U.S-based aerospace consultancy Patriot Industrial Partners.
""The suppliers may not have the liquidity to make the post-certification changes or be willing as they were a few years ago to continue supporting an initial lower-rate production programme like COMAC,"" he added.
COMAC is years behind its initial certification schedule - one reason it did not take the C919 to the China Airshow.
""COMAC are very preoccupied with test flights. They're behind schedule and are flying as much as they can to reach the minimum hours needed for Chinese certification,"" an industry source told Reuters. ""Despite all the issues, COMAC is very determined to get certified, as this is a paramount political task.""
Sources say that the C919 is likely to receive its type certificate from China's aviation regulator by the end of this year, but that there will be a long list of limits on flight operations. Even after the certification, COMAC must make upgrades, the sources said. 
COMAC and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not respond to requests to comment. 
CAUTIOUS REGULATOR
The sources with knowledge of the C919 programme said the jet's progress seemed to mirror the certification pattern and slow production of its predecessor, the ARJ21 regional jet.
The ARJ21 faced a 2.5-year gap between obtaining a ""type certificate"", which declares the design safe, and a ""production certificate"" allowing it to enter mass production. 
That contrasts with the West, where those certificates are typically granted around the same time.
About 60 ARJ21 aircraft have been delivered to date, but the production ramp-up was also slow, rising from two planes a year in 2017 to 24 in 2020, according to COMAC data. 
The C919 is in a phase called ""batch production"", where each plane requires a sign-off by the regulator.
FOREIGN PARTS
The C919 is assembled in China but relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics. That has made it vulnerable to crackdowns on key technology transfers.
The addition of two key COMAC subsidiaries to a list of companies with military ties in December 2020 created bureaucratic licensing requirements.
China has been doubling down on developing its own engine for the C919; state engine maker Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) will display a model of the CJ-1000 engine at the air show, but the domestic solution for the airliner is years away.
AECC is spending 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) to build an industrial complex in the southwestern city of Chengdu to manufacture engine nacelles and thrust reversers, local media reported last month. A source with knowledge of the matter said the complex related to CJ-1000 production. 

The nacelle capacity is expected to reach 100 per year, enough for 50 planes, the reports said, though no target date was stated. AECC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s customers will have to wait for a few more weeks to lay their hands on the new iPhone 13 as supply chain delays and strong demand lead to one of the longest waiting times for the phone in recent years, analysts said.
The delivery time for Apple's iPhones after a new launch is watched by analysts as one of the measures to gauge demand for the flagship phone's newest model. But this year, it is also shining a light on supply chain issues plaguing technology companies ahead of the holiday shopping season.
Analysts at J.P.Morgan and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said customers across the world who had pre-ordered the new models online would have to wait more than four weeks for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max and about 2 weeks for the base iPhone 13.
In the United States, which accounts for over a third of iPhone shipments, the delivery time for the iPhone 13 series was 19 to 34 days in the second week, compared with 7 to 20 days in the first week, both greater than the lead times for the iPhone 12 Series.
Apple was not immediately available to comment on the delays in delivery times.
""While admittedly part of the expansion in the lead times is on account of the supply chain constraints, we still find the material increase in the lead time in Week 2 relative to Week 1 as an indicator of the robust demand for upgrades, likely exceeding low investor expectations into the launch,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said.
Apple's partners Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) UK and Best Buy cited high demand and product supply issues in replies to customers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Many users on social media also flagged the delays.
""With a delay on the delivery for iPhone 13 pro max I might as well cancel! They talking (about until) October 30th,"" one user said on Twitter https://twitter.com/Chico_DeBarge_/status/1440044634244206593.

On Sunday, several Apple and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc suppliers suspended production at some Chinese factories for a number of days to comply with tighter energy consumption policies, putting supply chains at risk in the peak season for electronics goods.
The iPhone 13, priced between $699 and $1,599, comes with a sharper camera, a new bionic chip and improved connectivity. It has been available for pre-booking since Sept. 17.

Gu Gang, the group's party secretary and leader of the government-led working group addressing HNA's liquidity issues, disclosed the investment at a meeting of its creditors, the two sources who were familiar with the meeting's discussions said.
He did not elaborate on where the investment was coming from but said about 25 billion yuan of the strategic investment would go to Hainan Airlines to replenish its cashflow, they said, asking not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the press. 
Reuters reported earlier that the meeting was planned for Monday and that HNA would reorganise the 11 entities as one group.
HNA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Hainan Airlines said in a separate statement on Monday that it would use funds from strategic investors and future operating income to repay the debts of the airline and of the other 10 entities.
In the 2010s, HNA used a $50 billion global acquisition spree, mainly fuelled by debt, to build an empire with stakes in businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.
But its spending drew scrutiny from the Chinese government and overseas regulators. As concerns grew over its mounting debts, it sold assets such as airport services company Swissport and electronics distributors Ingram Micro to focus on its airline and tourism businesses.
HNA was placed in bankruptcy administration in February and a working group created by the government of its home province of Hainan has been addressing the company's liquidity problems.
Late on Friday, the company said its chairman and chief executive had been detained by Chinese police over suspected criminal offences.
Gu also told Monday's meeting that Hainan Airlines had worked out a debt restructuring plan with major domestic and overseas aircraft lessors, which had given substantial exemptions on its debts, the sources said.
Hainan Airlines' interest-bearing liabilities will fall to 60 billion yuan after the reorganisation, its total assets will stand at 170 billion yuan and its debt ratio will lower to 81% after the debts are cleared, they said. 
A document detailing HNA's restructuring plan had said that creditors of the 11 entities have reported that they are owed 397.2 billion yuan ($61.43 billion) of unpaid debt. Only 161.29 billion yuan of this has been recognised by the court and will enter the restructuring process.
Unsecured creditors that are owed no more than 100,000 yuan ($15,465.01) in principal debt will be repaid in full. Any debt above that level will be paid partly by HNA and other parties, and partly in Hainan Airlines' shares, according to a document seen by Reuters. 

The creditors' committee still must approve the plan, the document said.

Investing.com – Rolls Royce (LON:RR) stock (OTC:RYCEY)  climbed nearly 11% in London on a double boost from a new order to supply new B-52 engines and the sale of its ITP Aero unit to Bain Capital.
The company will supply 650 engines from its F-130 family over 30 years to equip the United State Air Force’s B-52 'stratofortress' planes, a valuable, long-term order that promises steady cash flows for the group's military aviation unit.  
In a separate announcement, Rolls-Royce said it will sell 100% of its Spanish-based unit ITP Aero for approximately €1.7 billion (around $2 billion) to a consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity. The Spanish company will remain a key long-term strategic supplier to Rolls-Royce, according to a note by the latter.
Rolls-Royce said the transaction, expected to close in the first half of 2022, will help rebuild its balance sheet and support medium-term ambition to return to an investment-grade credit profile. The company closed the first half of 2021 with net debt of 3.1 billion pounds (around $4.25 billion).
The twin announcements add to more good news for the company that was announced last week, when the U.S. announced it would ease restrictions on transatlantic travel, allowing access to vaccinated passengers arriving from the EU and U.K.. The U.K. for its part also announced an easing of testing requirements for passengers arriving from abroad. Shares of airline companies, Rolls-Royce’s biggest clients, have bounced since the announcements.

LONDON (Reuters) -German discount supermarket group Aldi will invest 1.3 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in Britain over the next two years, opening a new store every week to try to accelerate its rapid growth in market share, it said on Monday.
The retailer plans to open another 100 new stores in Britain, expand its logistics infrastructure, including a new distribution centre in central England, and invest in technology.
It will create more than 2,000 new British jobs next year, adding to the 7,000 permanent roles created over the past two years.
""Around 88% of British consumers want to shop in stores ... There's no doubt that bricks and mortar is the focus for our business,"" Giles Hurley, the CEO of Aldi's business in Britain and Ireland, told reporters.
Aldi and German rival Lidl have grown rapidly in Britain over the last decade, forcing the established big four supermarkets - Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's Asda and Morrisons - to cut prices and compete more aggressively. 
Aldi is now Britain's fifth-largest supermarket group. It currently trades from 920 UK stores and has an 8% market share.
However, its share edged lower at some points during the pandemic, partly due to a lack of a significant online business.
The British and Irish business, privately-owned by Aldi Sud, said 2020 sales rose 10.2% to a record 13.5 billion pounds, but operating profit fell 1.2% to 287.7 million pounds, reflecting the costs of COVID-19.
The crisis prompted the business to accelerate its push into home delivery via a partnership with Deliveroo. It also introduced a click-and-collect service that's now live in 200 stores, and is trialling a checkout-free concept store in Greenwich, southeast London.
BETTER PLACED
Hurley said although no UK retailer could be immune from current supply chain disruption, Aldi was better placed than rivals.
Aldi's limited product range means it has a smaller supplier base, while the majority of products it sources for its British stores come from local suppliers and manufacturers.
""That means our supply chain is just that little bit shorter and easier to control,"" he said.
Hurley also noted that the majority of its drivers are directly employed.
""It's very much business as usual. Yes things are tighter but our trucks and our deliveries are rolling across the UK, our stores are full and we'd encourage customers to shop as normal,"" he said.
The CEO said nobody in the market could guarantee there would not be inflation this Christmas.

""What I am able to guarantee is that customers will always get the lowest prices in Aldi irrespective of what the future holds.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is to start offering insurance to small and medium-sized UK business customers, the technology giant's first foray into business insurance in the country, broker Superscript said on Monday.
Members of Amazon's Business Prime programme will be able to buy cover from Superscript such as contents insurance, cyber insurance and professional indemnity insurance https://gosuperscript.com/business-insurance/office-insurance, which a Superscript spokesperson said would be underwritten by ""major UK insurers"". They will be offered a discount of 20% to current rates as a way of enticing businesses over to them. 
More than 50% of customers are prepared to buy insurance from non-traditional players such as big tech or insurance technology (insurtech) firms, according to a recent survey of 12,000 people globally by consultants Capgemini.
""The (insurance) industry needs to bridge the divide between insurers and customers by providing a quick, smooth buying process that is customer-centric,"" Cameron Shearer, co-founder and CEO of Superscript, said in a statement.
Amazon's move into UK business insurance comes after U.S. insurtech Next Insurance said in March it was offering cover to U.S. small businesses via Amazon Business Prime.
""As businesses come out of the pandemic and gradually resume normalcy, we want customers to have the best-in-class tools to run their business,"" Molly Dobson, Country Manager for Amazon Business UK & Ireland, said in the statement.
Financial institutions are worried that tech firms will steal their business, trading on the tech players' stronger brand names and ease of access to their products. 
But industry sources said insurers or banks and tech firms are more likely to forge partnerships than compete directly, given the difficulties and expense for outsiders in entering the highly regulated finance sector. 

Amazon also offers warranty insurance and ""buy now, pay later"" services in Britain.

It was the ninth loss in succession for the airline, an affiliate of AirAsia Group Bhd. 
The net loss for the April-June period widened to 24.6 billion ringgit ($5.88 billion), from a 305.2 million ringgit loss a year ago.
The airline said it made an accounting provision of 23.8 billion ringgit to its creditors during the quarter as it is in default under the contract terms.
Revenue dropped 20.9% to 72.3 million ringgit, versus 91.4 million ringgit.
In a stock exchange filing, it said the impact of the provision should be temporary.
""The contractual liabilities for which the provision is made will be waived upon a successful completion of the proposed debt restructuring exercise,"" it said.
To reduce costs, the airline group plans to operate a reduced fleet and return excess aircraft to the lessors. It said it has returned one aircraft and is in discussions with other aircraft lessors ""to achieve the optimal fleet size"". 
Discussions to reduce future lease rental rates are ongoing, as are talks with other service providers to reduce maintenance costs.
The airline, which is looking to convene meetings with creditors to propose a restructuring scheme by the end of October https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/with-progress-creditor-talks-malaysias-airasia-x-targets-end-oct-meetings-2021-09-17, proposed last October to restructure its 64.15 billion ringgit debt into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit.
It said it is making good progress in negotiations.
The implementation of a fund-raising exercise involving a rights issue and a share subscription for new investors to raise 500 million ringgit, will start provided the upcoming creditors' meeting approves it, it said.
AirAsia X also plans to apply for a government guaranteed loan of up to 500 million ringgit, it said.

The group at the end of last year changed its financial year end from Dec. 31 last year to June 30 this year.

Investing.com – Evergrande stock (HK:3333) closed 7.6% higher in Hong Kong trading Monday as the Chinese central bank repeated its determination to keep market conditions orderly, although the fate of the debt-laden Chinese real estate developer remained uncertain.
The company missed a payment deadline on a dollar bond during the previous week, triggering the start of a 30-day grace period. Interest on its 9.5% March 2024 dollar bond is due Wednesday, however. 
Shares of the beleaguered company are down 83% this year.
 Evergrande  has liabilities of around $305 billion and is scrambling to raise funds to service them. The parent group's troubles sabotaged a planned share sale by the group's electric car unit on Monday: shares in China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group crashed 26% after it warned of an uncertain future unless it got a swift injection of cash.
Shares of another Chinese developer,  Sunac  China Holdings (HK:1918), closed 8.5% lower in Hong Kong after it sought “special policy support” from authorities in eastern Shaoxing because operations in the city have become difficult.  "

BEIJING (Reuters) -The release of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou shows China's strength and Canada should ""draw lessons,"" China's foreign ministry said on Monday, after state media called it an opportunity for a reboot of bilateral relations. 
Meng landed in Huawei's home city of Shenzhen aboard a government-chartered plane on Saturday to much fanfare, ending her near three-year U.S. extradition fight, the same day two Canadians detained by Beijing shortly after Meng's 2018 detention returned home. 
Meng's return shows the ability of the Chinese government and ruling Communist Party to protect its citizens, companies, and interests, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular daily briefing.
The two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who had been imprisoned on espionage accusations, left China within hours of Meng's release from house arrest.
The cases involving the Canadians were ""completely different"" from Meng's, which was a case of ""political persecution,"" Hua said.
""Canada should draw lessons and act according to its own interests,"" she added.
Canada had called the arrest of the two an act of ""hostage diplomacy,"" a characterisation China repeatedly denied.
The Global Times late on Sunday said that Kovrig and Spavor had ""confessed their guilt"" and were released on bail for medical reasons before departing China.
Spavor was accused of supplying photographs of military equipment to Kovrig and sentenced to 11 years in jail in August. Kovrig had been awaiting sentencing.
Meng's release was an opportunity to improve relations with Canada and the United States but ""toxic political rhetoric"" could still ""poison"" the atmosphere"", China's Global Times tabloid said earlier on Monday.
""The relaxation of positions by both sides is a positive but limited development in China-U.S. relations and is less than significant in the big scheme of things,"" said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Beijing’s Renmin University.

""There is no indication that Washington is going to soften on the trade war,"" Shi said. ""I don't see China immediately relaxing trade restrictions against Canada either.""
Meng was allowed to go home after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors on Friday to end a bank fraud case against her.

If not prolonged, the scheme would expire this week. It is unclear whether the 27 EU states will support the proposal, which requires a qualified majority to be adopted.
""Discussions are ongoing with member states, so we cannot comment further,"" the spokesperson said. If extended, the scheme would remain in place until the end of the year. 
The scheme has already been extended twice after its initial launch at the end of January, despite criticism from some smaller states that feared it was not necessary and could damage the bloc's competitiveness.
Under EU rules, the Commission could appeal against a possible rejection by EU governments.
The EU Commission established the mechanism amid the bloc's vaccine supply crisis and in a bid to curb exports by pharmaceutical companies deemed not to be respecting their commitments with the EU.

The mechanism has, however, allowed the export of hundreds of millions of shots made in the EU towards dozens of countries around the world.
It has been formally used to block only one shipment of 250,000 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) doses to Australia in March, after the Anglo-Swedish firm cut supplies to the EU.

Investing.com – ADRs of European energy majors were trading higher in Monday’s premarket as oil prices strengthen and natural gas prices surge to seasonal highs ahead of the winters.
BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (NYSE:RDSa) and TotalEnergies ADRs (NYSE:TTE) were up 2.5%-3.5% as supply chain issues, a lack of truck drivers, booming demand and the onset of winter all combined to push energy prices to levels not seen for years now.
The STOXX Oil & Gas index climbed 1.8% to hit a three-month high as Brent futures headed for $80 per barrel amid supply concerns. Brent prices for December delivery traded 1.3% higher at $78.25 at 0600 ET. Prices have climbed more than 8% in September so far.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global oil demand is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by early next year as the economy recovers, although spare refining capacity could weigh on the outlook, producers and traders said at an industry conference on Monday.
The outlook is in line with a bullish forecast https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/vaccines-set-unleash-pent-up-oil-demand-iea-2021-09-14 from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), but ahead of estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Global demand is seen rising to 100 million barrels per day https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/appechess-sees-oil-demand-climbing-100-mln-bpd-by-year-end-or-early-2022-2021-09-27 (bpd) by end-2021 or in the first quarter of 2022,  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) President Greg Hill said.
The world consumed 99.7 million bpd of oil in 2019, according to the IEA, before the COVID-19 pandemic hammered economic activities and fuel demand. 
While a persistent rise in COVID-19 cases across markets has hurt recovery in demand for some refined products such as jet fuel, consumption trends of petrol and diesel indicate growth, industry leaders noted at the Platts APPEC 2021 conference.
""We witnessed a lot of demand destruction as a consequence of reduced economic activity, disruption to transportation, disruption to free flow of goods ... But that's past us,"" said Alan Heng, interim CEO of Singapore's Pavilion Energy.
""We are dealing with the post-pandemic period and we are learning to live with the virus ... Energy demand has started to pick up and that's good news for us.""
Recovering demand is expected to boost profits for refiners and create room for returning or new production, but experts warn that spare refining capacity would be a drag.
""There's still a lot of unutilised capacity and a lot of capacity has been taken off stream,"" said Eugene Leong, president of BP (NYSE:BP) Singapore and CEO of BP's trading & shipping arm of Asia Pacific and the Middle East.
""The spare (refining) capacity is probably going to act as a little bit of a cap on margins,"" he said. 
""This year alone we've seen some mega refining (and) petrochemical complexes start up, so I think that's going to be challenging for refining.""
In China, new mega refiner Shenghong Petrochemical is set to start trial operations soon, while Zhejiang Petrochemical completed two new crude units this year. 
Malaysia's Petronas also hopes to restart operations at its 300,000 barrels-per-day refinery-petrochemical complex with  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) by year end, said Arif Mahmood, Petronas' executive vice president and CEO of downstream.
GLOBAL DEMAND RECOVERY
Brent crude futures have jumped more than 50% this year to their highest since October 2018, helped by a recovery in fuel demand and tighter supplies from the OPEC and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+. [O/R]
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects oil prices to hit $90 per barrel https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/goldman-expects-oil-prices-hit-90-by-year-end-supply-tightens-2021-09-27 by year-end. Prices are below $80 now.
The OPEC sees global oil demand averaging 100.8 million bpd in 2022, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, while the IEA expects it to average 96.1 million bpd in 2021 and 99.4 million bpd in 2022, versus 90.9 million bpd in 2020.
Indian refiner Nayara Energy hopes to operate its 400,000 bpd refinery at close to 100% capacity in 2021 as fuel demand picks up, CEO Alois Virag said.
India's fuel demand is likely to rise by 9%-11% as its economy is ""steered towards higher growth"" after the easing of the second wave of COVID-19 infections, he said.
""When it comes to refining, petroleum products, we remain cautious,"" said Petronas' Arif, adding that travel curbs continue to weigh on aviation fuel demand recovery.

""We'll see recovery hopefully towards the end of this year, early next year,"" Arif said, adding ""there's oversupply of refining capacity"".
However, in the longer term, a global push towards electrification of road transport to reduce carbon emissions may cut demand for the world's oil refining capacity by half in 2050, consultancy Rystad Energy says.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it was fining Grant Thornton 4 million pounds ($5.47 million) but would cut it to 2.34 million pounds due to mitigating factors, as well as imposing non-financial measures to improve its procedures.
The FRC said Grant Thornton's audits during 2015, 2016 and 2017 missed ""red flags"" and failed to stand back and challenge the management of the cafe chain, whose collapse FRC said led to the closure of 70 stores and more than 900 job losses.
David Newstead, Grant Thornton's audit partner for Patisserie Valerie, was to be fined 150,000 pounds, falling to 87,750 pounds, due to mitigating factors.
The fines are low compared with record or near record double-digit sums that bigger accounting rivals have paid out in recent years following other corporate collapses as the watchdog sought to fend off criticisms of being too soft.
The FRC said it took Grant Thornton's ""size, financial resources and financial strength"" into account in determining the level of sanctions. The accountants provided an ""exceptional level of co-operation"" with the investigation, it said.
Grant Thornton had a net income of 471 million pounds in 2020, with an underlying trading profit of 72 million pounds, up 14% on the prior year.
""We regret the quality  of our work  fell short of  what was expected of us  in this instance,"" Grant Thornton said.
""Since the period in question, we have invested significantly in our audit practice to  better ensure  consistent  quality and have started to see the material outcome of this investment,"" it said in a statement.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office is investigating Patisserie Valerie, having arrested former finance director Chris Marsh and several others.
Grant Thornton said it would continue to rigorously defend the civil claim brought by Patisserie Valerie's liquidators, which ""ignores the board's and management's own failings in detecting the sustained and collusive fraud which took place"".

""We recognise that there were shortcomings in our audit work; however, our work did not cause the failure of the business,"" Grant Thornton said.

Mainland property and casualty insurance companies and reinsurance companies can set up special-purpose entities in Hong Kong to raise funds from bond sales, according to a statement of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). 
The arrangement can help diversify insurers' losses from natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and typhoons, it said. 

Devastating summer floods in the populous province of Henan in central China this year sent a wake-up call for Chinese authorities to seek better insurance cover against natural disasters.
The CBIRC said in July that it would guide insurers to increase investment in natural disasters insurances, enrich product offerings, as well as raise public awareness of risks to let natural disaster insurance play a greater role in national emergency response.

Morrisons set the date for the hotly contested deal to be voted on, however with rival bidder Fortress Investment Group yet to walk away, a ""competitive situation"" exists and the Takeover Panel could step in and require an auction to take place.

British water utilities had been struggling with a sharp drop in non-household consumption and rising defaults during the early stages of the pandemic. However, trends have improved since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in mid-July. 
United Utilities said underlying profit would rise despite higher costs due to inflationary pressures.
In May, the utility firm predicted marginally lower revenue for the year ending March 2022, because of regulatory changes in inflation accounting.

Earlier this month, Burgan Bank received preliminary approval from Kuwait's central bank to issue up to $500 million in senior unsecured bonds and last week received approval from the Capital Markets Authority.
The bonds will be issued under Burgan's Euro Medium Term Note Programme. They are expected to have a fixed coupon rate for five years then a floating rate for the final year to maturity, should the bank not ""call"" the bonds.

Closing the bond sale will allow Burgan ""to reinforce its long-term liquidity and regulatory liquidity ratios,"" it has said in an exchange filing.
Sales of senior bonds are relatively rare from the Gulf's banks, but Burgan's debt-raising plans follow the country's biggest lender, National Bank of Kuwait, securing $1 billion this month via six-year senior bonds non-callable for five years.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou arrived in China on Saturday ending her near three-year U.S. extradition fight, the same day two Canadians detained by Beijing for more than 1,000 days returned home.
Meng https://www.reuters.com/business/huawei-heir-apparent-prepares-life-after-three-years-canada-court-battle-2021-09-24, the daughter of Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei, was allowed to go home after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors on Friday over fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran.
HSBC stock rose as much as 3.5% to HK$41.10 in their biggest intraday percentage gain since May 28. HSBC was the second-biggest gainer in the Hang Seng Finance Index. The stock was up 2.1% in the afternoon trade. 
""Anticipation that the bank's mainland business may benefit from the easing tension provides an additional support to HSBC,"" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Group, adding bank stocks were being broadly supported by rising U.S. Treasury bills.
HSBC, whose mainland and Hong Kong operations accounted for 39% of its annual $50.4 billion in revenue in 2020, declined to comment.

The extradition drama had been a central source of discord between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signalling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate. 
The agreement opens U.S. President Joe Biden to criticism from Washington's China hawks who argue his administration is capitulating to China and one of its top companies at the centre of a global technology rivalry between the two countries.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 01:31AM ET</span>",Analysis: Europe's IPO market roars back to life but where are the SPACs?,"By Arno Schuetze, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Toby Sterling
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European stock market listings have come back with a bang after the summer lull but blank cheque firms are nowhere to be seen.
So far this quarter, 42 initial public offerings (IPOs) in Europe have raised $8.5 billion, the highest amount for a decade, but there hasn't been special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal since July, according to Refinitiv data.
The SPAC frenzy in the United States during 2020 and the first half of 2021 was widely tipped to spill over to Europe but despite a flurry of activity before the holiday season, the market appears to have fizzled out.
""The SPAC IPO market is almost dead,"" said German entrepreneur Christoph Gerlinger, who considered setting up a SPAC but has shelved those plans to focus on his job as a private equity manager investing in technology firms.
A SPAC is a blank cheque firm that raises funds in an IPO with the aim of merging with a private company. Once that happens, the target becomes a listed stock, sidestepping the traditional IPO route which is heavily regulated.
SPACs became one of Wall Street's hottest investment trends last year as many retail investors stuck at home during COVID-19 lockdowns placed speculative bets on them. 
In Europe so far this year, SPAC issuance peaked in the second quarter with 15 deals raising $3.7 billion, followed by seven more in July worth $1.4 billion, but there have not been any since, the Refinitiv data showed.
Overall, 26 SPACs have listed in Europe this year, raising $6.6 billion. Over the same period in the United States, 433 new SPACs have raised $118 billion.
The last time there were more European IPOs in a third quarter was in 2007 with 99 deals and the amount raised was the highest since 2011, when IPO proceeds came in at $9 billion, according to the Refinitiv data as of Sept. 24.
SELECTIVE ISSUES
SPACs offer companies such as technology firms with high growth potential but little near-term visibility on revenue and profit an avenue to raise funds in a less onerous way than a full-blown IPO.
They also offer profit opportunities for SPAC sponsors - usually well-known entrepreneurs - as well as investors, who get the chance to buy into private companies via the stock market rather than less liquid venture capital funds. 
But SPAC sponsors and bankers say demand has dried up in the face of poor performance, a regulatory crackdown https://reut.rs/3m6ezlU in the United States, and waning market sentiment.
The European Union's markets watchdog also warned in July https://reut.rs/3kB5dyF that SPACs might not be for everyone due to risks of dilution, conflicts of interests and uncertainty as to the identification and evaluation of the target company.
""I only expect selective new issues of quality SPACs coming to market,"" said Christoph Stanger, co-head of equity capital markets in EMEA at U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
In the third quarter globally, only 85 SPACs listed, raising $14 billion, down from 309 SPACs raising $95 billion in the first quarter, according to the Refinitiv data.
While some investors in U.S.-listed shell companies made fortunes overnight when the shares surged, many who held onto their investments are nursing losses.
""When an investor can buy an existing SPAC at a discount to list price it's less attractive to buy a new SPAC,"" said one equity capital markets banker. 
HOMETOGO DEBUT
In Europe, shares in the first company to be created via a SPAC merger this year started trading last week, but with a whimper rather than a bang.
German travel tech startup HomeToGo, the target of Lakestar SPAC I, backed into the Frankfurt stock market on Sept. 22 by completing its union with the listed shell company.
HomeToGo's shares edged higher on the day, but were still 10% lower than the price Lakestar listed in February and 33% below the peak the shell company's shares hit that month.
European companies such as air taxi startup Lilium, car seller Cazoo, payments firm Paysafe and Global Blue, electric vehicle charging firm EVgo and cyber security company Arqit have all successfully gone public in the United States via SPAC deals. 
But most are below their SPAC issue price, with a few notable exceptions such as Arqit. Globally, about 60% of SPACs that have bought their target company are now trading below their issue price, analysts say.
There was a different mood in the spring when the buoyant U.S. market triggered the start of a European SPAC wave. 
Tikehau Capital-backed Pegasus Europe raised $606 million in April followed by Hedosophia European Growth which raised $483 million, both listing in Amsterdam. 
Then the market started to cool as investors realised the hunt for targets was pushing up valuations, making investments less attractive, analysts said.
""Investors are currently unwilling to buy into new SPACs while there are 423 SPACs with $131 billion in raised capital out there waiting to find takeover targets,"" entrepreneur Gerlinger said. 
HERE TO STAY?
German investor Primepulse, for example, explored a SPAC deal this year and held some meetings with investors, but has said it decided to drop the project due to waning demand.
Many of the SPAC mergers that did get done also struggled in the final stretch as some shareholders opted to redeem their money rather than staying invested after the merger. Lilium, for example, had redemptions of 66% while it was 37% for Hometogo.
That meant SPAC managers had to put more of their own money into deals, forfeit lucrative compensation or abandon the mergers altogether. And SPACs that don't seal a merger within two years of their IPOs have to return the money to investors.
Rene van Vlerken, head of listing at Euronext Amsterdam - which has attracted a number of Europe's SPAC deals - said the current weakness would eventually be overcome.
""There are a lot of SPACs in the market, all looking for attractive business combinations. The market is waiting for a number of good acquisitions by European SPACs,"" he said. 

Giacomo Ciampolini, head of EMEA Alternative Capital at Citi, also said the SPAC market would eventually rebound. 
""SPACs have already started to arrive in Europe, combinations have been announced and closed and there are many sponsors, companies and investors who recognise the merits of the instrument,"" he said.

163,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 12:44AM ET</span>",China Evergrande NEV Shares Plunge After it Pulls Plug on CNY Share Issuance,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China  Evergrande  New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd.’s shares plunged on Monday after it said on Saturday that it is abandoning a plan to issue CNY shares on Shanghai’s Science and Technology Innovation Board.
The electric vehicle unit of China Evergrande Group (HK:3333) also warned that it has an uncertain future unless it got a swift injection of cash.
China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle’s Hong Kong shares tumbled 10.31% to HK$2 ($0.26) by 12:39 AM ET (4:39 AM GMT), after plunging up to 26% and hitting HK$1.66 earlier in the session. China Evergrande shares were steady at HK$2.36.
The warning, issued after the market closed on Friday, was the latest sign that the property developer’s liquidity crisis is spreading to other business units.
However, concerns that a collapse at China Evergrande could drive a global economic contagion have ebbed for some investors.
“I think the markets have priced in that on the balance of probabilities, the shock and awe are over,” IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters.
“Markets are really just expecting from here on in, a company that is doomed to failure but one which won’t be allowed to result in major risks within the Chinese financial system, or that contagion won’t pervade global markets.”
China Evergrande missed a payment deadline on a dollar bond during the previous week and was granted a 30-day grace period. The company is due to make a $47.5 million bond interest payment on its 9.5% March 2024 dollar bond on Sep. 29.
It currently has liabilities of around $305 billion and is scrambling to raise funds to pay it off. Currently, a meltdown with significant economic impacts, a managed collapse, or a bailout by the Chinese government, the least likely option, are all possible."
164,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 26, 2021 10:09PM ET</span>",Evergrande’s EV Unit Plunges After Warning of Cash Shortage,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group’s electric-car unit plunged in Hong Kong trading after it warned of a “serious shortage of funds” and scrapped plans to list in Shanghai, adding to concerns it may never reach its goal of mass vehicle production. 
Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. fell as much as 26% in early trading, taking their decline this year to about 94%. The company has shed more than $84 billion in market cap from its peak in April, when it was valued at more than Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. 
In a statement late Friday, Evergrande NEV said it has suspended paying some of its operating expenses and some suppliers have suspended work. The statement confirmed an earlier report by Bloomberg News that the company had missed salary payments to some workers, and fallen behind on paying a number of suppliers for factory equipment.
The cashflow difficulties mean the carmaker that once had ambitions to take on Elon Musk’s Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. in the electric-vehicles industry will now likely miss its target to start mass deliveries next year. The turmoil is symptomatic of the crisis gripping the parent company -- the world’s most-indebted developer -- which has roiled global markets on concern it will default.  
In a further sign of the EV unit’s struggles, it said Saturday it won’t proceed with a planned issue of yuan-denominated shares on the Science and Technology Innovation Board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
At it’s peak, Evergrande NEV was one of the most valuable assets in Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan’s empire, and a potential source of funds to prop up the parent company. However, the firm said earlier this month that “no material progress” had been made to sell a stake in the EV unit, which is now trying to offload assets of its own.  
Friday’s statement said Evergrande NEV -- officially created when Evergrande Health changed its name in July 2020 -- is negotiating to sell some of its aged-care projects and overseas assets in order to “supplement working capital.” However, it’s uncertain whether any deal will be struck. 
Last month, Evergrande NEV reported a 4.8 billion yuan ($742 million) loss for the six months to June 30 and revenue of 6.92 billion yuan, the vast majority of that -- 6.89 billion yuan -- from the health and aged-care business.

Meanwhile, the developer’s electric-car unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, will not proceed with a proposed issue of CNY-denominated shares.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - China's drive for self-sufficiency in aerospace and its growing military prowess will be on display at the country's largest air show this week, in an event set against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and trade frictions with the West. 
The normally biennial Airshow China in the southern city of Zhuhai, delayed by a year due to COVID-19, will be a mostly domestic affair because of tight quarantine rules.
""The fact that Airshow China is happening at all, when the global air show calendar has been pretty disrupted, allows China to show it has returned to post-COVID normalcy,"" said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
Local aerospace and defence firms have ramped up their presence significantly. Major Western suppliers like Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) will send their China-based teams, and there will also be a virtual component for those unable to travel.
The country's efforts to improve homegrown aerospace technology will be in the spotlight at a time of a growing strategic rivalry with the West.
""As China faces increasing threats from the West, it needs to improve its military-industrial, aviation and aerospace capabilities,"" said Song Zhongping, a military commentator and former PLA instructor on missile technology. 
Trade frictions with the West are also accelerating China's desire to reduce its dependency on foreign-made commercial products.
Commercial Aircraft Corp of China's (COMAC) C919 narrowbody plane, due to be certified this year, is made up mostly of Western parts but the mix is expected to change over time as Chinese technology advances, with the engines a key target for eventual domestic replacement.
ARMS RACE
More than 100 aircraft have registered for display in the air or on the ground as China shows off its military might and its space ambitions, including a next-generation crewed rocket and heavy-lift launch vehicle. 
State media reported the J-16D electronic warfare version of the J-16 fighter jet will make its show debut.
The flying displays will feature some products China wants to export, including the AG600, the world's largest amphibious aircraft, designed for fire-fighting and sea-rescue roles.
The Wing Loong II, an armed drone similar to the American MQ-9 Reaper, has already been sold to customers including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan as China competes against Western rivals for more military exports.
A new series of drone products named Feihong, including an unmanned helicopter, loitering missiles and a new generation of stealth drones, will make their debut at the show.
""Beijing is intent on not just pushing locally made military aircraft and aerospace technologies, but also its ability to address almost any military requirement out there,"" said Kelvin Wong, a Singapore-based defence technology analyst at Janes.
The show comes as analysts warn Asia may be sliding into an accelerating arms race as countries react to China's military growth. 
The United States and its Asian allies have expressed growing alarm at Beijing's military buildup, pressure on Taiwan and deployments in the contested South China Sea.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has complained for a year or more of repeated flights by China's air force near the democratically governed island.
The United States, Britain and Australia this month established a security partnership that will involve helping Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>",Canada foreign minister says eyes wide open when it comes to normalizing China ties,"TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's ""eyes are wide open"" when it comes to normalizing its relationship with China, Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said on Sunday, two days after the release of a Huawei executive following almost three years of house arrest in Vancouver.
Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, flew back to China on Friday after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end a bank fraud case against her. That resulted in the scrapping of her extradition battle in a Canadian court.
Soon after Meng flew to China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities just days after Meng's arrest in Vancouver in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant - were released by Beijing.
Garneau told CBC News the government is now following a fourfold approach to China: ""coexist,"" ""compete,"" ""cooperate"" and ""challenge.""
He said Canada would compete with China on issues like trade and cooperate on climate change, while challenging it on its treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans and Hong Kong as Ottawa has done in the past.
""Let me say, our eyes are wide open. We have been saying that for some time. There was no path to a relationship with China as long as the two Michaels were being detained,"" Garneau said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Garneau received the two Canadians on Saturday when they arrived in Calgary, Alberta, after spending more than 1,000 days in solitary confinement.
Spavor was accused of supplying photographs of military equipment to Kovrig and sentenced in August to 11 years in jail. Kovrig had been awaiting sentencing.
Trudeau, who won a third term last Monday after a tight election race, had vowed to improve ties with China after becoming prime minister in 2015, building on his father's success in establishing diplomatic ties with China in 1970.
But even before Meng's arrest, Canada's repeated questioning of China's human rights positions had irked Beijing, and the two countries have failed to come closer.
China has always denied any link between Meng's extradition case and the detention of the two Canadians, but Garneau said that ""the immediate return of the two Michaels linked"" it to Meng's case in a ""very direct manner."" 
Garneau said he had heard about the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) several weeks ago, which opened the door to the return of the two men.
Canadian Ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman denied Washington had made the release of Kovrig and Spavor a condition for the resolution of the charges against Meng.
""Absolutely not. The DPA and the resolution of the charges against Ms. Meng was a completely independent process, and it was proceeding as it did,"" Hillman told Canadian broadcaster CTV.

Garneau also said he did not think the timing of the men's return had anything to do with that of the federal election.
""I think it just worked out that way.""

The agreement comes after weeks of second-round talks between the two parties after the first round of negotiations over proposed changes to workers' retirement benefits and unresolved grievances had failed to go through in July.
Unifor, which represents about 900 workers at the miner's aluminium smelting plant in Kitimat and power generating facility in Kemano, had started a strike action at BC Works in July after the failed first round of talks.

""Both parties are satisfied that the proposed agreement will provide a foundation for respect in the workplace and underpin a competitive and sustainable future for BC Works,"" Rio Tinto said in a statement on its website on Sunday.
Both parties, however, refrained from revealing the details of the agreement until Unifor presented the proposed deal to its members and sought a ratification vote, which is expected to be conducted in the coming days, Rio added.

People used umbrellas to protect themselves from falling volcanic cash, while the airport's departures hall was quiet and boards showed only cancelled flights. 
""They laugh at us because of the umbrella but if we don't use it we end up covered in ash,"" said engineer Waldo Nasco. 
Experts said on Sunday there were two active lava flows, one fast-moving flow to the north and a slower one to the south. 
""We have a flow to the north that is moving quickly... this lava comes from more interior areas of the crater and its temperature is about 1,250 degrees [Celsius],"" said Miguel Angel Morcuende, director of volcano response committee Pevolca, told a news conference on Sunday.
Reuters drone footage showed a rapid river of red hot lava flowing down the slopes of the crater, passing close to homes, and swathes of land and buildings engulfed by a black mass of slower-moving, older lava.
Lava destroyed the village church in Todoque on Sunday afternoon, its bell tower crumbling under the flow. It narrowly escaped earlier in the week when lava stopped just short of the church. 
Morcuende said people who had been evacuated from Tacande de Arriba, Tacande de Abajo and Tajuya would be able to return to their homes. 
Spain's airport operator Aena said the airport had reopened after teams cleared ash off the runway. But Binter, the Canary Island airline said it would not allow flights today because of the conditions.
""The ash cloud originating from the volcanic eruption makes it necessary to maintain the temporary stoppage of flights to La Palma... The flights scheduled for today have been cancelled,"" it said in a statement, adding flights would be halted until conditions allowed them to take place safely.
'CLOSENESS AND SOLIDARITY'
Pope Francis sent a message of ""closeness and solidarity"" to those affected by the eruption during his weekly blessing in St. Peter's Square.
On La Palma, churches held special masses for those affected. 
""There are many people who are having a very bad time so we are praying for them,"" said Magali Zarate, 49, from Mexico, after mass at the church of Colegio Sagrada Familia de Nazaret, where people outside swept away volcanic ash. 
Zarate was on holiday on La Palma and was unable to return home because her flight was cancelled. 
The Cumbre Vieja https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/iberia-binter-cancel-some-flights-la-palma-due-volcanic-ash-2021-09-24 volcano, which began erupting last Sunday, entered a new explosive phase on Friday, experts said. The national Geographical and Mining Institute said on Saturday its drones had shown the volcano's cone had broken.
The eruption has destroyed hundreds of houses and forced the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people since it began on Sept. 19.
""La Palma airport is back in operation. After progress in ash cleaning work, it can now be reopened,"" Aena tweeted. 
Travellers had been faced with cancelled flights on Saturday, and many had joined long queues at the port in the hope of getting a boat off the island.
On Sunday, ferry operator Fred Olsen Express said it would add an extra round trip between La Palma and Tenerife from Monday until Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) will give Europe more clout and set standards and rules for the 21st century, the EU's trade and digital chiefs said, underscoring global concerns about China's growing power.
The comments by Valdis Dombrovskis and Margrethe Vestager came ahead of the first TTC meeting in Pittsburgh on Wednesday and as the United States and Europe face off with China in areas ranging from trade to defence to technology and human rights.
""There is real strategic and geopolitical importance to this new platform as a way in setting standards and rules for the 21st century. So we need this Council to amplify our status,"" Dombrovskis told reporters.
Dombrovskis insisted, however, that the platform was not targeted at any particular country.
""TTC is not about any specific third country, it is about cooperation and coordination on a number of policy areas between the United States and the EU,"" he said. 
The Council's 10 working groups will focus on technology standards, green technology, supply-chain security, data governance, export controls, investment screening and global trade issues, among others.
All these areas are key for the EU, Vestager said.
""What we have achieved is a package that covers, I think, both offensive and defensive interests,"" she told reporters. 
Dombrovskis said French fury at Australia's decision to scrap a $40 billion submarine deal for one with the United States and Britain should not deflect the EU from its long-term interests.
""We are allies, partners and friends, and yes friends can easily from time to time make mistakes and we have seen this in recent weeks, but we knew this issue should not cloud our judgment on our strategic alliances,"" he said.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Trade Representative Katherine Tai will be the co-chairs of the meeting with Dombrovskis and Vestager.
The EU hopes to hold a second meeting next spring in Belgium.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Box Office: 'Dear Evan Hansen' Hits Wrong Notes as 'Shang-Chi' Stays No. 1,"By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" the Universal Pictures adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, didn't strike a chord with moviegoers. 
Marred by negative reviews and COVID-19 concerns, the film fell short of expectations and collected a muted $7.5 million from 3,365 North American theaters in its debut. Industry experts predicted the movie musical would make at least $10 million between Friday and Sunday. 
Even though the film seems unlikely to turn a profit in theaters, the losses won't be catastrophic. ""Dear Evan Hansen"" cost $28 million to produce, a modest budget for a musical. That puts Universal in a much better position compared to its last movie musical, ""Cats,"" which opened to $6.5 million in late 2019 and ultimately lost the studio nearly all of its $100 million budget. 
The critical response to ""Dear Evan Hansen"" has been vastly different than the glowing reactions that greeted the 2016 stage version, which netted six Tony Awards and cemented Ben Platt as a star. It underscores the struggle to bring even commercially popular musicals to the big screen. Platt reprised his role as Evan Hansen, an anxious high school student who finds himself tangled in a lie that spirals out of control. Many criticized the casting choice because Platt is 27 years old and doesn't look like a teenager. 

At least one positive: Audiences, at least the few who bought a ticket on opening weekend, appeared to like ""Dear Evan Hansen"" more than critics did. It landed an ""A-"" CinemaScore from moviegoers, which is exponentially better than its 33% on Rotten Tomatoes. Around 62% of patrons were female, while 53% were, like Platt, over the age of 25. 
Given the underwhelming turnout for ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" reigning box office champion ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" had no trouble staying atop domestic charts, even in its fourth weekend of release. The Disney and Marvel superhero adventure added a solid $13.3 million in ticket sales, bringing its domestic tally to $196.5 million, a pandemic record. 
After this weekend's haul, ""Shang-Chi"" surpassed its fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe installment ""Black Widow"" ($183 million) as the highest-grossing movie of the year. Unlike ""Shang-Chi,"" the Scarlett Johansson-led ""Black Widow"" wasn't available exclusively in theaters. The film premiered simultaneously on Disney Plus (for a premium $30 fee), where it has generated at least $125 million. Weeks ago, Johansson sued Disney and alleged the movie's hybrid release depressed box office ticket sales and cut into her compensation. "

175,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",UK warned visa plan to fix truck driver shortage will not solve crunch,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s decision to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers is a short-term fix that will not solve an acute labour shortage that risks major disruption for retailers in the run-up to Christmas, business leaders have warned.
Long lines of vehicles formed at petrol stations for a second day on Saturday as motorists waited in line, some for hours, to fill up with fuel after oil firms reported a lack of drivers was causing transport problems from refineries to forecourts, leading some operators to ration supplies and others to close gas stations. 
The fuel supply issues come on the back of warnings from the retail industry that unless the driver shortage was sorted out there would be major problems ahead of the busy festive shopping period. 
""After a very difficult 18 months, I know how important this Christmas is for all of us and that's why we're taking these steps at the earliest opportunity to ensure preparations remain on track,"" transport minister Grant Shapps said in a statement.
The UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says Britain is facing a shortage of some 100,000 drivers, a result of workers leaving the industry, Brexit and the pandemic, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year.
Under the government's plans, 5,000 heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers would be able to come to Britain under temporary visas, while another 5,500 visas would be issued to poultry workers ""to avoid any potential further pressures on the food industry"".
These short-term visas, which the government had previously rejected introducing despite calls from retail and logistics companies, will expire on Dec. 24.
Additionally, up to 4,000 people will be trained as new truck drivers, letters will be sent out to nearly a million drivers with HGV licences to entice them back to the industry, and ministry of defence examiners will be drafted in to speed up the testing process.
The government said the visas were not a long-term solution and the long-term solution was to hire more British drivers with better pay and conditions.
""We are acting now but the industries must also play their part with working conditions continuing to improve and the deserved salary increases continuing to be maintained in order for companies to retain new drivers,"" Shapps said. 
Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, who warned on Friday the government had just 10 days to solve the driver shortage issue, said the plans were insufficient.
""The limit of 5,000 visas will do little to alleviate the current shortfall,"" he said. ""Supermarkets alone have estimated they need at least 15,000 HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas and avoid disruption or availability issues.""

Others have cautioned European drivers may not want to work in Britain again anyway.
""I expect many drivers will not return to the UK even if the UK government allows them to,"" said Marco Digioia, general secretary of the European Road Haulers Association, told the i newspaper.

Common prosperity - China's term for narrowing the gap between rich and poor - is ""not just a number"", Zhang said, stressing the importance of helping local talent in poor regions to ""teach a man to fish"".
The World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in eastern China is organised by the Cyberspace Administration of China. The conference in the past has drawn such foreign executives as Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, but overseas attendance was hurt this year by COVID-19 protocols and souring U.S.-China relations.

China's regulatory crackdown has hit sectors from cryptocurrencies and the internet, to entertainment, education and property, wiping hundreds of billions off the market value some of its largest companies and putting investors on alert over who may be next.
The listing of Alibaba's financial affiliate was halted and the e-commerce giant was fined a record $2.75 for anti-competitive behaviour.
Policymakers and executives at the conference did not address the crackdown directly, though Liu He, China's vice premier, said the digital economy can at times stifle competition. Common prosperity has re-emerged as a slogan this year after President Xi Jinping used it in public remarks.

Reeling under $305 billion of debt, Evergrande missed a payment deadline on a dollar bond last week, and its silence on the matter has set global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when a 30-day grace period ends.
The special accounts have been set up since late August in at least eight provinces where Evergrande has the most unfinished projects, the Chinese outlet said on Sunday, citing a source close to the developer's management team.
These include Anhui, Guizhou, Henan, Jiangsu and cities in the southern Pearl River Delta, it added.
The custodian accounts aim to ensure homebuyers' payments are used to complete Evergrande's housing projects, and not diverted elsewhere, such as to creditors, Caixin said. 
In some southern cities, such as Zhuhai and Shenzhen, the offices of the housing regulator, the Ministry of Housing and Urban‑Rural Development, were also involved in overseeing and reviewing fund use by Evergrande's projects, it said.
Evergrande and the housing ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In recent months, the cash-strapped developer, which epitomises the borrow-to-build business model, has stopped repaying some investors and suppliers and halted building work at many projects across China.
The housing regulator has also set a Sept. 24 deadline for regional offices to report on the funding gaps facing Evergrande's unfinished projects, Caixin said, but it was not immediately clear if this had been met.

By the end of June, Evergrande still had 1,236 projects for sale, it said in a semi-annual report, including those completed and under construction.
Last week, the Wall Street Journal newspaper said Chinese authorities had asked local governments to prepare for a possible collapse of Evergrande, urging them to prevent unrest and mitigate ripple effects on the rest of the economy.

LA PALMA (Reuters) - Volcanic explosions spewed red hot lava high into the air on La Palma on Saturday as a new emission vent opened, forcing the small Spanish island to close its airport and causing long queues for boats off the island. 
The Cumbre Vieja https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/iberia-binter-cancel-some-flights-la-palma-due-volcanic-ash-2021-09-24 volcano, which began erupting last Sunday, is entering a new explosive phase. The Canary Islands Volcanology Institute, Involcan, said the new emission vent that had opened was to the west of the principle vent. 
The national Geographical and Mining Institute said its drones had shown the volcano's cone had broken.
""It is not unusual in this type of eruption that the cone of the volcano fractures. A crater is formed that does not support its own weight and ... the cone breaks,"" Miguel Angel Morcuende, director of volcano response committee Pevolca, told a news conference on Saturday. ""This partial rupture happened overnight.""
Morcuende said the evacuations currently in place would be maintained for another 24 hours as a precaution. 
The volcano has spewed out thousands of tons of lava, destroyed hundreds of houses and forced the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people since it began erupting last Sunday. La Palma, with a population of over 83,000, is one of an archipelago making up the Canary Islands in the Atlantic.
Spanish airport operator Aena said the island's airport had closed. 
""La Palma airport is inoperative due to ash accumulation. Cleaning tasks have started, but the situation may change at any time,"" it tweeted. 
Workers swept volcanic ash off the runway, electronic boards showed cancelled flights and the departures hall was quiet as some people arriving at the airport discovered they would not be able to fly out.

SHENZHEN, China/TORONTO (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou arrived in China on Saturday, ending her near three-year U.S. extradition fight, the same day two Canadians detained by Beijing for more than 1,000 days returned home, potentially paving the way for improved ties between China and the two western allies.
Meng https://www.reuters.com/business/huawei-heir-apparent-prepares-life-after-three-years-canada-court-battle-2021-09-24, the daughter of Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei, was allowed to go home after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors on Friday to end a bank fraud case against her. 
The extradition drama has been a central source of discord between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signalling that the case had to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate. 
Two Canadians detained by Chinese authorities just days after Meng's arrest - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - were embraced on the tarmac by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after they landed in Calgary. 
""You've shown incredible strength, resilience, and perseverance,"" Trudeau said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post with photos of him welcoming them home. ""Know that Canadians across the country will continue to be here for you, just as they have been.""
In the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, Meng wore a patriotic red-coloured dress as she exited a plane to be greeted by well-wishers. 
""I'm finally back home,"" Meng was quoted as saying by the Global Times tabloid backed by the ruling Communist Party. ""The waiting in a foreign country was full of suffering. I was speechless the moment my feet touched Chinese soil."" 
Chinese state media welcomed Meng back but were silent about Kovrig and Spavor, who were released hours after Meng on Friday.
Huawei said in a statement that it ""looked forward to seeing Ms. Meng returning home safely to be reunited with her family."" It said it would continue to defend itself against U.S. charges.
The agreement opened U.S. President Joe Biden to criticism from Washington's China hawks who argue his administration is capitulating to China and one of its top companies at the centre of a global technology rivalry between the two countries.
Some Republican senators swiftly condemned Meng's release and urged the White House to address the U.S. Congress on the issue.
""The release of Ms. Meng raises serious questions about President Biden's ability and willingness to confront the threat posed by Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Marco Rubio in a text message to Reuters.
Senator Jim Risch said in a statement that the deal was ""a victory for one of the world's most brutal and cruel regimes,"" and would embolden the Communist Party ""to use other foreign citizens as bargaining chips because it now knows hostage taking is a successful way to get what it wants."" 
Some Chinese commentators felt otherwise.
""By agreeing to let Meng return to China, the Biden administration is signalling that it hopes to clear the mess left behind by the former Trump administration,"" said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University.
'BLURRING WITH TEARS' 
Chinese state broadcaster CCTV carried a statement by Meng, written as her plane flew over the North Pole, avoiding U.S. airspace. Meng said her eyes were ""blurring with tears"" as she approached ""the embrace of the great motherland.""
Meng was detained in December 2018 in Vancouver after a New York court issued an arrest warrant, saying she tried to cover up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions. 
Acting U.S. attorney Nicole Boeckmann said Meng had ""taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetuating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution.""
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the charges against her had been ""fabricated"" in order to suppress the country's high-tech industries. 
At the airport in Shenzhen, Meng's hometown, a crowd of well-wishers chanted patriotic slogans and held aloft red banners to welcome her return.
""The fact that Meng Wanzhou can be declared not guilty and released is a huge victory in politics and diplomacy for people in China,"" said Liu Dan, who was among the crowd. 
State news agency Xinhua attributed Meng's release to the ""unremitting efforts of the Chinese government"". 
Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the Global Times, wrote on Twitter that ""international relations have fallen into chaos"" as a result of Meng's ""painful three years"".
He added, ""No arbitrary detention of Chinese people is allowed."" 
However, neither Hu nor other local media have mentioned the release of Spavor and Kovrig, and reactions on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform have been few and far between.
China's foreign ministry has not commented publicly.

China has previously denied engaging in ""hostage diplomacy"", insisting that the arrest and detention of the Canadians was not tied in any way to the proceedings against Meng. 
Spavor was accused of supplying photographs of military equipment to Kovrig and sentenced to 11 years in jail in August. Kovrig had still been awaiting sentencing.

The company, placed in bankruptcy administration in February, said in a statement on its official WeChat account it had been notified by police in its home province of Hainan, southern China, that Chairman Chen Feng and CEO Tan Xiangdong had been taken.
""The operations of HNA Group and its member companies are stable and orderly, and the bankruptcy and restructuring work is progressing smoothly according to the law,"" the company said. 
A separate HNA statement on Friday said the company's Communist Party members were informed in a meeting that police had taken away Chen and Tan. Attendees were urged to strengthen the party's leadership in HNA.
In the 2010s HNA Group, whose flagship business is carrier Hainan Airlines, used a $50 billion global acquisition spree, mainly fuelled by debt, to build an empire with stakes in businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide. 
But its spending drew scrutiny from the Chinese government and overseas regulators. As concerns grew over its mounting debts, it sold assets such as airport services company Swissport and electronics distributors Ingram Micro to focus on its airline and tourism businesses.
In early 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic paralysed travel demand, the Hainan government sent in a work group to HNA to help resolve its liquidity problems. 
Last week HNA said it would be reorganised into four independently operated sections, including ones for aviation and financial, and that all equity held by its old shareholders would be wiped out after the reorganisation. 
Chen, 68, became HNA's sole chairman in 2018 when his co-founder and then co-chairman Wang Jian died in France https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hna-chairman-idUSKBN1JU0SQ in what local police said appeared to be an accidental fall from a wall while posing for a photograph.
54-year-old Tan Xiangdong, also known as Adam Tan, became HNA Group's CEO in 2016. He stepped down as chairman of Dublin-based aircraft leasing giant Avolon, in which HNA affiliate Bohai Leasing owns a majority stake, in February this year.
A filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) Inc., dated March 15, 2017, indicates that Tan is a U.S. citizen. 
Hainan Airlines said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange earlier on Friday that trading in its shares would be halted on Monday, as participants in its restructuring meet for discussions, and would resume on Tuesday. 

The stock is up 48% year-to-date.
Chinese stocks have been rattled in recent weeks by concerns over the financial health of property developer China Evergrande Group, a collapse of which could send shockwaves through China's economy and beyond.

Let’s also remember that the average bull market lasts for over five years and the current one is only 18 months into its journey. So there is still plenty of time on the clock.
Unfortunately one should not fool themselves into thinking that the north of 100% gain since the beginning will be the pace of gains going forward. As we have seen the last several months gains have slowed down considerably along with an serious spike in volatility.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>","Huawei CFO leaves Canada after U.S. agreement on fraud charges, detained Canadians head home","By Karen Freifeld, Kenneth Li, Moira Warburton and David Ljunggren
(Reuters) -Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou flew home to China on Friday after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, relieving a point of tension between China and the United States.
Within hours of the news of the deal, two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody in December 2018 were released from Chinese jails and were on their way back to Canada. Beijing had denied that their arrests were linked. 
The years-long extradition drama has been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signaling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate.
The deal also opens U.S. President Joe Biden to criticism from China hawks in Washington who argue his administration is capitulating to China and one of its top companies at the center of a global technology rivalry between the two countries. 
Meng was arrested https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei/top-huawei-executive-arrested-on-u-s-request-clouding-china-trade-truce-idUSKBN1O42S1 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant, and indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran. 
In an exclusive https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-brooklyn-federal-court-2021-09-24 on Friday, Reuters reported that the United States had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Meng.
Nicole Boeckmann, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said that in entering into the agreement, ""Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution.""
The agreement pertains only to Meng, and the U.S. Justice Department said it is preparing for trial against Huawei and looks forward to proving its case in court. 
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the release of Meng or the Canadians.
A spokeswoman for Huawei declined to comment.
A person familiar with the matter said Meng - the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei https://www.reuters.com/business/huawei-heir-apparent-prepares-life-after-three-years-canada-court-battle-2021-09-24 - had left Canada on a flight to Shenzhen.
The two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, had been held in China for more than 1,000 days. In August, a Chinese court sentenced https://www.reuters.com/article/china-canada-spavor-idCNL1N2PI07Y Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage.
The International Crisis Group, where Kovrig works, said it was ""overjoyed"" at the ""most just decision"" to release him, thanking Canada and the United States for their roles. ""The day we have been waiting for 1,020 days has finally arrived,"" the advocacy group said in a statement.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in brief remarks late on Friday the two men had left Chinese airspace just minutes before. He was not asked whether the two countries had struck a bilateral deal.
""I want to thank our allies and partners around the world in the international community who have stood steadfast in solidarity with Canada and with these two Canadians,"" he said.
At a hearing in Brooklyn federal court on Friday, which Meng attended virtually from Canada, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler said the government would move to dismiss the charges against her if she complies with all of her obligations under the agreement, which ends in December 2022. He added that Meng will be released on a personal recognizance bond, and that the United States plans to withdraw its request to Canada for her extradition. 
Meng pleaded not guilty to the charges in the hearing. When U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly later accepted the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng sighed audibly. 
A Canadian judge later signed Meng's order of discharge, vacating her bail conditions and allowing her to go free after nearly three years of house arrest.
She was emotional after the judge's order, hugging and thanking her lawyers. 
Speaking to supporters and reporters on the steps of the court afterward, Meng thanked the judge for her ""fairness"" and talked of how the case had turned her life ""upside down"". 
Meng was confined to her expensive Vancouver home at night and monitored 24/7 by private security that she paid for as part of her bail agreement. Referred to by Chinese state media as the ""Princess of Huawei,"" she was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements, which became fodder for the tabloids when it hung above her designer shoes.
'HUAWEI CONFIDENTIAL' 
Articles published by Reuters in 2012 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230 and 2013 https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131 about Huawei, Hong Kong-registered company Skycom and Meng figured prominently in the U.S. criminal case against her. Reuters reported that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010.
Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. The stories prompted HSBC to question Meng about Reuters findings.
Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 that restricts sales to the company for activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The restrictions have hobbled the company, which suffered its biggest revenue drop in the first half of 2021, after the U.S. supply restrictions drove it to sell a chunk of its once-dominant handset business before new growth areas have matured.
The criminal case against Meng and Huawei is cited in the blacklisting. Huawei is charged with operating as a criminal enterprise, stealing trade secrets and defrauding financial institutions. It has pleaded not guilty. 
A Canadian government official said Ottawa would not comment until the U.S. court proceedings were over. 
CHINA VS USA
Huawei has become a dirty word in Washington, with China hawks in Congress quick to react to any news that could be construed as the United States being soft, despite Huawei's struggles under the trade restrictions. 
Then-President Donald Trump politicized the case when he told Reuters soon after Meng's arrest that he would intervene if it would serve national security or help secure a trade deal. Meng's lawyers have said she was a pawn in the political battle between the two super powers.
Republican China hardliners in Congress called Friday's deal a ""capitulation.""
""Instead of standing firm against China's hostage-taking and blackmail, President Biden folded,"" Republican Senator Tom Cotton said in a statement.
Senior U.S. officials have said that Meng's case was being handled solely by the Justice Department and the case had no bearing on the U.S. approach to strained ties with China. 

During U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman's July trip to China, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng insisted that the United States drop its extradition case against Meng. 
U.S. officials have acknowledged that Beijing had linked Meng's case to the case of the two detained Canadians, but insisted that Washington would not be drawn into viewing them as bargaining chips.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) late on Friday raised Hungary's sovereign credit rating to 'Baa2' from 'Baa3' on the economy's strong rebound from the pandemic, which comes as a boon to Prime Minister Viktor Orban amid a campaign for early 2022 elections.
Orban, the country's longest-serving leader since Communist times, faces what could be Hungary's first tight election in more than a decade. 
Ramping up his campaign, Orban has showered the electorate with handouts, including a $2 billion income tax rebate for families, waiving income tax for young workers, home renovation grants and extra pension payments. 
The nationalist leader has also stepped up his anti-immigration campaign following the Taliban takeover of power in Afghanistan and has grown increasingly radical on social policy to protect what he says are traditional Christian values from Western liberalism.
Orban says the strong recovery allows the extra spending, despite calls from the central bank to rein in Hungary's budget deficit faster.
Moody's said the projected strong growth rebound and medium-term outlook over the coming years will ""support fiscal consolidation and reduction in the government's debt burden"".
""Overall, Moody's expects only very limited scarring from the coronavirus pandemic,"" the agency said in its statement.
Hungary's economic growth could reach 7% to 7.5% this year, Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said on Friday.
The recovery has accelerated since the second quarter, helped by fiscal and monetary stimulus which has boosted loans to companies and households.
Moody's said Hungary's medium-term outlook until 2025 was supported by high investment rates.
The central bank expects a ""positive credit rating path"" ahead for the economy after the upgrade, it said on Saturday.
An August survey by think tank Zavecz Research put support for Orban's Fidesz party at 37% of all voters, while combined support for the six opposition parties stood at 39%.

The six-party Hungarian opposition alliance is currently running a first round of primary elections to pick Orban's challenger. 
They have criticised the government for alleged corruption, surging prices and a widening wealth gap.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 09:10PM ET</span>","Google CEO sought to keep Incognito mode issues out of spotlight, lawsuit alleges","By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai in 2019 was warned that describing the company's Incognito browsing mode as ""private"" was problematic, yet it stayed the course because he did not want the feature ""under the spotlight,"" according to a new court filing.
Google spokesman José Castañeda told Reuters that the filing ""mischaracterizes emails referencing unrelated second and third-hand accounts.""
The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit's privacy disclosures have generated regulatory and legal scrutiny in recent years amid growing public concerns about online surveillance. 
Users last June alleged in a lawsuit that Google unlawfully tracked their internet use when they were browsing Incognito in its Chrome browser. Google has said it makes clear that Incognito only stops data from being saved to a user's device and is fighting the lawsuit.
In a written update on trial preparations filed Thursday in U.S. district court, attorneys for the users said they ""anticipate seeking to depose"" Pichai and Google Chief Marketing Officer Lorraine Twohill. 
The attorneys, citing Google documents, said Pichai ""was informed in 2019 as part of a project driven by Twohill that Incognito should not be referred to as 'private' because that ran 'the risk of exacerbating known misconceptions about protections Incognito mode provides.'"" 
The filing continued, ""As part of those discussions, Pichai decided that he 'didn't want to put incognito under the spotlight' and Google continued without addressing those known issues.""
Castañeda said teams ""routinely discuss ways to improve the privacy controls built into our services."" Google's attorneys said they would oppose efforts to depose Pichai and Twohill.

Last month, plaintiffs deposed Google vice president Brian Rakowski, described in the filing as ""the 'father' of Incognito mode."" He testified that though Google states Incognito enables browsing ""privately,"" what users expect ""may not match"" up with the reality, according to the plaintiffs' write-up.
Google's attorneys rejected the summary, writing that Rakowski also said terms including ""private,"" ""anonymous,"" and ""invisible"" with proper context ""can be super helpful"" in explaining Incognito.

The sources could not be named as the information had not yet been made public.
Prudential did not immediately reply to a request for comment outside of business hours.
Prudential sold 130.8 million shares, or 5% of its issued share capital in the deal, which was the first follow-on share placement to be open to Hong Kong retail investors.
The price guidance given to investors represented a 3% discount to the stock's closing price in London on Friday.
Prudential, the diversified insurance group, said it planned to use most of the funds raised to pay down high-coupon debt within six months.

It said it would use the remaining funds to add to its cash balance.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - After being stuck in Canada for nearly three years, largely confined to her multi-million-dollar house in Vancouver, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Friday was set to return home to China https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-court-expected-reach-agreement-with-us-source-2021-09-24.
Like many top Chinese executives, Meng has remained an enigmatic figure. The 49-year-old CFO of Huawei Technologies had been widely tipped to one day take the helm of the tech giant her father founded.
Seeming to thwart those expectations, Meng was detained in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant charging her with bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
After Meng reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to resolve the case on Friday, a Canadian judge scrapped her extradition hearing.
Later, the Canadian government released a statement confirming that she was free to leave the country. She was due to fly to China later on Friday, according to a source familiar with the matter.
""Over the past three years my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, as a wife,"" Meng told reporters and supporters on the steps outside the Vancouver courtroom after the hearing.
""But I believe every cloud has a silver lining. It really was an invaluable experience in my life. I will never forget all the good wishes I received from people around the world,"" she said.
Meng has usually remained expressionless in public appearances since her arrest, but on Friday morning she smiled broadly as she left her home to attend a court hearing conducted virtually between Vancouver and Brooklyn, New York.
The detention of Meng, who takes her family name from her mother and has also used the English first names ""Cathy"" and ""Sabrina,"" threw the spotlight on Huawei at a time of heightened global concerns over tech security.
In dozens of court appearances, her lawyers portrayed her as an innocent bystander caught up in a trade war between the United States and China. 
Shortly after her arrest, China detained two Canadians, sentencing one this month to 11 years in prison, in a move Canadians assailed as retaliation. Beijing has denied any connection between the arrests and Meng's case. 
Meng was under loose house arrest in Vancouver. Under her bail terms, she was been permitted to roam the city during the day and return at night to her house in Shaughnessy, an upscale neighborhood in the Pacific coastal city. She was monitored 24/7 by private security, which she paid for as part of her bail deal.
Her husband, Liu Xiaozong, and the son and daughter they have together have been able to visit her during the pandemic. She passed the time with oil painting, reading and work, according to an open letter to Huawei employees she wrote on the first anniversary of her arrest. 
According to Huawei's website, Meng joined the company in 1993, obtained a master's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1998, and rose through the ranks over the years, mostly in financial roles.
She has held the positions of director of the international accounting department, CFO of Huawei Hong Kong, and president of the accounting management department, according to the website.
In her first media appearance before the Chinese press in 2013, Meng said she had first joined the company as a secretary ""whose job was just to take calls.""
In 2011 she was first named as a board member. Company insiders describe her as capable and hardworking.
While her brother, Meng Ping, as well as her father's younger brother and his current wife all work at Huawei and related companies, none has held such senior management roles.
Meng is widely seen by Huawei insiders as the likely successor to company founder Ren Zhengfei. Ren, 76, founded the Chinese telecommunications company in 1988 and has largely kept a low profile.
Much of the scrutiny of Huawei stems from Ren's background with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), where he worked as a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983, after helping to build its communications network.
Officials in some governments, particularly the United States, have voiced concern that his company is close to the Chinese military and government. Huawei has repeatedly insisted Beijing has no influence over it.
At the time of Meng's arrest, Huawei's revenue was split equally between domestic and international revenue, half of which came from supplying equipment to telecoms carriers around the world.
But since then Western countries have distanced themselves from the Chinese tech giant. In 2019 Huawei was put on an export blacklist by then-U.S. President Donald Trump and barred from accessing critical technology of U.S. origin, affecting its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors.

The ban put Huawei's handset business under immense pressure, with the company selling off its budget smartphone unit to a consortium of agents and dealers in November 2020 to keep it alive.
The company's consumer sales now make up over half of its business, with 66% of revenue coming from China, according to its 2020 annual report.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Houston-based oil producer Hilcorp is evaluating Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX)'s refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, for conversion into an oil export terminal, said four sources familiar with the matter, a move that would eliminate it as a source of motor fuels. 
Hilcorp, the largest privately owned U.S. oil producer, with operations from Alaska to Pennsylvania to Texas, did not reply to questions about its interest in the facility, which occupies 2,400 acres along the Mississippi River. 
The sources said a buyer was scheduled to visit the refinery this week. 
Phillips 66 declined to comment on a buyer's possible visit to the refinery this week. 
The hurricane-damaged refinery remains for sale and its ""marketing process is ongoing,” said Phillips 66 spokesperson Bernardo Fallas. The company plans to repair the storm damages and restart the facility, he said.
In August, Phillips 66 began meeting with potential buyers of the 255,600 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Louisiana, on the state's southeast coast. It was knocked out of commission by Hurricane Ida last month when a protective wall gave way, flooding the plant.
“The U.S. refining business in the future is going to be smaller, not bigger,” Phillips 66 Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said last month as he laid out plans to advance businesses in renewable diesel, hydrogen and materials for electric-car batteries. 
Most of the several feet of water that flooded the plant has been removed and most employees have returned to clean-up of the plant, said people familiar with its operations. 
In June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said national refining capacity last year fell by 4.5%, or 848,385 bpd, because of weak refining profits with work-from-home policies slashing gasoline demand. 
A conversion of the Alliance site into a crude oil storage and distribution terminal makes sense, said Andrew Lipow, president of Houston consultants Lipow Oil Associates. 
“These refineries are getting older and older especially in a climate where we have seen gasoline demand has peaked,” Lipow said. 
The Alliance refinery is one of three along the Gulf Coast that has been offered for sale this year.
The other two are LyondellBasell Industries’ 263,776-bpd Houston refinery and Royal Dutch Shell’s shuttered 211,146-bpd Convent, Louisiana, refinery. 
The Alliance refinery could still have a future in the current energy transition, said John Auers, executive vice president with refinery-consultants Turner, Mason & Company
“It’s still a viable refinery,” Auers said. “We’ve had a lot of capacity turned off. It could potentially come back pretty strong.” 

Phillips 66 does have an incentive to make repairs, Auers said.
“You always get more money (for a refinery) if it’s in an operable condition,” Auers said.

(Reuters) - Two-time Olympian gymnast and sexual abuse survivor Aly Raisman is sharing her story of resilience and healing in a new television special, ""Aly Raisman: Darkness to Light.""
    In the three-hour, two-part special Raisman recounts her journey to recovery and speaks with various survivors and experts on sexual abuse, including #MeToo founder Tarana Burke.
    While she said she found the process of producing the special healing and rewarding, Raisman recalled being physically drained.
    ""I would be like laying on the couch or just in between interviewing survivors, and I just felt so sick and so tired,"" she told Reuters. ""I'm trying to navigate how I can prevent from feeling like that, but also recognizing if I do feel like that, it's OK to feel like that.""
   Raisman, who won six medals in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, recognizes the pitfalls of her current passion.
    ""It has truly affected my personal life of speaking up about this,"" she said.
    On Sept. 15, Raisman, along with fellow gymnasts Simone Biles, McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols, told a U.S. Senate panel how FBI failures allowed USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to continue sexually assaulting other girls and young women for more than a year.
Nassar was eventually tried and sentenced in January 2018 to up to 175 years in prison for abusing young female gymnasts who were entrusted to his care.
    Raisman, 27, expressed frustration that more has not been done to investigate USA Gymnastics or the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) for covering up Nassar's abuse for years. She wants a thorough independent probe to hold the sports bodies and FBI accountable.
    ""It's scary to think about how many people knew that he was an abuser and didn't do anything. And that's what's really important for people to understand, is that it really took a village to protect a pedophile,"" she said.
""Without the answers, we can't believe in a safer future and we don't know if there are still people working there or working with other children that covered up our abuse,"" Raisman added.
    The USOPC issued a statement saying it has implemented reforms after hiring a law firm to conduct an independent investigation.
    Six years after first speaking out, Raisman said she is learning to love gymnastics again.
    ""I basically lived in the gym,"" she said. ""There were some days I would train up to six to seven hours. I was so exhausted and just put everything I had"" (into it).

""And so, I also think that some of the people in the sport who really let us down, it was really hard for me to ... separate that from my love from gymnastics.""
    ""Aly Raisman: Darkness to Light"" will air on the U.S. cable network Lifetime on Sept. 24. Lifetime is a unit of A+E Networks, a 50–50 joint venture between Hearst Communications and The Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday ruled that a Cincinnati, Ohio-area healthcare provider could require its employees get vaccinated against COVID-19 or risk losing their job, in what appears to be the first ruling of its kind for a private employer in the United States.
The employees of St. Elizabeth Healthcare failed to establish that their individual liberties were being violated by the vaccine requirement of the hospital operator, which has the right to set employment terms, said U.S. District Judge David Bunning in Covington, Kentucky.
St. Elizabeth employees must get vaccinated by Oct. 1. The widespread availability of vaccines in the United States helped to reduce infections in the spring and early summer but the Delta variant has led to a new spike in cases and hospitalizations. https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/index.html
Alan Statman, who represented the employees, said they were evaluating their next steps.
Bunning's ruling is the first involving a request for an injunction against a private employer's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, said Mark Guilfoyle, a lawyer who represented St. Elizabeth.
In recent weeks, numerous large employers have begun to impose deadlines for employees to get vaccinated as COVID-19 infections remain elevated in the United States.
Also on Friday, the Biden Administration spelled out plans to require federal contractors to get vaccinated, which will apply to tens of millions of Americans.
Employer vaccine requirements have spawned numerous lawsuits, although most are still in the initial stages. A federal judge in June dismissed a lawsuit against Houston Methodist Hospital under Texas wrongful termination law.
The class action on behalf of St. Elizabeth employees was based in part on concerns about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, among other claims.

Those suspicions cannot override the law, said Bunning.
""If an employee believes his or her individual liberties are more important than legally permissible conditions on his or her employment, that employee can and should choose to exercise another individual liberty, no less significant – the right to seek other employment,"" wrote Bunning.

The new compliance date was due to come into effect on Tuesday.
The agency's no action letter, which affects quotes published by broker dealers for buying and selling of government bonds, does not change or amend the compliance date for a new rule aimed at stamping out fraud in U.S. equities markets starting on Sept. 28, 2021, the agency said.
The position ""concerns enforcement action only and does not represent a legal conclusion with respect to the applicability of statutory or regulatory provisions of the securities laws,"" the agency said.
Next week's new measure aims U.S. 'pink sheets' in shakeup as securities regulator looks to stamp out fraud to boost investor disclosures by requiring off-exchange issuers to make accurate, up-to-date financial information publicly available. These are frequently penny-stock companies that do not meet the main exchanges' listing standards.
The requirements have sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline.
The Financial Times reported this week that the new regulation may stave off broker dealers from trading in this space and taking on risks for fear of attracting an SEC enforcement action.

Bond trade associations, including the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, wrote to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply, the FT reported.
The SEC's Friday letter is a response to such cries by industry. While compliance is still mandatory by the Tuesday deadline, the top markets watchdog said its delay of enforcement actions is meant to allow for the necessary industry ""operational and systems changes"" that may lead to compliance with the rule.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky on Friday said she recommended booster shots for at-risk adult workers to protect essential workers and minority communities despite the agency's advisory committee voting against the measure.
The U.S. government is rolling out boosters starting with third doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and those in high-risk working and institutional settings, after health regulators cleared the move this week and Walensky signed off https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-65-older-high-risk-2021-09-23 on it earlier on Friday.
""Many of our frontline workers, essential workers, and those in congregate settings, come from communities that have already been hardest hit,"" Walensky told reporters. ""It was a decision about providing rather than withholding access.""
Walensky's decision broke from a recommendation on Thursday by a group of expert outside advisors who felt that a narrower group of people should initially receive the extra shot. She is not obliged to follow the advice of the panel.
""This was a scientific close call. In that situation, it was my call to make,"" she said at a White House briefing.

Walensky said the CDC would update its guidance on boosters as needed and expects to evaluate in the coming weeks data on boosters for recipients of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) COVID-19 vaccines.
White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients, who was also at the briefing said: ""We are ready and we are prepared and implementation is happening as we speak. So there are people who will be getting booster shots as early as this afternoon.""

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors on Friday to end the bank fraud case against her, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kessler told a New York judge.
The move should allow Meng to eventually leave Canada and relieve a point of tension between China and the United States.
Here is a timeline of Meng's extradition case.
AUG. 22, 2018: A New York court issues an arrest warrant for Meng to stand trial in the United States. 
DEC. 1, 2018: Meng is arrested by Canadian police in Vancouver as she changes planes. The arrest is not made public until Dec. 5. The Chinese embassy in Canada demands her release.
DEC. 6, 2018: Chinese officials say they have not been given a reason for Meng's arrest. The White House and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both move to distance themselves from the case. 
DEC. 7, 2018: Court proceedings show that the United States issued the arrest warrant because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country.
DEC. 8, 2018: China threatens Canada with consequences if it does not release Meng. 
DEC. 10, 2018: Two Canadians Michael Kovrig and Spavor are arrested in China. 
DEC. 11, 2018: Meng is released on bail to house arrest in Vancouver by a British Columbia court. U.S. President Donald Trump tells Reuters he will intervene in the case if it would serve national interests. 
JAN. 8, 2019: Documents found by Reuters confirm Huawei's links to companies suspected of operating in Iran and Syria, breaking sanctions. 
JAN. 22, 2019: The U.S. Justice Department announces it will formally seek the extradition of Meng to the United States.
JAN. 26, 2019: Trudeau fires John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China, after he tells Chinese-language media Huawei can make a good case against extradition, thanks in part to Trump's comments about his willingness to get involved.
MARCH 1, 2019: Canada approves the extradition order of Meng to the United States.
MARCH 3, 2019: Huawei sues the Canadian government over Meng's arrest.
MARCH 6, 2019: China says it found ""hazardous pests"" in Canadian canola samples and blocks most shipments of the crop.
JUNE 25, 2019: China blocks all pork shipments from Canada.
JULY 15, 2019: Canada postpones decision on whether to allow Huawei to build a 5G network in Canada.
MAY 27, 2020: A British Columbia Supreme Court judge rules the charges against Meng met the legal standard of double criminality, meaning they could be considered crimes in both the United States and Canada.
JUNE 19, 2020: China charges two detained Canadians with suspected espionage. 
SEPT. 28, 2020: Hearings begin on whether to allow Meng to add a new allegation of abuse of process to the case. 
AUG. 4, 2021: Meng returns to the courtroom for the final weeks of her hearings. 
AUG. 10, 2021: A Chinese court sentences Canadian businessman Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage.

AUG. 10, 2021 - Meng's extradition hearing wraps up and Canadian judge sets Oct. 21 to announce a date to issue a ruling in her case.
SEPT 24, 2021 - Meng has reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, U.S. prosecutors say, a move that should allow her to leave Canada. A hearing in her extradition case is set to take place in British Columbia Supreme Court later in the day.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian judge on Friday signed Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's order of discharge, vacating her bail conditions and allowing her to go free after nearly three years of house arrest as her U.S. extradition case ends.
Canadian government lawyers asked the court to withdraw the authority to proceed in her case and discharge her, after Meng reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors earlier on Friday that ended their bank fraud case against her.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 05:32PM ET</span>",Explainer-What is the role of outside advisers to the U.S. FDA and CDC in vaccine decisions?,"By Michael Erman
(Reuters) - The U.S. CDC on Friday backed a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and those in high-risk working and institutional settings despite calls for a narrower scope by a panel of expert advisers that would exclude the latter group.
The following describes the role and scope of advisory panels to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO U.S. HEALTH AGENCIES?
The U.S. FDA and CDC each convene advisory committees comprised of independent experts to provide advice and recommendations on a broad range of public health issues, including drug approvals. 
The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are two of these panels.
In some instances, FDA will ask its VRBPAC members to vote on whether a vaccine should be approved, and for which population. If the agency does approve the vaccine in question, the CDC will ask its ACIP committee to vote on how it should best be administered to Americans. In both committees, a simple majority vote will become the panel's recommendation.
In the case of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 booster, VRBPAC endorsed a narrower guideline than originally requested by the drugmaker. The CDC's advisers narrowed their recommendation further.
WHO SERVES ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEES?
ACIP's 15 members are mostly doctors who have expertise in how to best administer vaccines, including the timing and target populations. Candidates are nominated or can nominate themselves. Members are reimbursed for travel expenses and can receive an optional honorarium of $250 for each day the committee meets.
The membership of FDA's VRBPAC also mostly consists of doctors, many of whom specialize in infectious diseases. Candidates with minimal conflicts of interest can apply or be nominated to the FDA. Members of FDA advisory committees receive travel and per diem costs if they are accrued.
CAN THE AGENCIES DISREGARD ADVISORY COMMITTEE ADVICE?
Yes. While both agencies generally end up in agreement with the recommendations reached by their outside advisers they are not binding. The ultimate responsibility for making the final decisions rests with the heads of the respective agencies. 

""This was a scientific close call. In that situation, it was my call to make,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said of her decision for a broader booster rollout after weighing the advisory panel's recommendations.
Some scientists said Walensky was justified in insisting on additional protection for frontline workers, such as nurses and doctors caring for COVID-19 patients. Others questioned whether the broad definition of high-risk jobs opened the door to a wider use of boosters than necessary, particularly in young men who may be at higher risk of rare heart inflammation following the shots.

The Biden Administration has proposed a $52 billion investment to boost semiconductor production. Moreover, other governments and industry giants worldwide are investing heavily to keep pace with the growing demand. According to recent research from International Data Corp.

Britain's retail industry has warned the government that unless it acts to address the shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers in the next 10 days, then significant disruption was inevitable in the run-up to Christmas.
""We’re looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited,"" a spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.
Downing Street did not give any details on what the measures would be. The trucking industry has called for the government to allow short-term visas for international drivers to enter Britain and fill the gap.
As the world's fifth-largest economy emerges from COVID-19 lockdowns, a spike in European natural gas prices and a post-Brexit shortage of truck drivers have left Britain grappling with soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch.
BP (NYSE:BP) had to close some of its gas stations due to the driver shortages while queues formed at some Shell (LON:RDSa) stations as pumps ran dry in some places. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM)'s Esso said a small number of its 200 Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) Alliance retail sites had also been impacted in some way.
The government has sought to reassure the country over fuel supplies and has played down the impact of Brexit on causing the driver shortage, instead saying the COVID-19 pandemic has hindered the ability to train and test new drivers.

""We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages,"" the spokeswoman said.
""But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary COVID-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country.""

(Reuters) - More than half of companies in the S&P 500 now use a common standard from the Value Reporting Foundation to report on topics like carbon emissions and energy management, indicating executives are paying more attention to an area likely to face new regulations soon, a foundation official said.
""The market has already got a lot of momentum in the direction the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) is pushing for,"" Neil Stewart, director of corporate outreach for the global nonprofit organization, said in an interview.
As of Aug. 31, 324 companies in the S&P 500 used the foundation's standard, up from 201 companies at the end of 2020, according to the group, which is backed by large asset managers including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).
The guidance describes how companies in different sectors should disclose environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters.
The standard is also gaining more usage in non-U.S. indexes, the foundation said. Use of a different ESG effort, the Global Reporting Initiative, has also grown, with at least 10,000 users worldwide, a spokesman for the initiative said. 
The SEC this year requested public comments on how it might direct companies to report similar material on their climate impact and other areas. Agency officials did not immediately comment on Friday on the status of the review.
In a ""sample letter"" on its website, the SEC described the sort of questions it asks of companies currently.

These could include questions about litigation risks related to climate change, or requests for companies to explain why statements made in voluntary corporate social responsibility reports are different from those made in SEC filings.
""The takeaway for me is that companies should be taking this as an opportunity to re-evaluate their materiality decisions in climate matters,"" Covington attorney Matthew Franker said.

War broke out 10 months ago between Ethiopia's federal troops and forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which controls Tigray, and spread into the neighboring regions of Amhara and Afar in July. Fighting in those two regions has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and made about 1.7 million dependent on food aid.
""The escalation of the Tigray conflict, which broke out in November 2020, threatens the government's transformative reform agenda,"" S&P said in its statement. (https:// 
Last week, the Ethiopian government requested a new extended credit facility from the International Monetary Fund to replace an expired component of an existing lending program.
Meanwhile, Ethiopia's creditors' committee held its first meeting on Sept. 16 in a bid to restructure its debts under the joint G20's common framework and help create stable economic fundamentals. 
S&P expects the country's domestic markets to play an increasingly dominant role in financing Ethiopia's budget deficit over the agency's forecast through 2024. 
The agency maintained its outlook for Ethiopia at negative, which reflects potential inclusion of commercial creditors in debt restructuring plans and increasing pressures on availability of external funding.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines was fined $1.9 million Friday by the U.S. Transportation Department for violating federal rules on long tarmac delays and ordered to cease future similar violations.
The department said between December 2015 and February, United allowed 25 flights to remain on the tarmac for lengthy periods without allowing passengers to deplane.
United said Friday it remains ""committed to fully meeting all DOT rules and will continue identifying and implementing improvements in how we manage difficult operating conditions.""
The department said this is the largest fine of its kind ever imposed and impacted a total of 3,218 passengers. The Biden administration has pledged to take a tough line on airline consumer actions. 
United noted ""ultimately only 25 out of nearly 8 million flights operated by United"" and its partners warranted ""enforcement action"" over more than five years. 
Carriers are generally not allowed to keep planes on the tarmac for more than three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights without providing passengers an opportunity to deplane.
United must pay $950,000 of the fine, while United was credited with $750,000 paid in compensation for impacted passengers.
The Transportation Department said $200,000 of the assessed penalty shall be credited to United to develop ""a diversion management tool which improves United’s Network Operations Center overall situational awareness of system-wide diversions and better allows United to avoid the oversaturation of airports with diversion flights.""

United said it ""believes there is also a tension between the rules and operational decisions to position flights to take advantage of windows of opportunity to get the passengers to their ultimate destination.""
United added that since 2015 it has made substantial improvements and investments in its management of diversions.

Furthermore, a decline in consumer confidence and an uptick in jobless claims have compounded the concerns. But, ironically, the stock market’s volatility has created an ideal situation for long-term investors to buy quality stocks at low prices.
Financial planner Philip Chao, principal and chief investment officer at Experiential Wealth in Cabin John, Md., believes that “buying the dip” has been a successful strategy for a long time because stocks bought during their downturns enable investors to reap rewards when there is a rebound.

Vaccinated pregnant women pass antibodies to babies

Doctors analyzed umbilical cord blood from 36 newborns whose mothers had received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). All 36 babies had high levels of antibodies that target the spike protein on the surface of the virus - and all of the antibodies could be traced to the mothers' vaccinations. The findings, reported on Wednesday in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology - Maternal Fetal Medicine, indicate that ""the antibodies that the mother is building to the vaccine are crossing the placenta and that's likely to confer benefits for the infant after it's born,"" said coauthor Dr. Ashley Roman of NYU Langone Health in New York City. It is not clear whether the timing of vaccination during pregnancy is related to antibody levels in the baby. And, ""we don't know how long those antibodies stick around in the baby,"" Roman said. ""But the presence of these antibodies in the cord blood, which is the fetus' blood, indicates that the baby also has potential to derive benefit from maternal vaccination."" 
Scientists map antibody binding sites on virus spike
A new COVID-19 ""antibody map"" is helping researchers identify antibodies that will be able to neutralize the coronavirus even after it mutates, according to a report published on Thursday in Science. Using hundreds of antibodies collected from COVID-19 survivors around the world, a global research team mapped out exactly where each antibody attaches to the spike protein on the virus surface, which it uses to break into cells and infect them. The researchers looked for - and found - antibodies that target sites on the spike that are so important for the viral life cycle that the virus probably could not function without them. Those sites are likely to remain targets for vaccines or treatments even when the virus mutates. ""If you are making an antibody cocktail, you'd want at least one of those antibodies in there because they are probably going to maintain their efficacy against most variants,"" said coauthor Kathryn Hastie of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California, in a news release. Her team, known as the Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium, has made the map and a color-coded library of antibodies available in public databases so other scientists can access the data. 
J&J vaccine efficacy holds steady, increases with booster

A U.S. study comparing nearly 400,000 people who got the one-shot COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with 1.52 million people of similar ages, genders and health issues who were unvaccinated showed it was 79% effective at preventing confirmed coronavirus infections and 81% effective at preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations, J&J said in a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. There was no evidence of reduced effectiveness over the study's duration from March to late July - a period that included the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant, the company said. Preliminary data from a separate study suggest a second booster dose given about two months after the first shot increased the vaccine's efficacy to 94% in the United States against moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19. The company announced those latest findings on Tuesday, when half the people in the study had received the second shot at least 36 days prior. Side effects of the second dose were comparable to those seen in studies of the first shot. The data will be submitted for publication in the coming months, J&J said.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 snapped a two-week losing streak Friday, as the broader market made up early-week losses, underpinned by cyclical sectors amid renewed bets on the reflation trade.
The S&P 500 rose 0.15%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.10%, or 33 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.03%.
Cyclical sectors are back in demand as investors renew bets on the reflation trade – stocks that move in tandem with economic growth, inflation and Treasury yields -- following a climb in Treasury yields. The 10-year yield rose to 1.45% for the first time since early July. 
""The reflation trade is reflating, as 10-year yields break through some initial resistance,"" said Mark Luschini, chief Investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott  in a note. ""Small-caps, value stocks, and banks/financials … continue to be powered by a strong correlation to trends on the Treasuries.""
Rising yields – supported by expectations for tighter Federal Reserve monetary policy -- have steadied fears about the economy at a time when concerns about Chinese real estate developer Evergrande continue to linger.  Evergrande was due to make $84 million in coupon payments on Thursday, but bondholders are still waiting on it.
""Focus on the 10-year treasury … that's a key indicator of a global economy that is doing well,"" Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs told investing.com earlier this week. ""Longer-term, we need strengthening global GDP growth to sustain the rally [in equities].
Energy and financials were the biggest gainers on the day, with the latter benefiting from an ongoing move higher in bank stocks.
Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF), Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:TFC) were up more than 1%
In tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) continued to recover losses from earlier this week,  helping the broader tech sector pared some of its intraday losses.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) slipped 4% after Wells Fargo downgraded the company to equal weight from overweight, and cut its price target on the stock to $350 from $488, citing expectation for slower revenue growth ahead.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) cut its revenue forecast amid ongoing supply chain issues that led to a fiscal first-quarter revenue miss, sending the sportswear giant's shares down 6%.

This, coupled with the odds the Fed will raise interest rates in the near term, should keep driving the industry’s growth. So, we think it could be wise to add high-yield financial stocks Canadian Imperial (CM), Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU), and Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) to one’s watch list now because they have outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. Read on.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on September 22 that benchmark interest rates will be held near zero, and the central bank will continue the current pace of asset purchases. Nevertheless, the financial sector has seen a continuing recovery due to increasing financial transactions and capital market activities.
Adding to the positives, the Federal Reserve said that it could soon slow its large-scale purchases of government-backed bonds and indicated it might raise interest rates in 2022, which should help financial companies increase their interest income. Moreover, according to a Globe Newswire report, the global financial services market is expected to grow at a 9.9% CAGR to hit $22.5 trillion this year.
Therefore, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM), Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Financial, Inc. (PRU), and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) could be solid bets due to their market dominance and more than 4% dividend yield. Furthermore, these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 18.5% gains year-to-date.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>","U.S. CDC backs COVID-19 boosters for high-risk adults, workers, older Americans","By Michael Erman and Manas Mishra
(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday backed a booster shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
The decision by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky is aligned with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's authorization of the shot earlier this week and follows an August announcement of a broad booster rollout from her and other top U.S. health officials. 
The CDC recommendation cleared the way for booster shots to start on Friday. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Friday that boosters were available immediately for eligible individuals. They will also be rolled out in long-term care facilities and vaccination centers.
Walensky's decision broke from a recommendation on Thursday by a group of expert outside advisors to the agency who had said that a narrower group of people should receive the extra shot. The CDC director is not obliged to follow the advice of the panel. 
""This was a scientific close call. In that situation, it was my call to make,"" she told reporters at a White House briefing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cdc-director-says-she-overruled-advisers-boosters-protect-workers-2021-09-24. 
The advisory panel specifically excluded people in high-risk jobs and those in close living conditions due in part to concerns about a rare heart inflammation side effect that has occurred primarily in younger men. They were also concerned the recommendation would be too broad to implement effectively.
Walensky said the policy protects healthcare and frontline workers as well as religious and ethnic minority communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. 
""Many of our frontline workers, essential workers, and those in congregate settings, come from communities that have already been hardest hit,"" she said. ""It was a decision about providing rather than withholding access."" 
The panel did recommend boosters for older people and some with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19.
The authorization opens boosters to more than 20 million people who received their second Pfizer/BioNTech shot more than six months ago.
The CDC on Thursday told its advisers that there would be no requirements to submit documentation to prove that people have the underlying conditions or work in at-risk settings. 
Scientists have been divided over the need for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, with some including those from the FDA and the World Health Organization saying there is inadequate evidence that they are needed by anyone other than older people and that priority should be given to people around the world who have yet to receive a first shot. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and U.S. health officials have argued https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-looks-covid-19-boosters-curb-virus-spread-2021-09-15 that the boosters prevent hospitalizations and deaths and that emerging data indicates they can slow mild infections as well.
The highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus has driven a surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States that peaked on Sept. 1 and has since fallen about 25% to just over 120,000 cases per day, based on a 7-day moving average.
Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has said the country needs to get down to around 10,000 cases a day to see an end to the health crisis in the United States. 
'ANYONE CAN SHOW UP'
SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said he expects many of the ""worried well"" to seek booster shots in the coming weeks because of the CDC's loose requirement on who is eligible.
""That literally means anyone can show up and say I’m at an increased risk of getting re-infected,"" Porges said.
The United States had authorized extra shots for those with compromised immune systems last month and around 2.3 million people have already received a third shot, according to the CDC.
Because the FDA has not yet considered  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s application for boosters and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has not yet applied for one, Pfizer is likely to benefit, he said.
Pfizer shares were down less than 1% on Friday, while Moderna shares fell 5%.
Bernd Salzberger, head of infectiology at Regensburg University Hospital in Germany, said given uncertainty over the durability of protection, experts could easily come to different conclusions over who should be eligible for boosters and when.
The CDC said people 65 years and older should get a booster and also recommended the shots for all adults over 50 with underlying conditions, such as cancer or diabetes.
It said, based on individual benefits and risks, 18- to 49-year-olds with underlying medical conditions may get a booster, and also people 18 to 64 at increased risk of exposure and transmission due to occupational or institutional settings.
The CDC said about 26 million people would now be eligible for a Pfizer/BioNTech booster, including 13 million aged 65 or older. 

William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the shots will be widely available under this policy.
""I’m skeptical that locations will be overwhelmed, but there may be some locations, particularly in high-income neighborhoods, where they might get a lot of people interested,"" Schaffner said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Shares in Russia's Novatek recovered from an early tumble on Friday after the arrest in the United States of its deputy head, Mark Gyetvay, viewed by analysts as a key figure in investor relations as the gas producer expands.
The U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday that Gyetvay had been arrested on tax charges related to $93 million hidden in offshore accounts. Gyetvay, who holds passports from both the United States and Russia, faces a lengthy prison sentence if convicted.
Novatek said in a statement it was seeking details of the arrest but added the move would not affect the firm's operations.
After falling as much as 4% in early trading on Friday, shares recovered to trade slightly up by the evening.
Novatek said Gyetvay had left the company's board of directors and the position of chief financial officer in 2014, saying that he ""subsequently was not involved in financial activities of the company, including attracting financing.""
Gyetvay has been the leading voice at Novatek, anchoring conference calls with investors and presenting the company at industry events as it seeks funds for liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
""He has played an important role in the company's strategic planning and he has been pivotal in establishing the excellent relations the company has with its shareholder base. Therefore, we expect a negative stock reaction in the short term,"" Russian VTB Bank said in a note to clients.
Gyetvay was ordered released on a $80 million bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Frazier of the federal court for Florida's Middle District, according to court filings.
He was also ordered to appear before Judge Frazier on Sept. 30 for a bond status hearing.
Gyetvay did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Novatek declined to comment beyond its earlier statement.
New Jersey-born Gyetvay, 64, moved to Russia in 1995, working as a partner at PwC Global Energy. Russian President Vladimir Putin granted him a Russian passport in 2019, when he was at Novatek, in a move seen as potentially helping the U.S. national bypass some U.S. sanctions restrictions.
A Kremlin spokesperson said Russian diplomats were ready to provide legal assistance to Gyetvay in the United States.
""Because this individual is also a citizen of the Russian Federation, if I understand this correctly, he has dual citizenship, of course we are interested in his future and the circumstances of the case,"" Dmitry Peskov told a conference call.
Novatek commissioned Yamal LNG, its first LNG plant in the Arctic, in 2017. The project challenges state-controlled Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which has a monopoly on Russian gas via pipeline.

It wants to build more LNG plants in the Russian Arctic and is in the middle of efforts to attract more than 9 billion euros ($11 billion) for its Arctic LNG 2 project, to be raised from the Russian banks, Japan, China and others.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy's Treasury is confident it will be able to announce a deal to sell selected parts of state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi (MPS) to rival UniCredit next month, four sources close to the matter told Reuters on Friday.
A slowdown in talks ahead of a vote on Oct. 3-4 in MPS' hometown of Siena to fill a vacant parliamentary seat had raised doubts over the chances of an agreement, weighing on the Tuscan bank's riskier debt this week.
Italy's No.2 bank UniCredit agreed on July 29 to enter exclusive negotiations with Rome over MPS, which is 64% owned by the state following a 2017 bailout that cost taxpayers 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion).
Three of the sources said the parties had yet to exchange a comprehensive set of figures on the final terms of the deal, which Rome will need to run past European Union authorities to ensure it complies with rules on state aid to banks.
The parties are expected to show their hands in full only after the October vote, which may prompt the leader of the Democratic Party, a member of Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition, to resign if he fails to win the Siena seat. 
UniCredit declined to comment.
Italy has set aside 1.5 billion euros to recapitalise MPS in light of the sale, but two of the sources said it was too early to put a number on the final size of the cash call. It could even be lower than the sum earmarked, one source said.
The cost of the re-privatisation and the prospect of thousands of early staff exits at MPS ahead of the sale have fanned political opposition to the deal.
On Friday, lawmakers in the right-wing League party said it would be a mistake to undersell the world's oldest bank, as MPS' workers went on a strike to back unions' demands to have a role in the talks.
UniCredit, which had discussed an MPS deal with the Treasury under previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, will only consider an acquisition that leaves its capital buffers unaffected and boosts earnings per share by 10%.

New Unicredit (MI:CRDI) CEO Andrea Orcel wants to grow the lender's presence in Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and the Veneto, while leaving behind MPS' branches in Italy's poorer south - as well as any problem or risky loans and legal risks stemming from mismanagement.

(Reuters) - The United States is rolling out booster shots https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-65-older-high-risk-2021-09-23 of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for some Americans who received their second jab at least six months ago. The following explains the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decision on who can and should get shots now.
WHICH OLDER AMERICANS SHOULD GET A SHOT AND WHY?
The CDC said people aged 65 and over, which make up nearly 17% of the U.S. population, should get a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot now if they previously received that vaccine. 
Over 13.6 million people in that age group had received a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least six months ago, according to CDC data.
While scientists are divided over the need for a booster dose, data has shown declining protection of the vaccine against hospitalizations in older adults due to the dominance of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus. Some studies suggest that vaccine efficacy wanes over time for that group. 
WHO QUALIFIES AS ""HIGH-RISK""?
The CDC said people aged 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions should receive a booster, and that it may be given to those aged 18 to 49 based on their individual benefits and risks. 
The high-risk medical group includes people who are more susceptible to developing severe COVID-19 such as those with diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease and certain heart conditions. Smokers and pregnant women are also likely to be eligible for a booster dose, experts say. 
The FDA and CDC said that people aged 18 to 64 can be considered to be at high risk based on COVID-19 exposure at work or where they live. They did not define at-risk work and the CDC said boosters are available based on people saying they need one.
The FDA said such workers include those in healthcare settings, teachers and day care staff as well as grocery workers among others. It also said they include people living in homeless shelters or prisons. 
The CDC estimates over 50 million people would eventually be eligible for booster shots under such a recommendation, but that figure also includes recipients of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines. 
WHEN AND WHERE?
White House advisers have said boosters should be available immediately at roughly 80,000 locations nationwide including pharmacies, state vaccination centers and long-term care facilities, at no cost. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are on the list of eligible recipients. 
Retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have said they are ready to administer booster shots. 
WHAT ABOUT MODERNA AND J&J?
Only Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine has been authorized as a third booster dose so far. 

Moderna applied to FDA for authorization of a third dose of its vaccine earlier this month. Johnson & Johnson has not yet applied for authorization of what would be a second shot for it's one-dose vaccine, but has said it plans to do so.
The CDC said it will look to address the recommendations for the Moderna and J&J boosters ""with the same sense of urgency,"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, as soon as the data is available.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on high-yield dividend stocks PJSC LUKOIL (LUKOY (OTC:LUKOY)), Dow (DOW), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) FEMSA (KOF), and Vector Group (NYSE:VGR) to ensure a steady income stream. These stocks have an overall ‘Strong Buy’ rating in our proprietary rating system. So, let’s take a closer look.After a weak start to the week, the major stock market indexes have rallied over the past two days, with investors looking past the Evergrande debt crisis in China. The market also sloughed off the Federal Reserve’s announcement on September 22 that it will likely reduce its monthly bond purchases as soon as November.
However, according to The Conference Board, the consumer confidence index came in at 113.8 in August, its lowest level since February. COVID-19 cases are on the rise too. So, many still expect the stock market to decline significantly in the near term. Therefore, we think it could be wise to invest now in high-yield quality dividend stocks to secure a steady income stream. British global asset management group Janus Henderson upgraded its global 2021 dividend forecast to $1.39 trillion from $1.36 trillion, just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak.
The high dividend yields and strong fundamentals of PJSC LUKOIL (LUKOY), Dow Inc. (DOW), Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF), and  Vector Group Ltd . (VGR) make them solid picks now. These companies have paid dividends consistently and have an overall A (Strong Buy) rating in our POWR Ratings system.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's moves to crack down on bitcoin trading dealt another blow to Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund, which outperformed all other U.S. equity funds last year but is now mired among the worst of its peers. 
Wood, who has said that bitcoin will rally to $500,000, has slightly more than $1 billion invested in cryptocurrency trading firm Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc, a position that makes up approximately 4.7% of her $21.7 billion fund. Shares of Coinbase fell more than 1.5% on Friday after Chinese regulators announced a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining.
China's move triggered a selloff in bitcoin, taking the value of the world's largest cryptocurrency down more than 5% to approximately $42,475. 
ARK Innovation was down 1.4% in midday trading on Friday. 
The declines come as several of Wood's top holdings this year are floundering during a market rally that has pushed up the benchmark S&P 500 more than 18% for the year to date. 
(GRAPHIC: Cathie's ARK under water - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykgjqypg/Pasted%20image%201632499826762.png)
While shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Wood's top holding, are up 8% for the year, large positions in companies including Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc are down 20% or more over the same time amid a shift away from the stay-at-home technology stocks that dominated during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020.
ARK Invest did not respond to a request for comment on this story. 
Overall, the ARK Innovation Fund is down 4.4% for the year to date, putting it in the bottom 100th percentile among the 595 other U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar. 
Over the last five years, however, the fund is up an annualized 42.3% a year, placing it among the top 1 percentile in its category. 

That strong long-term performance is likely what is keeping retail investors from selling their stake in the fund this year despite its poor showing, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at CFRA. 
""ARKK is down for the year and has significantly lagged behind index-based growth ETFs yet most investors have remained loyal, likely due to fond memories of prior periods of relatively strong performance,"" he said. ""But as the recent period of underperformance persists it is harder to justify not considering alternatives.""

Investing.com – Dave & Buster’s (NASDAQ:PLAY) and  The Cheesecake Factory  (NASDAQ:CAKE) shares rose Friday trading after Jefferies' (NYSE:JEF) called them both a buy, according to StreetInsider.
Dave & Buster rose 6% and Cheesecake was up 5%.
The other restaurants figuring in Jefferies’ list are BJ's (NASDAQ:BJRI), Chuy's (NASDAQ:CHUY) and  Red Robin Gourmet  (NASDAQ:RRGB). Each of the first two traded around 7% higher while Red Robin was up short of 2%.
Analyst Andy Barish sees Dave & Buster’s at $56, 33% higher than the stock’s current level. He sees 21% appreciation in Cheesecake to $60. BJ’s and Chuy’s will have to rise by 22% each from their current prices to hit Barish’s target of $55 and $41 for the two stocks, respectively. The analyst sees Red Robin at $31, a rise of 27% from the current level.
As per Jefferies’ research, weekly same-store sales and foot traffic data and company reports show signs of resiliency and less of a slowdown than what investors might have expected.
Barish cited multiple factors for his optimism in the five restaurant stocks, StreetInsider said, including multi-year market share growth opportunity for casual dining chains and a permanent increase in sales for off-premise-consumption. Sustainable operational efficiencies, pricing flexibility and higher volumes will also help margins, as per the report.
Barish also believes the current valuations are too hard to ignore."

(Reuters) -European stocks fell on Friday as worries about troubled property developer China Evergrande and weak German business confidence data prompted investors to book some profits after a mid-week rally.
European sportswear makers Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Puma and JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports fell about 3% each after U.S. rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) cut its fiscal 2022 sales expectations and predicted delays during the holiday shopping season due to a supply chain crunch.
Retail stocks were the top decliners in Europe, down 1.7%, while the region-wide STOXX 600 fell 0.9%. But a three-day rally put the index 0.3% higher for the week. 
""Equities have rallied to take a pause early this morning faced with the likely default of Evergrande,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
Investor worries over Evergrande resurfaced as a deadline for paying $83.5 million in bond interest passed without remark from the company, putting it closer to a potential default.
Meanwhile, a survey by Ifo Institute showed German business morale in September fell for a third straight month, hit by supply chain woes that are causing a ""bottleneck recession"" for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy.
Germany's DAX fell 0.7%, heading into the weekend when the country will vote to elect German Chancellor Angela Merkel's successor.
Latest polls showed the Social Democrats were clinging to a narrow lead over the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, while the Greens trailed. [nS8N2OY01Q]
""Some of the hesitancy in European markets could also be put down to the German elections, which promise to be the most interesting in some time,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
""Markets are facing a change of direction in Germany unlike anything seen in the past decade or more, and the end of Merkel's tenure promises to be a watershed moment for the EU and global investors alike."" 
The benchmark STOXX 600 is on course to end September in the red after seven consecutive months of gains as rising energy prices and supply-chain bottlenecks fed into fears of inflation, while major central banks plan to cut pandemic-era stimulus. 
However, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in an interview aired on CNBC that many of the drivers of a recent spike in euro zone inflation are temporary and could fade in the next year.

British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) rose 2.0% after the company said its cancer drug Lynparza met its primary goal in a late-stage trial.
Italy's utilities  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Eni inched higher after the government set aside more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) to curb a strong increase in retail energy bills.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Britain's WPP (LON:WPP) has agreed to pay more than $19 million in a settlement with U.S. authorities relating to bribery allegations and accounting controls for its subsidiaries, including in India and China.
The world's largest advertising firm did not admit or deny allegations that it violated provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but agreed to pay the penalty, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.
The SEC order found that WPP failed to ensure that subsidiaries it acquired implemented its internal accounting controls and compliance policies.
WPP implemented an aggressive business growth strategy that included acquiring majority interests in many localized advertising agencies in high-risk markets, it said, citing potential conflicts in India, China, Brazil and Peru during a period between 2013 and 2018.
WPP said it had changed its business practices since then.
""As the Commission's Order recognises, WPP's new leadership has put in place robust new compliance measures and controls, fundamentally changed its approach to acquisitions, cooperated fully with the Commission and terminated those involved in misconduct,"" the company said in a statement.
WPP founder Martin Sorrell, who declined to comment to Reuters on the settlement, led the company for more than 30 years before he quit in April 2018. He was replaced as chief executive by Mark Read, another company veteran.
WPP failed to ""promptly or adequately respond to repeated warning signs of corruption or control failures at certain subsidiaries,"" the SEC said.
In one example cited by the commission, a subsidiary in India continued to bribe Indian government officials in return for advertising contracts even though WPP had received seven anonymous complaints relating to the conduct.

""A company cannot allow a focus on profitability or market share to come at the expense of appropriate controls,"" said SEC FCPA Unit Chief Charles Cain. 
Friday's move comes as the nation's top securities watchdog seeks to stamp out abuses in U.S. markets due to a lack of required controls by companies.

The company's U.S.-listed shares rose 3.1% to $25.48 as the Cunard cruise line owner said its core earnings will break even early next year and be above pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
The cruise sector was among those most affected by the pandemic in 2020 as many ships docked at ports and anchored offshore for months, forcing operators to raise billions of dollars in debt to stay afloat.
Cruise enthusiasts are looking forward to the resumption of more voyages from U.S. ports after the country's health officials gave the green light earlier this year to restart sailings.
Eight of Carnival (NYSE:CUK)'s nine brands have resumed sailings, and it expects more than half its total fleet capacity to be open for guests by the end of October.
""We're planning to have the full fleet on in time for the summer season where we make the bulk of our profits,"" Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said.
Carnival said its voyages for the third quarter were cash flow positive, as people spent more at bars, casinos and spas on board, adding that it expects the cash flow trend to continue.
The company said its booking trends have seen an uptick in recent weeks after demand for near-term sailings last month took a hit due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group have also pointed to strong booking trends for next year's cruises.

However, Carnival expects its fourth-quarter monthly average cash burn rate to be higher than the $510 million during the third quarter.
The company's quarterly adjusted loss widened to $1.99 billion from $1.70 billion a year earlier.

Generali (MI:GASI)'s board meets on Monday to discuss whether to submit its own slate of nominees, including Donnet, ahead of a general meeting next spring to name new directors. Donnet has come under pressure from some major shareholders who are critical of his strategy. 
The resolution of the appointments committee, which came at a meeting attended by representatives of Generali's main shareholders, was taken by a majority vote, the sources added. One of the sources said there were four votes in favor of Donnet out of seven.
Construction magnate Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio and charity organization Fondazione CRT, who control a combined 12.5% of Generali, in recent weeks struck a shareholder pact to consult over decisions concerning Generali.
Caltagirone, 78, and Del Vecchio, 86, consider Donnet's M&A strategy insufficiently ambitious and want to replace him, sources have previously said. 
Donnet has the backing of Alberto Nagel, CEO of Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), Italy's top investment bank and the main Generali investor, with 17% of voting rights. 
In a move that could potentially give them more clout over Generali, both Del Vecchio and Caltagirone have built stakes in Mediobanca.

If Generali's board decides on Monday to submit its own slate of nominees which includes Donnet as CEO, the two tycoons are ready to file a separate list with an alternative CEO candidate, sources said earlier this month.
Italy's Benetton family, which owns 4% of Generali but has no representatives on its board, has yet to take sides. Del Vecchio and Caltagirone will also have to contend with institutional investors, which own around 40% of Generali, Europe's third-largest insurer.

With $305 billion in liabilities, Evergrande is struggling to meet debt obligations and global markets are watching for signs of default.
Here is a timeline of this week's developments.
MONDAY, SEPT. 20:
Evergrande shares in Hong Kong hit lowest level since 2010. Global equity markets wobble on contagion fears. The S&P 500 suffers its biggest one-day drop in four months.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings says it does not expect Beijing to provide any direct support to the company.
The cost of insuring China against default rises to near one-year high. Yuan currency comes under pressure.

The company will ""walk out of its darkest moment"" and resume full-scale construction as soon as possible, the developer's chairman says in a letter to staff.
Evergrande missed interest payments due Monday to at least two of its largest bank creditors, Bloomberg reports. The missed payments had been expected as China's housing ministry had said the company would be unable to pay on time.
Fund giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and investment banks HSBC and UBS have been among the largest buyers of Evergrande’s debt, Morningstar data shows.

Investing.com – Baidu stock (NASDAQ:BIDU) fell more than 2% Friday on a Reuters report that China's antitrust regulator is unlikely to approve its $3.6 billion acquisition of JOYY’s video-based domestic live streaming business YY Live.
The cash deal was announced in November.
As per the report, the approval will send a wrong message to the market at a time when the government has taken steps to discourage gaming-related businesses and corporate expansion via deals.
Beijing has been concerned about children’s exposure to video games and last month set new rules limiting the time under-18s can spend playing them.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>","HSBC, StanChart may face secondary shockwaves from Evergrande crisis -analysts","By Lawrence White and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) could face spillover damage to their profits and balance sheets from the debt crisis enveloping China Evergrande Group even though the two banks say they have limited their direct exposure, analysts have warned.
Other banks and insurers could also suffer indirect effects such as loss of fees or a devaluation of their investments. 
HSBC and StanChart make a big chunk of their profits in China and Hong Kong and they have been the foreign banks most involved in underwriting syndicated loans for developers there. That means they are likely to face the most immediate second-order impacts, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a research report.
HSBC and Standard Chartered both declined to comment on the report.
Evergrande has left global investors guessing over whether it will make a key interest payment, adding to fears of big losses for bondholders and sending tremors through China's property sector and economy.
Hong Kong and mainland China accounted for around 84% of HSBC's profits in 2020 while Greater China and North Asia contributed 81% of StanChart's profits last year, according to a Reuters analysis of filings by the two companies - underscoring the region's importance to their overall businesses.
The two have the most direct lending exposure among foreign banks to China's property sector - $17 billion or 1.5% of group assets for HSBC and $1.3 billion or 0.5% of group loans at StanChart, according to JPMorgan.
The property sector contributes 14% of China's GDP or 25% if indirect contributions are included, JPMorgan said, and property loans are worth some 6.6% of total loans, meaning a hit to the sector could have significant wider economic impacts.
HSBC and Standard Chartered have both said they have no direct exposure to Evergrande, and that they have taken steps in recent years to carefully manage their exposures to any one sector.
HSBC has already sold all positions in its China bond or Asia credit portfolios with exposure to Evergrande, a source at the bank said.
Citing Dealogic data, JPMorgan said HSBC has been involved in underwriting 39 outstanding syndicated loans for Chinese developers while StanChart has worked on 18 such deals, which could come under pressure if there are wider property sector defaults. 
In a syndicated loan banks typically underwrite the deal and then sell the debt to other investors, but may keep some of the exposure on their books.
""There is a risk that this is not an idiosyncratic event but an industry-wide problem which could result in significant spillover damage,"" JPMorgan said.
The U.S. bank said it estimates there could be a further 11 defaults worth some $30 billion this year across the Chinese high-yield property sector, amounting to a 23% default rate.
MARKET CHILL
Other European financial firms also face a negative impact on business lines such as capital markets, asset management and private banking, said Dierk Brandenburg, head of financial institutions at ratings agency Scope.
""These will impact the profit and loss figures of Europe's globally active banks in the coming quarters, as could the ensuing regulatory crackdown by Chinese authorities,"" he said.
Chinese real-estate companies have tapped the public U.S. dollar bond market for $274 billion in the past five years, Scope analysts said, citing Bond Radar data, suggesting foreign banks could lose out on fees if such deals dwindle.
Insurers' investment portfolios could also be affected, said Volker Kudszus, Sector Lead for EMEA Insurance at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
""We are not concerned by direct exposure of European insurers to Evergrande, but indirect exposure, e.g. through investments in the Chinese equity or real estate market, might see some volatility,"" Kudszus said. 
Insurers Prudential (NYSE:PUK), Ageas and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) were likely to have the most exposure to Chinese real estate, Morningstar analysts said this week.
Ageas said its Chinese joint venture company had no direct exposure to Evergrande but around 2% of the corporate bond portfolio was invested in highly-rated Chinese real estate debt.
""Only further widespread spillover to the general stock markets would have an impact on our results,"" an Ageas spokesperson said.
Prudential Chief Executive Mike Wells told CNBC this week that the insurer's exposure to Evergrande was ""de minimis"", and that less than 5% of the insurer's bond holdings were in Chinese real estate.

Prudential also has a joint venture in China.
Swiss Re did not have direct investments in Chinese property in its real estate portfolio, a spokesperson said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co's India head Anurag Mehrotra has quit the company to pursue other career opportunities, days after the U.S. automaker said it would stop making cars in the Asian nation https://reut.rs/3uaF8tN, taking a hit of $2 billion.
Mehrotra, according to his LinkedIn profile, has spent over a decade with Ford in India across multiple roles including marketing, sales and most recently as president and managing director.
Sept. 30 will be Mehrotra's last day, a source with knowledge of the information told Reuters. 
Mehrotra did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ford India said in its statement it has put its director of manufacturing, Balasundaram Radhakrishnan, in charge of overseeing its restructuring in the country.
Ford's decision to stop making cars in India ends its more than two-decade long presence in a market https://reut.rs/2XJDX8v it no longer sees as profitable. The move will affect around 4,000 employees, the company has said. 
Ford is the fifth major automaker to cease vehicle manufacturing in India since 2017, following exits by General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Harley Davidson from a market that is dominated by Asian rivals. 
Despite being in India since the mid-1990s, Ford has less than 2% share of the passenger vehicle market and was using about 20% of its total production capacity of 440,000 cars a year across two plants. 

Ford said earlier this month it plans to wind down production at its western India plant by the end of this year and at its southern India plant by the second quarter of 2022. 
The announcement has upset hundreds of its factory workers, some of whom protested the decision this week https://reut.rs/39ARJNi.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday, unsettled by fresh comments from the Federal Reserve about the pace of monetary policy tightening, and by doubts about China Evergrande, the real estate developer teetering on the brink of default.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68 points, or 0.2% at 34,696 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%. That leaves the Dow on course for a narrow weekly gain, but the S&P and Nasdaq on course for a loss. 
Before trading began, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester spelled out in detail what Fed Chair Jerome Powell had hinted at in his press conference on Wednesday, namely that the Fed is likely to run down its bond purchases relatively quickly from November, and may well raise interest rates by the end of next year. Mester said in a speech that the U.S. economy had met the conditions necessary to allow monetary policy to be tightened.
""I support starting to dial back our purchases in November and concluding them over the first half of next year,"" Mester said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Ohio Bankers League. Mester also warned of 'froth' in both equity and housing markets in the U.S. New home sales data for August released at 10 AM came out slightly stronger than expected, adding to evidence of sustained housing market strength that was also seen in housing starts and building permit data this week. 
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock stood out in early trading, falling by 5.6%, the most in six months, after the company said supply chain disruptions threaten its near-term outlook. The company has lost 10 weeks of production from its factories in Vietnam due to Covid lockdowns, and it also faces big delays in getting shipping containers across the Pacific. That's raising doubts as to what shape inventories will be in when the key holiday season starts.  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) stock fell 2.6% and Adidas ADRs (OTC:ADDYY) fell 3.2%, but such problems are hardly unique to sportswear makers.
By contrast, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stock rose 2.2% after a strong quarterly update that featured renewed hoarding of essentials by customers in response to the summer's Delta-variant Covid-19 wave.
China worries also weighed on sentiment in early trading after reports that the beleaguered Evergrande had failed to pay interest to all holders of one of its dollar bonds by Thursday's deadline, technically tipping it into default. The company still has a 30-day grace period to meet its commitments, but it also has more interest and principal payments due in that time. The growing sense of risk around Chinese asset and Chinese markets was reinforced as HNA Group, a conglomerate that also overreached itself with debt-fueled growth, said its chairman and CEO had both been arrested in connection with suspected criminal activity. 
 Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) fell 3.6%, after the e-commerce giant sold its minority stake in a state-controlled broadcaster, reportedly under pressure from regulators.

Investing.com – Shares of blockchain- and crypto-related companies were taking a beating Friday as authorities in China vowed a strict crackdown against digital currencies.
Crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) fell 4% on Nasdaq. Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA), Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT), Hut 8 Mining (TSX:HUT_t) and Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) fell 7% to 8% in premarket trading.
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), one of the biggest Bitcoin investors among listed companies, fell 6%.  Argo Blockchain  (LON:ARB) dropped 13% in London trading.
The warnings led to a slump in the value of Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) and other digital currencies as well. The largest cryptocurrency slumped below the  $41,000-level and then recouped it. Ethereum ETH/USD fell 19% and Dogecoin DOGE/USD 16%.
People’s Bank of China reiterated its long-held view that all digital currency activities are illegal while pledging to crack down on the market.
“Financial institutions and non-bank payment institutions cannot offer services to activities and operations related to virtual currencies,” according to a translation of comments the central bank posted as a Q&A on its website.
The PBOC also advised banks and payment institutions like Ant Group Co Ltd (HK:6688) against providing crypto-linked services.
It’s not the first time China has talked tough on cryptocurrencies. Beijing cracked down on cryptos earlier in June, forcing many mining bases to shut. Before that, China accounted for more than half of global Bitcoin mining production.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top banks and asset managers have thrown their weight behind proposals in Britain to scrap curbs on share trading after billions of euros in daily stock dealings left London for Amsterdam due to Brexit.
The finance ministry proposed the changes in its review of wholesale capital markets to help maintain London's competitiveness as a global financial centre after largely being cut off from the European Union since December.
A rule Britain inherited from the bloc known as the share trading obligation mandates that market participants must use specific venues like stock exchanges to trade.
In their responses to the ministry's public consultation on a welter of draft reforms, UK Finance, which represents banks in Britain, and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, whose members include big international banks and asset managers, both backed scrapping the STO to increase competition.
""We agree with UK authorities that the removal of the STO is necessary to ensure that UK-based firms have the ability to execute trades on the venues where they will achieve optimal results for their clients,"" AFME said.
""We agree this obligation should be removed as it has simply imposed unnecessary costs upon liquidity providers and trading venues without any corresponding benefits,"" said UK Finance, adding that its removal would not lead to any negative consequences.
The prospect of returning to an effective free-for-all in share trading has raised some concerns, however.
Michael Horan, director, head of trading, EMEA, at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK)'s Pershing, told Reuters last month that scrapping the STO could create an ""explosion"" in more trading venues.

""It could be a bit too much, too soon in terms of making changes. We don't want a return to... where liquidity was over fragmented, and therefore harder to police,"" Horan said.
Following responses to its public consultation, the finance ministry is expected to publish final plans for reforming the wholesale market in coming weeks.

Nike lost 10 weeks of production in Vietnam during the period and said it would take several months to restore full production. Lockdowns in many parts of the country are set to last at least until the end of September, according to Reuters.
The Asian country was forced to order factories to shut in July as the pandemic ravaged through capital Ho Chi Minh City and areas around it.
Shipping and transport challenges also continued as congestion at ports mounted and truck drivers remained in short supply. As a result, inventories of both raw materials and finished products stayed low.
Nike now expects 2022 sales growth to be around 5% compared to the low-double-digit increase it previously estimated. Second-quarter revenue growth is seen between flat and up 3%.
First-quarter revenue rose 16% to $12.2 billion. Earnings per share rose 22% to $1.16 and beat estimates. Costs termed ‘demand creation expense’ by the company rose 36% and were the key reason why Nike’s selling and administrative expenses were higher by 20%.  "

ZURICH (Reuters) - A potential lurch to the left in Germany's election on Sunday is scaring millionaires into moving assets into Switzerland, bankers and tax lawyers say.
If the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), hard-left Linke and environmentalist Greens come to power, the reintroduction of a wealth tax and a tightening of inheritance tax could be on the political agenda.
""For the super-rich, this is red hot,"" said a German-based tax lawyer with extensive Swiss operations. ""Entrepreneurial families are highly alarmed."" 
The move shows how many rich people still see Switzerland as an attractive place to park wealth, despite its efforts to abolish its image as a billionaires' safe haven.
No country has more offshore assets than Switzerland and inflows accelerated in 2020, to the benefit of big banks such as UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Julius Baer. Geopolitical tensions and fears of the COVID-19 pandemic's economic fallout made Switzerland's political stability attractive. 
Bank for International Settlements data show deposits of German households and companies at banks in Switzerland climbed almost $5 billion to $37.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, and this does not include shares, bonds or financial products. More recent figures are not available, but insiders say the inflows have continued. ""I have booked an above-average amount of new money as in the past three months,"" said a veteran client adviser at a large Swiss bank who deals mainly with Germans.
""Many wealthy people, especially entrepreneurs, fear that there will be a lurch to the left in Germany - no matter how the elections turn out,"" says Florian Dürselen, head of Europe at wealth manager LGT Switzerland. 
One top Swiss banker said: ""I know a number of German entrepreneurs who want to have a foothold outside Germany if things get too red (leftist) there.""
TAX ON ASSETS
A poll on Thursday showed the SPD, on 25%, leading outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives by four points. The SPD wants to reintroduce a wealth tax and increase inheritance tax, while the Greens - a likely potential coalition partner - plan to tax fortunes more heavily. Although both envision raising income tax for top earners, a tax on assets would raise much more money, the tax lawyer said.
He was seeing increased demand for advice from clients, he said, noting some entrepreneurs had sought to protect themselves by making new investments through a company in Switzerland or transferring assets to a foundation in Liechtenstein.
Simply transferring cash to a Swiss bank account, on the other hand, no longer helps. Under immense international pressure, the Swiss now share such account data with tax authorities in clients' home countries.
""Switzerland as a financial centre is characterized by stability, legal security and a high level of financial competence. However, it does not offer any protection against tax evasion,"" said a spokesperson for the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF). 

LGT's Dürselen said he recently spoke with a German entrepreneur who feared Germany could soon tax foreign assets or transactions harshly, which fostered the view of Switzerland as a safe haven for capital. 
""Personally, I assume that considerable assets will continue to be moved to Switzerland,"" he said. One local politician said dozens of wealthy German entrepreneurs have inquired in recent months about residing in one of the low-tax suburbs along Lake Zurich.

In March, Uber (NYSE:UBER) had reclassified its more than 70,000 drivers in Britain as workers following a Supreme Court ruling. Uber had also said it would offer guaranteed entitlements, including holiday pay, a pension plan and limited minimum wage.
On Friday, the Silicon Valley company said it would contribute 3% of a driver's earnings into a pension plan, while drivers can choose to contribute a minimum of 5% of their qualifying earnings.
Britain's GMB union represents Uber's drivers in the country, and has the right to negotiate on behalf of the workforce.
Uber and GMB also urged other ride-hailing companies like Ola, Bolt and Addison Lee to offer similar benefits to their drivers.
""I am extending an invitation to work with operators such as Bolt, Addison Lee and Ola to create a cross-industry pension scheme. This will enable all drivers to save for their futures whilst working across multiple platforms,"" said Jamie Heywood, an executive for Uber's northern and eastern European region. 
Britain's Pensions Regulator said it noted the ""positive steps"" taken by Uber and called on all gig economy employers to enrol eligible staff in pension schemes.
""The gig economy is set to grow further as the UK emerges from the pandemic and businesses recover and it is only right that all workers contributing to the economy receive the pensions they are entitled to,"" a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

The regulator would take enforcement action against employers who did not enrol staff ""voluntarily and promptly"", the spokesperson added.
Uber's drivers will be auto-enrolled in a pension scheme provided by NOW: Pensions and managed by workplace solutions provider  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN), the company added.

Investing.com – Costco stock (NASDAQ:COST) traded 0.8% higher in Friday’s premarket as the company overrode cost and supply-side pressures in the fourth quarter to beat all estimates.
Total revenue jumped more than 17% on-year to $62.67 billion as people continued to stock up on essential goods, continuing a pandemic-era spending pattern that was given a new lease of life by the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 this summer.
Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti told analysts Thursday that the company is running out of many of its general items within two weeks and “ordering as much as we can” to replenish the stocks.
The retailer has also placed  purchasing limits on selected items, where the fear of Delta has led to a surge in demand. These include toilet paper, paper towels, water and some cleaning items, Galanti told analysts.
Merchandise costs and selling expenses both rose.
Net income rose 20% to $1.67 billion even as the company faced cost pressures due to labor crunch, higher wages, shipping charges and congestion at ports -- problem confronting all manufacturers and retailers as they grapple with high demand on one side and disturbed supplies due to lockdowns on the other.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",Evergrande's billionaire boss exuded calm as crisis grew,"(Refile to add dropped words in 5th paragraph)
By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Mingling with power brokers at celebrations to mark the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1, a beaming Hui Ka Yan showed no signs that his company, China Evergrande, was facing mounting pressure with debt repayments.
Hui, wearing a navy-blue suit and open-neck shirt, looked relaxed as he stood on a podium overlooking the festivities in Tiananmen Square, an invitation many considered a show of support for the billionaire businessman. 
A month earlier, the Evergrande group chairman had hosted a rare meeting with more than 1,000 suppliers and was once again flanked by the business elite as he spoke of his deleveraging goals.
But now Hui's highly leveraged business strategy is unravelling.
Evergrande missed a deadline this week to make an interest payment on a dollar bond, moving closer to a potential default.
Beijing's tightening of the rules around debt and speculation in the property sector have tipped Evergrande into a liquidity crisis and with liabilities equivalent to around 1.97 trillion yuan ($302 billion) - roughly the size of Finland's GDP - markets are on tenterhooks about contagion risk. 
Evergrande and Hui did not respond to requests for comment. 
In a September letter, Hui expressed appreciation for the hard work of employees and said Evergrande will deliver property projects as pledged, and fulfil responsibilities to property buyers, investors, partners and financial institutions.
He has not made any public appearance since the party centenary on July 1, although recent photos on the company website show him in various internal meetings, vowing to deliver homes to buyers and repay people who invested in the group's wealth management products.
The 62-year-old former steel technician, raised by his grandmother in a rural village in central Henan province, founded Evergrande in 1996 in southern Guangzhou city and built his fortune on the back of low-priced homes.
Under Hui, the property developer expanded aggressively by raising loans to support its land buying sprees and selling homes at lower margins for quick turnover. Evergrande grew to 700 billion yuan ($108 billion) in annual sales by 2020.
In 2017, Hui was Asia's richest man with a net worth of $45.3 billion, according to Forbes. Today his net worth is estimated at $13.4 billion.
Hui keeps a low public profile and is a workaholic who at times demands that others follow his work style, three employees told Reuters.
He also set ambitious targets. When questioned by investors and reporters in the past decade about his highly leveraged projects, Hui said that Evergrande's high turnover and asset value were sufficient to cover its debts.
POKER PALS
Hui did not shy away from new ventures, especially in support of China's larger goals. He dabbled in electric cars and soccer, both a passion of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Outside mainland China, Hui mixed with Hong Kong tycoons including New World Development's late founder, Cheng Yu Tung, and Chinese Estates Holdings' former chairman, Joseph Lau. 
With them, he became a core member of the ""poker club"", a tight-knit circle of tycoons who played cards and who often did investment deals together, according to three people familiar with the club. 
""He was very composed when he was first brought to the club. He knowingly lost a lot of money in the games and gained the fondness of Cheng,"" one of the people briefed by the tycoons said.
Cheng injected $150 million into Evergrande a year before its 2009 IPO in Hong Kong, helping it through a crunch during the financial crisis following aggressive expansion, according to Evergrande's listing prospectus. 
Chinese Estates has disclosed investments over the years amounting to billions of dollars in the shares and bonds of Evergrande - the largest issuer of dollar junk bonds in Asia. Chinese Estates did not respond to a request for comment.
Hui's highly leveraged businesses are worrying regulators who have warned Evergrande to get its house in order.
""He's done everything correct politically but he has also raised so much debt - in an industry the government has warned against excessive borrowing and over-speculation,"" said an analyst who declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to media.
Speaking at the 2018 China Charity Awards as a winner for the eighth consecutive year, Hui said Evergrande had paid tax totalling 185 billion yuan in the past 22 years and donated more than 10 billion yuan.
""Without the country's policy to reform higher education, I could not have left the village. Without the country giving me a scholarship of 14 yuan every month, I could not have completed university,"" Hui said.

""Without the country's good policy to reform and open up, Evergrande would not have what it has today. Therefore, everything that Evergrande and I have, they are all given by the Party, by the country, and by society.""

271,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China is unlikely to approve Baidu's $3.6 billion purchase of JOYY's YY Live -sources,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's antitrust regulator is unlikely to approve Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)'s $3.6 billion acquisition of JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) Inc's video-based domestic live streaming business YY Live, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
This follows Beijing's move to rein in gaming-related businesses and corporate expansion via deals, they said.
The Baidu-JOYY deal would be the latest multi-billion dollar transaction to stumble amid China's broad crackdown on private companies, notably those in the internet sector, as Beijing seeks to control big data and break down monopolistic practices.
A failure of the Baidu deal could cast a shadow over a separate planned transaction to take Nasdaq-listed JOYY private that would have valued it at up to $8 billion, said the sources and two other sources who are familiar with the matter.
Chinese search engine giant Baidu announced in November it would buy YY Live from social media firm JOYY, paying cash to help diversify revenue sources.
When contacted by Reuters, Baidu said it had not received messages from Chinese regulators that the deal was unlikely to be approved. 
The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) - China's antitrust regulator - and JOYY did not respond to requests for comments.
The deal has been awaiting SAMR approval to reach a final close. JOYY was to receive the remaining proceeds of about $1.6 billion from Baidu after the regulatory approval.
SAMR said in a report in early September that it is conducting anti-monopoly reviews of 11 transactions including Baidu's acquisition of YY Live. 
But one of the sources, who is familiar with the regulator's thinking, said SAMR was unlikely to give the green light because allowing Baidu to acquire and further invest in a video game-related live streaming business amid the recent crackdown on the gaming industry could send the wrong message to the market.
Another source, who was also familiar with the situation, said SAMR had already indicated to at least one of the deal parties its stance and added that the approval process will likely keep dragging on until the application lapses. 
""SAMR hopes the companies can withdraw the application,"" the source said.
SCRUTINY ON VIDEO GAMING 
Beijing has expressed its concern over the influence video games have over the country's minors and last month introduced new rules that limit the amount of time under-18s can spend on video games. 
It has also criticised the entertainment industry for ""polluting"" society and youth and recently published new guidelines for how artists and livestreamers should behave.
Two months ago, SAMR formally blocked Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY)' $5.3 billion plan to merge the country's top two videogame streaming sites Hula and DouYu on antitrust grounds. 
A failure of the Baidu-JOYY deal would be a blow to JOYY's top two shareholders, Chairman David Li and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) founder Lei Jun, as the dynamics of their plan to take JOYY private would change completely, according to the sources. 
They were teaming up for the deal as they believe the Chinese social media company is undervalued in the U.S. market, Reuters reported last month. 
Li did not respond to a request for comment made via JOYY. Lei did not respond to a request for comment either.
Founded in 2005, JOYY went public in 2012. It also runs Singapore-based live streaming platform Bigo Live and owns a 16% stake in Huya (NYSE:HUYA).

YY Live largely counts on games and entertainment content for its revenue and user traffic. Its average mobile monthly active users reached 42 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 1.9% year-on-year, according to the parent's 2020 annual report.
However, its paying users dropped by 1.1% over the same period, which JOYY attributed to the impact of COVID-19 on people's spending.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Daimler's Mercedes-Benz said on Friday it will take a 33% stake in battery cell manufacturer Automotive Cells Company (ACC), expanding its European sourcing of battery cells key to its EV ambitions and currently produced primarily in Asia.
ACC, founded in 2020 by France's Stellantis and TotalEnergies, will begin supplying Mercedes-Benz with batteries from its production locations in France and Germany from the middle of the decade.
""Our focus is on Europe,"" Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Chief Executive Ola Kallenius told a press conference. ""That is where ACC wants to grow, expand, and develop technologies with us.""
Daimler, which plans on making exclusively electric vehicles in 2030 if market conditions allow, will invest up to a billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the battery venture starting with a mid-three-digit-million cash investment next year, the company said.
ACC, which had previously planned for 48 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of capacity at its two plants, now aims to reach at least 120 GWh by 2030, it said on Friday, a goal which will require seven billion euros in equity, debt and subsidies.
Daimler board member Markus Schaefer declined to specify what proportion of ACC's desired capacity would be allocated to Daimler, stating only that it was ""absolutely significant"".
The luxury carmaker, whose previous CEO deemed producing battery cells in-house too costly, has taken a strategic turn under Kallenius towards aiming for more control over its battery supply chain, announcing its goal in July of building eight gigafactories with 200 GWh of capacity.
ACC already has ties to Germany: a 2 billion euro investment in a battery cell plant in Kaiserslautern, due to start production in 2025. 
The company plans on expanding its European network, but specific locations have not yet been determined, ACC told Reuters. 
Daimler, which said in July that four of the eight gigafactories would be in Europe and one in the United States, is in discussion with potential partners in both regions about further investments. 
""Everyone talked to us, everyone wants to do business with us,"" Kallenius said, adding that the company planned on building all its cell factories through joint ventures.
""There are no concrete plans to make our own 'Daimler-only' factories,"" Kallenius said.
Daimler currently relies on Asian partners such as CATL, SK Innovation and LG Chem for its battery supply, and took a 3% stake in Chinese-American supplier Farasis last year. 
CATL and Farasis are building battery factories in Germany, but production is not due to start until 2022 and 2024 respectively.

Daimler added that the battery cells produced by ACC would be 95% recyclable as per its goal of a CO2-neutral supply chain by 2039.

The Canadian model, one of the biggest figures on runways and magazine covers in the 1990s, said in an Instagram post that she had undergone treatment to reduce fat some five years ago.
""To my followers who have wondered why I have not been working while my peers’ careers have been thriving, the reason is that I was brutally disfigured by Zeltiq’s CoolSculpting procedure which did the opposite of what it promised,” she wrote in the posting on Wednesday.
She said she suffered a rare side effect called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH) after the procedures, which causes people to develop a swelling in the areas that were treated.
“PAH has not only destroyed my livelihood, it has sent me into a cycle of deep depression, profound sadness, and the lowest depths of self-loathing. In the process, I have become a recluse,” she said.
Zeltiq Aesthetics, a unit of Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Aesthetics and parent company AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), did not return a call for comment.
Evangelista filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in New York federal court against Zeltiq for negligence, misleading advertising and alleging that the company failed to warn customers of the possible side effects.

The lawsuit says Evangelista underwent multiple procedures between 2015 and 2016 to reduce fat on her thighs, abdomen, back, flanks and chin. Corrective surgery had not worked to fix the PAH. 
She is seeking $50 million in damages for lost income and emotional distress, saying she was now unemployable as a model and has not earned anything from modeling since 2016.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google accused India's antitrust regulator in court on Friday of being a ""habitual offender"" by leaking confidential information of cases it was examining, an accusation the watchdog rejected.
The Times of India and Reuters reported on Saturday that an investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had found that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, using its ""huge financial muscle"" illegally to hurt competitors.
In an unusual move on Thursday, Google sued the CCI in the Delhi High Court, saying in a statement it was ""protesting against the breach of confidence"" and ""to prevent any further unlawful disclosures of confidential findings"".
In Friday's near hour-long court showdown, Google's lawyer, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, accused the CCI of leaking information repeatedly, saying it did so to ""give a dog a bad name in advance and then hang him by these selective leakages"".
He asked the court to tell the CCI ""leakage cannot continue for one minute more"".
CCI's lawyer, India's Additional Solicitor General N. Venkataraman, denied the allegations, countering that the U.S. tech giant was trying to frustrate the investigative process and was challenging a government authority without evidence. 
""An accusation is made against a government body. Not a word in this whole affidavit showing how we have done it and where is the proof,"" said Venkataraman, asking for Google's filing to be dismissed. ""How are we responsible for whatever has been said in this court?""
Justice Rekha Palli noted the submissions of both sides in an order and scheduled another hearing for Monday.
Google declined to comment after the hearing, while the CCI did not immediate respond to a request for comment.
The antitrust authority ordered the probe in 2019, saying Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers' ability to opt for alternate versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps.

The probe found that the mandatory pre-installation of apps ""amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers"" in violation of India's competition law, according to the 750-page report, which is not public.
The report, seen by Reuters, also found the company leveraged the position of its Play Store app store to protect its dominance.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - As fears of contagion from any default by China Evergrande Group mounted this month, some Chinese banks, insurers, and shadow banks stopped offering new credit to property developers, and ran urgent checks on their exposure to the troubled sector.
Carrying $305 billion in liabilities, China's second biggest property developer inched closer to a potential default on Friday by missing the deadline on an interest payment.
Evergrande's problems will pile pressure on peers to access funding, and analysts have warned that if property developers are unable to pay investors, suppliers and lenders China's financial system could go into shock.
""The market is worried that real estate companies have a high concentration of cashflow problems, which would trigger large-scale bad debt risks in the banking system,"" said Wang Yifeng, analyst from Everbright Securities Co.
Bank of China, the country's fourth largest lender by assets, is monitoring closely all its developer clients, to prevent contagion risks, said a person with knowledge of the matter.
""The expectation is that not only Evergrande, but also some of the top leveraged developers are on edge of liquidity crash even insolvency,"" said a person at the Bank of Shanghai Co Ltd.
To calm the market and in an unusual move, Chinese lenders including China Minsheng Bank, China Zheshang Bank and China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank have been publicly reassuring and voluntarily disclosing their exposure to Evergrande and the property sector.
But internally, financiers are scrambling to reduce their exposure to ""non-quality property assets"", bracing for a sharp deterioration in the financial health of some developers.
CREDIT STRESS
Alarmed by what has happened to Evergrande, bankers at one Shanghai branch of China CITIC Bank Corp started scrutinizing loans to developers, reviewing their accounts and repayment terms, said a person with direct knowledge.
CITIC Bank said it was fully prepared for the possible risks raised by Evergrande, had increased loan loss provisions and risk resistance.
Once China's top-selling developer, Evergrande now looms as a seismic bust as a crackdown on debt ends a freewheeling era of building with borrowed money which became infamous for ghost cities.
Having taken the precaution of tightening credit for Evergrande a few years ago, Huarong Asset Management Co has in the past couple of weeks tightened the approval process for other developers, making it harder for them to raise money for projects in lower tier cities.
""Now, fourth-tier cities are completely out, third-tier cities are very difficult to get approvals for. So it's tighter than it was before,"" said an official at Huarong.
To reduce its overall lending to the sector, AEON Life, China's fifth largest insurer, has raised the bar for private developers' to obtain funds, according to an official there, which can be done, for example, by setting a higher collateral to loan rate. 
Huarong AMC, AEON Life did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Chinese banks, insurers and bond funds have provided large scale funding to the property sector in recent years, and their exposure is among the more significant risks facing the financial system, Scope research said on Thursday.

Property loans accounted for nearly 30% of total outstanding loans of Chinese financial institutions at the end of September 2020, as per data from the People's Bank of China.
Fitch Ratings said in a report on Friday that many of the smaller mid-tier Chinese banks are expected to face ""greater asset-quality headwinds"" as the property sector suffers an increase in the credit stresses that were highlighted by Evergrande.

By 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) stock was down 3.6% and Puma stock was down 2.9%. U.K. sports retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (LON:JD) also fell in sympathy, by 2.3%. By comparison, the DAX index was down 0.8% and the FTSE 100 was down 0.3%
Nike on Thursday had cut its sales guidance for both the current quarter and the year, a reflection of prolonged factory closures in Vietnam due to Covid-19. Around half of Nike footwear is made in the southeast Asian country. Nike also warned of shipping delays that could affect its performance during the holiday season. 
As with Nike, Adidas has shifted much of its production of sneakers and soccer kleets to Vietnam from China over the last decade. The German company already warned in August that it would suffer 500 million euros in lost sales due to factory closures. However, that didn't stop it raising its full-year guidance for revenue. It expects sales to be up 20% this year, riding a sustained wave of demand for leisure and athletic wear as more people adapt their wardrobes to reflect the greater time spent at home due to social distancing.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 04:30AM ET</span>",Japan's SBI to extend offer for Shinsei by a month on some conditions,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings said on Friday it would extend the deadline for its $1.1 billion unsolicited tender offer for Shinsei Bank to Nov. 24 from Oct. 25 if Shinsei agreed to meet certain conditions.
SBI, which owns Japan's largest online brokerage, operates an online bank and has stakes in multiple regional banks. It is planning to increase its stake in Shinsei to as much as 48% from 20% to take effective control of the lender.
Struggling to find ways to thwart the takeover, Shinsei said https://www.reuters.com/business/shinsei-bank-plans-poison-pill-defence-against-sbis-11-bln-bid-sources-2021-09-17 last week if its board decided that SBI's bid would damage its corporate value, it would seek shareholder approval on an undecided date to issue stock warrants to existing shareholders, a measure that would dilute SBI's stake.
It was also requesting a deadline extension for the tender offer to Dec. 8.
In a letter that was released publicly responding to Shinsei's request for an extension, SBI cited four conditions that needed to be met, including that the Shinsei board explain specific grounds as to why SBI's bid could damage corporate value.
SBI also demanded Shinsei hold a shareholder meeting by Nov. 17 to seek approval for its planned poison-pill defence against SBI's bid. It would extend the deadline if Shinsei failed to win the majority approval required for the defence measure, it said.
SBI is considering what to do if the measure is approved by shareholders, a company spokesperson added.
Separately on Friday, Shinsei said it would temporarily suspend buybacks of its shares worth up to 20 billion yen ($181 million) as SBI's tender offer had changed the pricing process of the shares.

Shinsei may restart buybacks after a termination or withdrawal of the tender offer, it said.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",Explainer-How China Evergrande's debt troubles pose a systemic risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group has missed a dollar bond interest payment deadline, moving closer to a potential default and fuelling worries about a collapse that could send shockwaves through China's economy and beyond.
WHAT IS EVERGRANDE?
Chairman Hui Ka Yan founded Evergrande in Guangzhou in 1996. It is China's second-largest property developer with $110 billion in sales last year, $355 billion in assets, and over 1,300 developments nationwide. It listed in Hong Kong in 2009.
Evergrande grew rapidly through a loan-supported land-buying spree and selling apartments quickly at low margins. It has 200,000 staff and hires 3.8 million annually for developments.
Slowing growth has seen it branch into businesses such as insurance, bottled water, football and electric vehicles (EVs).
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT?
In September last year, a leaked letter showed Evergrande pleading for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor stock market listing. Sources told Reuters the letter was authentic; Evergrande called it fake.
In June, Evergrande said it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and in July a court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm at the bank's request.
The firm in late August said construction at some of its developments had halted due to missed payments to contractors and suppliers. Sources have told Reuters that it also missed payments to bank and trust loans in the past few weeks.
Liabilities, including payables, total 1.97 trillion yuan ($306.3 billion) - about 2% of China's gross domestic product. 
HOW HAS EVERGRANDE REDUCED DEBT?
Evergrande accelerated efforts to cut debt last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios, dubbed the ""three red lines"". It aims to meet requirements by 2022-end.
It offered steep discounts on residential developments to spur sales and sold the bulk of its commercial properties. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale, raised $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit, and saw its EV unit sell a $3.4 billion stake.
On Sept. 14, it said asset and equity disposal plans had failed to make material progress.
WHAT'S THE RISK?
The central bank in 2018 said companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risk to China's financial system.
The firm's liabilities involved as many as 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions, the leaked letter showed.
Late repayments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions are exposed via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
In the U.S. dollar bond market, Evergrande accounts for 4% of Chinese real estate high-yielding debt, data from Singapore bank DBS showed. A default could further trigger a sell-off across high-yield credit markets.
WHAT ABOUT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA?
In Hong Kong, Evergrande owns an office tower and residential development as well as two nearly completed residential developments, plus a vast undeveloped land parcel.
It has spent billions of dollars acquiring stakes in automobile technology developers, including Sweden's NEVS, the Netherlands' e-Traction and Britain's Protean. It also has joint ventures with Germany's Hofer and Sweden's Koenigsegg.
WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?

The central bank and banking regulator in August ordered Evergrande to reduce debt risk.
Regulators have approved an Evergrande proposal to renegotiate payment deadlines with banks and other creditors, media reported. Guangzhou government is also seeking major lenders' opinions about establishing a creditor committee.

The U.S. pension fund held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of Reliance Industries, as of June 30, 2020, according to the last available disclosure on its website.
CalSTRS' voting decision is based on U.S. proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis' recommendation, BloombergQuint reported on Friday.
Reliance, owned by billionaire Ambani, had appointed Aramco's Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on July 19 in the process of formalising a deal it had struck with the Saudi Arabian company to sell 20% stake in its oil-to-chemicals business.
The shareholders' voting process to confirm Al-Rumayyan's appointment as independent director, for a period of three years, will end on Oct. 19.
Glass Lewis, which makes voting recommendations to more than 1,200 investors across the world, had recommended voting against Al-Rumayyan ""based on the director's status as an independent director"" of RIL, the report added.
Reliance, CalSTRS and Glass Lewis did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for a comment. 
The Indian conglomerate had announced the sale for $15 billion in 2019 to Aramco, the world's top oil exporting firm, though the deal was stalled after the coronavirus crisis dented oil prices and fuel demand. 

Last month, Bloomberg News reported that an agreement between Reliance and Aramco could be reached in the coming weeks. At Aramco's earnings briefing in August, Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser had said the company was still doing due diligence on the Reliance deal.
Al-Rumayyan is the chairman of Aramco's Board of Directors and has been the governor of the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia since 2015.

284,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 02:36AM ET</span>","Stocks Up, Futures Steady in Europe; Sovereign Yields Higher","(Bloomberg) -- Stocks and sovereign bond yields climbed Friday on optimism about the economic outlook, though uncertainty lingers about potential risks from the debt crisis at China Evergrande Group.
MSCI Inc.’s Asia-Pacific index rose for a second day, led by Japan. Shares were muted in Hong Kong and China, where Evergrande has yet to make a statement on a dollar-bond interest payment that was due Thursday. Global market unease about contagion from Evergrande has ebbed, but it remains unclear if Beijing will manage the fallout from any potential default at the word’s most-indebted developer.
U.S and European futures were little changed after the S&P 500’s biggest two-day gain since July. The Wall Street advance was led by economically-sensitive sectors like energy and financials, as investors embraced the view that a looming reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus shows confidence in the recovery from the pandemic. The dollar ticked up. Oil was above $73 a barrel.
The prospect of tighter monetary policy spurred a global selloff in bonds. Long-term Treasury yields have surged the most in 18 months as traders brought forward expectations for the first Fed rate hike to the end of 2022. Yields jumped on sovereign debt in Australia and New Zealand. 
Equity investors are taking heart from predictions that the delta virus strain and pandemic-related supply-chain snarls will deal only a temporary setback to economic reopening. Central banks have also pledged to withdraw stimulus gradually. But a continuing rise in long-term borrowing costs could be a risk to the upbeat picture if it ends up denting confidence in recovery prospects.
Clarity from the Fed has allowed risk assets to flourish, Elaine Stokes, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co., told Bloomberg Television, adding that “what they did is tell us that they feel really good about the economy.”
While the bond selloff has vindicated Treasury bears who argue yields are too low to reflect fundamentals, others see limits to how high they can go. 
“We’d expected bond yields to go higher, given the macro situation where growth is still very strong,” Sylvia Sheng, global multi-asset strategist with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “But we do stress that is a modest view, because we think that upside to yields is still limited from here given that central banks including the Fed are still buying bonds.”

285,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 02:26AM ET</span>","Analysis-For Xi and China Evergrande, a delicate balancing act","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group poses a $305 billion conundrum for President Xi Jinping: how to impose financial discipline without fuelling social unrest.
With one year before the Chinese president is poised to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, the stakes are high during what is proving to be the most consequential period of his tenure.
Evergrande's borrow-to-build model was enabled by a government reliant on property sales for revenue and unwilling to bite the bullet on runaway indebtedness for fear a collapse in prices would have devastating consequences for a country in which property accounts for 40% of household wealth, analysts, academics and economists say.
Xi, who has unleashed a spate of industry and societal reforms this year in the name of ""common prosperity https://www.reuters.com/world/china/unleashing-reforms-xi-returns-chinas-socialist-roots-2021-09-09"", has made clear that the excesses of decades of breakneck growth powered by a relentless rise in property prices and debt must be brought to heel. 
But shared responsibility for Evergrande's crisis - and worries about the repercussions of a messy collapse - complicate decisions on the fate of a conglomerate with $305 billion in debt that is scrambling to pay creditors, including bondholders owed $83 million in a coupon payment https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-bondholders-limbo-over-debt-resolution-2021-09-24 that was due on Thursday. 
""The government has to some degree caused the problems at Evergrande,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director at Orient Capital Research, citing debt ratio caps, known as the ""three red lines"", placed on developers in 2020 that put Evergrande under significant stress and forced it to start to sell assets.
Those caps followed renewed official concern last year over property sector froth after monetary easing to cushion the impact of COVID-19 drove surging sales and signs of speculative overbuilding by developers.
But clamping down on property prices is difficult given the fiscal dependence on the sector. Local governments, which Orient Capital estimates account for 89% of total government spending, derived more than 40% of revenues from land sales in 2020, driving a codependent relationship with developers.
""(Developers) seem to get caught up in the political economy ... which effectively leads to a tremendous number of bad decisions because you're now making investments based on political whim and political winds, rather than actual sound business sense,"" said Fraser Howie, author of several books about China's financial system.
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment.
DEEP ROOTS
The roots of the crisis date to tax reforms in 1994, which bolstered central government coffers but left local governments reliant on land financing for revenue, said Alfred Wu, associate professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. 
That triggered a rise in property prices and the growth of developers like Evergrande, which thrived in third- and fourth-tier cities.
""Evergrande is a cash cow for regional governments. If the company goes bust, the model of land-financing and regional governments will go bust, too. The central government won't allow that,"" Wu said.
Despite years of warnings from some quarters about the business model used by Evergrande and others, which has included taking on heavy debt to spur land and project acquisitions, the company was hardly a rogue operator.
Chairman and majority shareholder Hui Ka Yan https://www.reuters.com/world/china/evergrandes-billionaire-boss-exudes-calm-debt-risks-grow-2021-09-01 took pains to show off his close alliance with Beijing and the ruling Communist Party, and was reciprocated.
Included in a list of Hui's achievements in Evergrande's 2020 annual report are being named a ""national model worker"", an award-winning poverty fighter and an ""Excellent Builder for the Socialist Cause with Chinese Characteristics"".
GREAT AWAKENING
Stability-obsessed Beijing is well aware that the rise in the housing market created not only great wealth but deep inequality.
One portfolio manager based outside China who declined to be identified said the 2019 anti-government protests in Hong Kong, blamed partly on inequality fuelled by sky-high housing costs, were a wake-up call for Beijing. 
This year, Xi has set out to reform the ""three huge mountains"" https://www.reuters.com/world/china/no-gain-without-pain-why-chinas-reform-push-must-hurt-investors-2021-07-28 of housing, education and healthcare to rein in soaring costs for city dwellers as a way to shore up legitimacy as the ""people's leader"", analysts said.
Protests by disgruntled suppliers, home buyers and investors last week illustrated discontent that could spiral in the event a default sparks crises at other developers.
UBS estimated there are 10 developers with potentially risky positions accounting for combined contract sales of 1.86 trillion yuan ($287.92 billion), nearly three times Evergrande's total.
Still, many analysts say a wider crisis is unlikely, predicting that authorities would choose a route of squeezing the overall property sector while addressing individual problems as they arise. 

""The government knows that if it doesn't handle Evergrande carefully and lets it go bankrupt, disgruntled homeowners and shareholders could cause social instability, loan defaults could lead to financial risk, massive layoffs could add to employment woes, and private firms could be further spooked,"" said Tang Renwu, who heads the School of Public Administration at Beijing Normal University.

The sale comes less than a year after the investment in December last year, as Chinese authorities mount an anti-trust crackdown on large tech companies.
One major target has been Alibaba, which faced a fine of $2.75 billion over anti-competitive practices.
In Thursday's filing to the stock exchange, the media company said Alibaba's investment arm would seek a waiver from a one-year lockup to which it committed at the time of its investment.
Since then, shares of Mango Excellent Media have fallen roughly 40%. The firm, based in China's western province of Hunan, produces Internet and television content besides running a shopping division.
Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.
Alibaba's stock price has fallen by nearly half since last October, when authorities abruptly halted plans for its financial affiliate, Ant Group, to go public.
Mango Excellent Media is one of several media-related investments funded by Alibaba, which is a major shareholder in Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp, China's social media equivalent of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
It also wholly owns the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's top English-language newspaper.

In July Reuters reported that Weibo was in talks to go private with the help of a Shanghai-based state-owned company, in an effort to help Alibaba divest. After the report, the firm's chairman, Charles Chao, said he had no such discussions.
In addition to Weibo, Alibaba owns stakes in some small Chinese online media and has its own filmaking division, Alibaba Pictures.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc launched in India on Friday eight global and local streaming services on its video platform, in a move aimed at boosting subscriptions.
The move comes at a time of increasing competition from global and domestic rivals in an important market for the U.S. tech company.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Channels service will help customers using its Prime flagship loyalty programme to subscribe to multiple streaming services on a single interface, Gaurav Gandhi, the head of Amazon Prime Video in India, told Reuters in an interview ahead of the launch.
""We believe besides solving customer problems... multiple apps, multiple log ins... it also solves a lot for our partners where they are able to get the benefit of Prime Video's reach and ubiquitous distribution,"" said Gandhi.
Channels is launching with streaming services from partners including Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and Mubi, said Gandhi, adding that India is the 12th country where it is being launched.
Gandhi declined to talk about specifics of revenue sharing with content partners or discuss other financial parameters of the service.
Prime customers will still have to pay individually for subscribing to each streaming service, although they are currently being offered at a discounted price.
For example, movie streaming app Mubi costs 499 rupees ($6.77) a month in India but on Prime Video the subscription is priced at an annual 1,999 rupees.
""Amazon's power as an aggregator of content and as a destination improves,"" said Uday Sodhi, the former head of  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp's digital business in India.
""This is great for Amazon because they will understand consumer behaviour even better... from the consumption of other apps. And all of this will help them increase their business significantly.""
India, the world's second-most populous nation with 1.3 billion people, is a vital growth market for Amazon and its global rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS). 
Prime Video's rival Disney+ Hotstar hosts Bollywood movies, TV shows and live streams India's popular cricket league matches, while Netflix has bet big on local original content. An announced merger of India's Zee and a local unit of Japan's Sony Group Corp is also set to create a TV powerhouse that will challenge Prime Video and others in the market.

Amazon has invested heavily in acquiring and producing local content in India and its founder Jeff Bezos said last year that Prime Video was doing well globally ""but nowhere it's doing better than India"". Amazon does not break out user numbers by country.

291,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 12:36AM ET</span>","World-Beating Rally Pushes India’s Sensex to Record 60,000","(Bloomberg) -- India’s main stock indexes surged to unprecedented levels on optimism that speedier vaccinations will improve demand for businesses in Asia’s third-largest economy, even as concerns mount over whether valuations have become too rich.
The S&P BSE Sensex topped the 60,000-level for the first time on Friday and the Nifty 50 Index neared the 18,000-mark. The Sensex has more than doubled from its pandemic lows hit March 2020, to become one of the best performers among major markets. 
The world-beating stock rally is fueled by millions of first-time investors, willing to buy riskier assets as the central bank’s record-low policy rates reduce returns from traditional saving avenues like bank deposits. Global funds are riding the wave, having poured nearly $9 billion into Indian stocks, set for a third straight year of net inflows. That compares with outflows from countries like South Korea and Malaysia.
“Investors have to be a little selective now,” said Gurmeet Chadha, who co-founded wealth management firm Complete Circle Consultants Pvt. With key equity gauges trading above their long-term averages and Indian stocks’ valuation reaching 1.3 times the country’s GDP, “clearly some caution is warranted,” he added.
Bulls point to an easing pandemic that could fuel even greater gains. New infections in India have held steady since about July, with the bulk of cases coming from just two states. The pace of vaccinations has picked up, with almost 45% of people in the world’s second-most-populous country having received at least one dose and 15% fully vaccinated. 
Most states have lifted lockdown curbs, improving prospects for businesses’ demand and profits ahead of the key festival season starting next month. Earnings for India’s top 50 companies are estimated to rise 27% in the current financial year.
More cautious investors note that the Nifty is trading at close to 23 times its estimated 12-month earnings, well above its five-year average of about 18 times, and much higher than the MSCI Emerging Market Index’s multiple of 13. 
Risks are also rising for the economy; a retreat for the Nifty 50 Index would reduce gross domestic product by 1.4% in the same quarter of the shock and by 3.8% over the following year, Ankur Shukla, an economist with Bloomberg Economics, wrote in a recent note. 
UBS Group AG’s wealth management arm is downgrading Indian equities to neutral from most preferred as “the country’s fast macro and earnings recoveries are largely priced into the market’s very rich valuation,” Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation, wrote in a report. 
The markets may face a test as early as next month if the Reserve Bank of India is hawkish in its statements or actions following a monetary policy review. Traders are seeing hints that the authority is seeking to drain record liquidity from the banking system, another sign that the global flood of pandemic-era easy money may begin to ease. 
“At such valuations, earnings delivery becomes crucial,” said Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. “I would suggest investors be cautious now on small-and-mid caps.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House pressed automakers, chip companies and others on Thursday to provide information on the ongoing semiconductor crisis that has forced cuts to U.S. auto production, and to take the lead in helping solve it.
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who along with Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, met on Thursday with semiconductor industry participants, told Reuters that strong action was needed. ""It's time to get more aggressive,"" she said. ""The situation is not getting better; in some ways it is getting worse.""
Participants in Thursday's meeting, which followed meetings in April and May, included Detroit's Big Three automakers, plus Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), BMW, GlobalFoundries, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (KS:005930), TSMC, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ampere Computing.
The White House said the administration ""reaffirmed that industry needs to be in the lead in resolving the supply chain bottlenecks that are occurring due to the global chip shortage.""
Raimondo said a voluntary request on Thursday for information within 45 days on the chips crisis would boost supply chain transparency and ""get more granular into the bottlenecks and then ultimately predict challenges before they happen.""
She warned that if companies did not answer the voluntary request ""then we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give us data. I hope we don't get there. But if we have to we will.""
Automakers from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to Chrysler parent Stellantis NV have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who participated in the White House virtual meeting, said the automaker will cooperate with the information request, but added in a statement that ""broad participation from the entire semiconductor supply chain will be critical for these efforts to be successful.""
TSMC said in a statement after the meeting that the company was supporting and working with all stakeholders to overcome the shortages, and that the it had taken ""unprecedented actions to address this challenge"".
""We are confident that our capacity expansion plan including the advanced 5nm semiconductor fab in Phoenix, Arizona - one of the largest foreign direct investments in U.S. history - will enable us to support the industry in driving long-term stability in semiconductor supplies,"" it said.
TSMC has pledged to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand chip capacity amid the global shortage. 
Some attendees told Reuters privately they were concerned the transparency measures could require disclosing pricing information that many companies regard as corporate secrets.
Raimondo also delivered the message to the companies privately that the government would mandate information sharing if necessary.

The White House also said several U.S. agencies would manage a new early alert system ""to proactively manage potential semiconductor supply chain disruptions linked to public health developments in key trading partners.""
Participants were concerned about how to disclose such information while still complying with reporting requirements of publicly traded companies, a participant said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s executives ranks remained largely white, although the share of non-white executives rose modestly, while minorities continued to account for most of its blue-collar workforce as the online retailer grew rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new company data.
The disclosure made Amazon the largest company by market capitalization to date to respond to a call from New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer for companies to publicly release a confidential federal form, his office said on Thursday.
In all 67 companies in the S&P 100 released or plan to release their EEO-1 forms, which show detailed worker information as a result of the campaign, Stringer's office said.
A lack of racial or gender diversity in the leadership of many U.S. corporations has drawn focus since last year's Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
Demographic trends at Amazon are closely-watched compared to other technology companies partly because of the big blue-collar workforce staffing its warehouses and delivery vans, making it one of the largest U.S. private employers.
Amazon's data on U.S. workers showed that as of the end of October last year, 71% of top executives were white, down from 74% at the same point in 2019. 
The figures were in a similar range as other big technology companies, several of which have not yet disclosed 2020 reports. An Amazon spokeswoman said via e-mail the data shows it is making progress on diversity and noted hiring goals it has set to improve diversity, including hiring more Black people and women. People of color accounted for 42% of newly-hired executives in 2020, she said. 
Amazon's total U.S. employment now stands around 950,000, and the company has described more hiring goals.

In the filings Amazon posted on its website on Wednesday the biggest single category of workers was ""laborers and helpers,"" accounting for about two-thirds of workers as of last October. 
The form showed such workers who were Black, Hispanic or in other nonwhite categories made up 74% of such workers last year, compared with 72% the prior year.

The insurer, which will list through an initial public offering (IPO), posted revenue of $9.49 billion last year. FWD also said its net loss applicable to shareholders narrowed to $243 million in the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, compared with a $278 million loss a year earlier. 
The company had confidentially filed for the listing in June. FWD has not yet set the terms for its IPO, but Reuters had reported it could raise $2 billion to $3 billion, valuing the company at $13 billion to $15 billion.
Richard Li is the son of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-Shing. FWD's foundation was laid in 2012 with the acquisition of ING's Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand units for $2.1 billion, and it has since continued this bolt-on approach.
Major acquisitions include the $3 billion purchase of Siam Commercial Bank (OTC:SMUUY) PCL's life insurance unit in Thailand in 2019, just days after agreeing to buy the Hong Kong operations of U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET).
There has been indicative interest in up to $500 million of the stock to be sold in the IPO, according to the filings.
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has indicated it could buy up to $300 million worth of stock, while Richard Li's PCCW Ltd could take $100 million, the filings showed.
FWD's controlling shareholder, Pacific Century Group - another Richard Li firm - has also flagged its interest to invest $100 million.

The indicative orders account for nearly one quarter of the IPO at the lower end of the proposed raising range.
FWD also said it would raise $400 million from Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc in a private placement as part of a new asset and investment management agreement.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, as concerns about the impact from China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) financial woes still linger.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.17% by 9:57 PM ET (1:57 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.20%. Although investors breathed a sigh of relief as concerns over China Evergrande’s debt woes receded somewhat, it remains unclear if and how the developer will pay the more than $300 billion of liabilities that it owes. It also remains unclear how authorities will react to any potential default.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.64%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.73% after returning from a holiday. Data released earlier in the day said that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0% year-on-year in August. The national CPI contracted 0.4% year-on-year and 0.2% month-on-month respectively.
The data also showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for September was 51.2.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.04% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.11%.
Investors were also optimistic that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to start hiking interest rates in 2022 was a sign of confidence in the economic recovery from COVID-19. The central bank handed down its latest policy decision on Wednesday.
Clarity from the Fed has allowed risk assets to flourish, Loomis Sayles & Co. portfolio manager Elaine Stokes told Bloomberg.
“What they did is tell us that they feel really good about the economy.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Governor Michelle Bowman and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida are due to discuss the economic recovery from COVID-19 later in the day.
On the data front, inflation data released on Thursday was lower than expected. September’s U.S. manufacturing PMI was 60.5 and the Markit composite PMI was 54.5. The services PMI was 54.4.
However, should inflationary pressures continue, it will pose a risk to investors’ optimism if it reduces confidence in this economic recovery.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England (BOE) kept its interest rate unchanged at 0.10% as it handed down its policy decision on Thursday. BOE did keep the possibility of an interest rate hike in 2021 open, which pushed down 10-year gilts."

In a letter to a parliamentary committee that issued a report in July related to Greensill's collapse, released on Friday by the same committee, Sunak said he had accepted its call for reform of the mechanism used by Greensill, known as the ""appointed representatives regime"".
Sunak said in the letter, first reported by the Financial Times, that the Treasury had already started to review the regime, including legislative reforms to strengthen the oversight of appointed representatives to prevent opportunities for abuse of the system.
Regarding reforms of the regulatory regime surrounding changes of control of banks, Sunak said the Treasury is working with the Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to consider how change of control applications are dealt with, and what changes might need to be considered.
Earlier this month, financial regulators said trade finance firms must do more to identify potentially suspicious activities undertaking additional risk assessments.
Greensill Capital's collapse earlier this year highlighted risks in the $1.3 trillion supply chain finance business.
The parliamentary committee in July said former British Prime Minister David Cameron showed a lack of judgment in using personal contacts and informal channels to lobby for the now-collapsed Greensill Capital.

The committee did not call for making supply chain finance in general a regulated activity, but said the appointed representatives regime should be tightened up to reduce ""opportunities for abuse"".
In May, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was formally investigating the UK operations of Greensill as part of global probes.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 09:47PM ET</span>",Analysis-Climate and COVID cast shadow over jet demand outlook,"By Sarah Young, Conor Humphries and Tim Hepher
LONDON/TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Jetmakers see strong demand for airliners even as the industry braces for tough new environmental measures, but some financiers have raised doubts over forecasts that the $150 billion industry will return to pre-COVID growth in just a few years. 
Lessors and underwriters of securities that finance aircraft purchases met in London this week to survey COVID damage and contemplate the impact of moves to combat climate change through regulation and new technology.
Some speculated that the industry's deepest fear could come true: These trends might shorten the operational lifespan - and hurt the valuations - of even the most modern aircraft. 
If confirmed, that could upend assumptions that have made the dollar-based jet industry an investor hot spot for a decade.
BOEING FORECAST
After trimming forecasts at the height of the pandemic, Boeing (NYSE:BA) last week increased its 20-year demand forecast, citing the swift U.S. economic recovery. Once a pandemic travel slump disappears by around 2024, it said annual demand growth would resume a long-term trend of 4%-5%.
At a London conference of the leasing industry, which buys around 60% of global jet output, Boeing downplayed fears of a structural contraction of business and leisure travel. 
""With business travel, I think it's hard for me to believe that it won't be back to where it was,"" said Darren Hulst, Boeing vice president for commercial marketing.
Airbus, laying out its vision for more sustainable flying at a two-day company conference in Toulouse, was more cautious ahead of its own outlook update expected in November.
""We are still scratching our heads trying to best factor in all the things that have changed recently in the world and in our sector,"" said Chief Executive Guillaume Faury.
Climate concerns will have ""an impact, a significant impact, but the demand remains very strong and we have seen this all around the world,"" he added. 
DEMAND SCEPTICISM
But at the Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences, which both attracted just a small fraction of the 2,000 or so delegates who usually attend, many participants believed the industry would see slower growth than Boeing and some suppliers have forecast, at least in more mature markets. 
One senior aerospace executive said that COVID-19 had cost the industry five years of growth in the short term. And post-COVID, long-term growth could be slower than historical trends notably because of pressure from environmental measures. 
Some analysts agree. ""It will take a long while for people to get back to the comfort that they had in 2019 about international travel,"" said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend by Cirium, which provides data analytics to the industry. 
""I think we'd be more cautious"" than Boeing, he said.
REGULATION AND ASSET VALUES
In the background, delegates fretted whether environmental regulation and faster technological change shorten the lifespan - and undermine the valuation - of the most popular jets. 
The COVID crisis has already hit the values of Airbus and Boeing's most popular mid-life planes, the A320ceo and the 737NG, as airlines seek newer jets to save fuel in an increasingly competitive and tightly regulated market. 
That generation of jets ""might need a price reckoning,"" said Simon Clements, executive vice president at Novus Aviation Capital, referring to resale valuations that drive the sector. 
An even bigger question is whether the current generation of short-haul jets - the 737MAX and the A320neo - may face shorter service lives as urgent efforts to address climate change hasten the arrival of technology that is more sustainable. 
Any shortening of the roughly 25-year life cycle used by valuers to depreciate assets could affect future sales.
""We are getting a lot of questions about will that mean you're going to not be able to use the MAX, and the neo for 25 years?"" said Phil Seymour, president of consultancy IBA.
Already the average age of jet retirement for the industry as a whole has dipped from around 30 years in 2008 to just over 25 years last year, according to Ascend by Cirium's Rob Morris.
Leasing models now assume an aircraft retains 10% of its original value after 25 years, but that could be shortened to 20 years if valuations shrink, Seymour said. 

British low-cost airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) this month said it was reducing the assumption for the time jets stay in its fleet to 18 years from 23. But its chief executive told Reuters this was an accounting matter rather than a verdict on jet lifespans. 
Bond investors, hungry for yield, appear to be willing to accept the risks, said Marjan Riggi, managing director, Kroll bond ratings. ""Every time an aviation deal goes out there, it is snapped up just like that,"" she said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained more than 1% on Thursday as investors appeared relieved about the Federal Reserve's stance on tapering stimulus and raising interest rates. 
Upbeat outlooks from Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) helped to bolster the market, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration late Wednesday authorized a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 65 and older.
Also helping sentiment, concern about a ripple effect from China Evergrande continued to ease. 
The Fed said on Wednesday it could begin reducing its monthly bond purchases by as soon as November, and that interest rates could rise quicker than expected by next year. The November deadline was largely priced in by markets.
In a press conference after the statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the bar for lifting rates from zero is much higher than for tapering.
""This is a follow-on rally from a very good Fed meeting,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
""To me that showed there were no surprises and things were as expected,"" he said. ""Any Fed rate hike is still quite a ways off and so much can change between now and then.""
Among S&P 500 major industry sectors, energy was up 3.4% and financial stocks were up 2.5%, gaining the most ground. Real estate and utilities were the only sectors out of 11 showing losses, both off about 0.5%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 506.5 points, or 1.48%, to 34,764.82, the S&P 500 gained 53.34 points, or 1.21%, to 4,448.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 155.40 points, or 1.04%, to 15,052.24.
Shares of IT services provider Salesforce finished up 7% and the company was a big boost to the S&P and the Dow during the session after it raised its annual earnings forecast.
Accenture gained 2.5% after the IT consulting firm boosted its first-quarter outlook. 
Concerns eased further over a potential default by Chinese property developer Evergrande even as Reuters reported that some holders of the firm's dollar bonds had given up hope of getting a coupon payment by a key Thursday deadline.
Investors shrugged off data showing sluggish business activity growth and a rise in jobless claims, in line with expectations for a slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter.
During the session the S&P 500 broke above its 50-day moving average, after trading below the indicator for three full sessions - its biggest such breach since early March. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 47 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.84 billion shares, compared with the 10.07 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Thursday the Biden administration will take further action against Chinese telecoms firm Huawei if necessary, after some Republican lawmakers have pressed for more steps.
Washington says Huawei is a national security threat on a variety of grounds and aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks. Citing Huawei’s ties to the Chinese government and military, Washington says this makes the company susceptible to ""Chinese governmental pressure to participate in espionage.""
In a Reuters interview, Raimondo was asked about Huawei and recounted how she told Republican lawmakers in January ""that I wouldn’t be soft and now the proof’s in the pudding -- we haven’t been. They shouldn’t worry."" 
Former President Donald Trump's administration added Huawei to the U.S. Entity List in May 2019. Raimondo said the list ""is a really powerful tool in our toolbox, and we will use it to the fullest extent possible to protect American national security.""
She added: ""Will we do more? If we need to, yes."" 
Huawei declined to comment on Raimondo's remarks.
Huawei in November 2020 said it was selling its budget brand smartphone unit, Honor Device Co, to a consortium of over 30 agents and dealers. Last month, a group of 14 Republican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives asked the Commerce Department to add Honor to the Entity List.
The Republican lawmakers said Honor was spun off ""to evade U.S. export control policies."" The letter cited analysts saying that ""selling Honor gave it access to the semiconductor chips and software it relied on and would have presumably been blocked had the divestiture not gone through.”
Raimondo noted the Commerce Department has continued to add other companies to the Entity List.

In June, five additional Chinese companies were added after the department said they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
""We're continuing to work on our export controls,"" Raimondo said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A former Wall Street quantitative analyst was charged on Thursday with insider trading for making nearly 2,900 trades after learning his employer would soon make the same trades for clients, known as front-running.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Sergei Polevikov, 48, of Port Washington, New York, generated more than $8.5 million of illegal profit from trades he conducted from January 2014 to October 2019 through his wife's brokerage account.
Polevikov worked for OppenheimerFunds during the alleged front-running, according to a public records search.
Prosecutors said his trades were designed to take advantage of small stock price movements he expected to occur that day once his employer filled large client orders.
In a related civil complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said 2,858 of Polevikov's 2,874 overlapping trades were in the same direction as his employer's.
Polevikov was charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and investment company fraud.
Bail was set at $1.5 million at his initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Thursday afternoon. Polevikov was arrested on Wednesday night. The securities fraud and wire fraud counts each carry maximum 20-year prison terms.
Polevikov ""violated not just the terms of his employment but also the law when he exploited material, nonpublic information to make personal trades ahead of large institutional trades,"" U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said in a statement.
A lawyer for Polevikov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to his LinkedIn page, Polevikov left OppenheimerFunds in October 2019, five months after it was acquired by Invesco Ltd from MassMutual.

He is now chief executive of WellAI, a Wyoming-based health and technology company he co-founded last year.
Invesco said it cooperated with the government's probe and would provide any additional assistance the government requests. WellAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

McDonald's had suspended its $15 billion buyback program early last year as the burger chain looked to conserve cash in order to navigate through the COVID-19 health crisis that had forced many of its restaurants to close their doors to diners.

But global sales are now above pre-pandemic levels, with the company raising its guidance for fiscal 2021 in July on the hope people will continue to head out to restaurants as economies reopen.
The burger chain declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.38 per share payable on December 15, taking its fourth-quarter dividend payout to over $1 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday and stressed the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific region at a time when the United States is trying to solidify its pivot toward Asia and strengthen ties with allies to take on China's growing influence in the region.
The meeting between the most prominent Indian American and the Indian Prime Minister, who has close ties with former President Donald Trump, assumed greater significance as the Biden administration takes steps to deepen its relationship with one its most important allies in Asia.
""The United States, like India, feels very strongly about the pride of being a member of the Indo Pacific, but also the fragility and importance...of those relationships, including maintaining a free and open Indo Pacific,"" Harris told Modi during the meeting.
The meeting was also a celebratory moment for the 4 million strong Indian diaspora in the United States and Indians back home who take pride in Harris's Indian roots and her ascent. 
Modi praised the vice president referring to her as an ""inspiration,"" a leader who is like ""family"" and called her a ""real friend"" who has had India's back during the COVID-19 crisis.
""The oldest democracy and the largest democracy...we are indeed natural partners, we have similar values,"" Modi said. 
During the meeting, Harris also welcomed India's decision to resume exports of the COVID-19 vaccine and said both countries must work together to protect democracies around the world.
India, the world's biggest maker of COVID vaccines, announced recently that it would resume vaccine exports later this year. India stopped exports in April to focus on inoculating its own population as infections exploded.
""When India experienced the surge of COVID in the country, the United States was very proud to support India in its need and responsibility to vaccinate its people, and I welcome India's announcement that it will soon be able to resume vaccine exports,"" Harris said. 
Harris and Modi were expected to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, greater cooperation in technology, space and other sectors, and supply chain issues, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
Modi's three-day Washington trip will be capped by a meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on Friday.
Biden and Modi will also hold a ""Quad"" summit with the leaders of Australia and Japan, aiming to boost cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region amid China's growing dominance in the area.

Modi on Thursday also met the chief executives of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and General Atomics, the sources said.
Modi, former chief minister of Gujarat before his 2014 national election win, was banned from traveling to the United States for a nearly a decade, following the massacre of 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in the state in 2002.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - San Francisco transport authorities on Thursday raised concerns about the safety record of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s advanced driver assistant system, as the electric car maker prepared a wide release of a test version of the software that works on city streets and highways.
The San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) also disputed the name of the system, ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) saying it is an advanced driver assistance program, not an autonomous vehicle system.
Tilly Chang, Executive Director of the SFCTA, said in a statement to Reuters that a human driver should ""continuously monitor"" Tesla's FSD system.
""We are concerned about the safety record of this service and the name of the service as it could be confusing for consumers, and hope DMV, FTC and NHTSA continue to monitor and analyze this issue to protect consumers and the traveling public,"" she said.  
The authority administers funding for transit and roadway projects in San Francisco. A number of Tesla crashes, now under federal investigation, have heightened regulatory scrutiny this year. 
On Monday, California's state regulator said: ""Based on information Tesla has provided the DMV, the feature does not make the vehicle an autonomous vehicle per California regulations.""
The California Department of Motor Vehicles reiterated that it was ""reviewing the company’s use of the term 'Full Self-Driving' for its technology.” 
Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Last week, Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla drivers would be able to request a “beta” version of its ""Full Self-Driving (FSD)"" software starting Friday. Those rated ""good drivers"" by Tesla's insurance calculator would be able to use the system.
Tesla sparked controversy by testing the unfinished technology to 2,000 people since October on public roads.
Musk said there have been no accidents with the beta users. 
""FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted,"" Musk tweeted. 

The beta offers features allowing vehicles to navigate and change lanes on city streets and enabling left and right turns.
Tesla has said the FSB beta ""may do the wrong thing at the worst time, so you must always keep your hands on the wheel.""

(Reuters) -Nike Inc on Thursday cut its fiscal 2022 sales expectations and said it expects delays during the holiday shopping season, blaming a supply chain crunch that has left it with soaring freight costs and products stuck in transit.
Months-long factory closures in Vietnam, where about half of all  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) footwear is manufactured, have piled more pressure on global supply chains already reeling from the impact of the pandemic.
The Beaverton, Oregon-based company's shares, which are down about 9% from their record high hit in August, fell 3.3% in extended trading after it said it now expects a mid-single-digit increase in full-year sales growth, versus the low-double-digit increase it had previously estimated.
Nike also said it expects second-quarter revenue growth to be in the range of ""flat to down low-single digits versus the prior year"" due to factory closures.
""In Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate. Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time,"" Nike Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said.
Nike said it had lost 10 weeks of production in Vietnam so far and it would take several months to ramp back to full production.
Brokerage BTIG this month downgraded Nike's stock, saying ""the risk of significant cancellations beginning this holiday and running through at least next spring has risen materially for Nike.""
""Transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels,"" Friend said, adding that Nike is facing similar issues in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Other apparel companies including Abercrombie & Fitch and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) have also taken a hit to their businesses due to production issues in Vietnam. Lockdowns in many parts of the country are set to last at least until the end of September.
Apparel retailers have had to grapple with higher raw material costs, and spend more on shipping to get their products in stores on time.
Retailer inventories are already trending at historic lows. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that at the end of July, stores had enough merchandise to cover only a little more than a month of sales, a sharp drop from the near two-month lead they had in April last year.

Nike said revenue rose to $12.25 billion from $10.59 billion in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, while analysts on average had expected $12.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Nike's net income rose 23% to $1.87 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the first quarter.

(Reuters) -Membership-only retail chain Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) said on Thursday it was reinstating limits on purchases of key items including bath tissues, roll towels and bottled water, spurred by panic buying from customers amid rising COVID-19 cases.
A resurgence in COVID-19 cases had led to stocking up of household essentials last year during stringent pandemic-led lockdowns, forcing the company to put limits on purchases of key items.
While there was a shortage of cleaning supplies even last year, transportation issues this year are causing delays in deliveries to stores despite suppliers having plenty of stock, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said in an earnings call. 
The pandemic-driven port congestion and labor shortages have forced retail chains including Costco to spend more on transportation and labor, digging into their margins. Costco said it was paying six times for containers and shipping due to price increase on items shipped overseas.
Shares in Costco, which beat market expectations for quarterly revenue on strong demand for fresh foods, snacks, household items and jewelry, were up about 1% after the bell. 
People returning to social events and outdoor activities following the rollout of vaccines has boosted demand for sporting goods and jewelry at Costco stores and helped offset some of the slowdown in sales of groceries following last year's lockdown-induced panic buying. 

Comparable sales, excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, jumped 9.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with estimates of an 8.07% rise, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Total revenue rose to $62.68 billion in the fourth quarter from $53.38 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $61.30 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -When a senior executive at virtual private network company ExpressVPN admitted to working on behalf of a foreign intelligence service to hack American machines last week, it stunned employees at his new company, according to interviews and electronic records.
What ExpressVPN said after the U.S. Justice Department's deferred prosecution https://www.reuters.com/world/us/american-hacker-mercenaries-face-us-charges-work-uae-2021-09-14 agreement disturbed some employees further. The company had known about Dan Gericke's history as a mercenary hacker for the United Arab Emirates. 
The VPN provider said it had no problem with the former intelligence operative protecting the privacy of its customers. In fact, the company had repeatedly given Gericke more responsibility at ExpressVPN even as the FBI investigation of his conduct pressed toward its conclusion. 
Gericke was named chief technology officer in August, according to an internal email at the time, and remains in the post. 
Shortly after the court filings showed Gericke and two other former U.S. intelligence operators agreeing to pay a fine and give up any future classified work, he emailed his colleagues at ExpressVPN.
""I can imagine that this kind of news is surprising or even uncomfortable,"" Gericke wrote in the message obtained by Reuters, then assured them that he had used his skills to protect consumers from threats to their security and privacy.
When senior company executives during a regular online question-and-answer session last Friday with employees accepted queries about Gericke's deal and then discussed the sale announced days earlier of the company https://www.reuters.com/technology/kape-technologies-buys-expressvpn-936-mln-2021-09-13 to British-Israeli digital security software provider Kape Technologies PLC, the workforce vented its anger.
One employee wrote anonymously on an internal chat board: ""This episode has eroded consumer's trust in our brand, regardless of the facts. How do we intend to rebuild our reputation?""
More than 40 employees voted in support of that question during the session, sending it to the top of the queue. Other employee complaints were reported earlier on Thursday by Vice. The questions and vote totals were made available to Reuters by someone authorized to have them.
Asked about the controversy, ExpressVPN said in a statement that the exchange was part of a regular monthly session between management and employees. 
""As a company, we value openness, dialogue and transparency -which includes robust debate and incisive questioning,"" the company said.
It said it had not known of the federal investigation or the details of Gericke's work in UAE, and it said that country's surveillance campaign was ""completely antithetical to our mission.""
A 2019 Reuters investigation showed how a team that Gericke was embedded within, codenamed Project Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-raven, had helped the UAE surveil a wide range of targets, including human rights activists and journalists. The story did not name Gericke individually. 
At ExpressVPN's session with leaders Friday, the second-most supported question also concerned him.

""As an individual I have a problem accepting that Dan was hired despite disclosing past actions. These actions are not small thing we can easily forget or accept. Don't they go against all the things XV stands for?"" that person asked.
To Reuters, the company responded: ""It's only through clear commitment and contributions to our mission that Daniel has been able to earn senior leadership roles within the company and the full confidence of our co-founders.""

311,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 06:26PM ET</span>","Stocks surge, dollar sags as investors digest Fed, Evergrande","By Lewis Krauskopf and Marc Jones
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets rallied on Thursday and the U.S. dollar retreated from one-month highs as worries faded about contagion from China Evergrande and as investors digested the Federal Reserve's plans for reining in U.S. stimulus.
Wall Street's main indexes all ended up at least 1% following solid advances in European markets. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe jumped 1.01%, its biggest percentage rise in a month and for a third straight session of gains that brought it all the way back from Monday, when it posted its biggest percentage drop in two months after fears linked to debt-laden property group Evergrande.
It was a case of “unwind of the fear from what happened in China. Markets got over-sold and pessimistic very quickly and then you have basically seen a buy-the-dip mentality,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.
Evergrande shares jumped 18% ahead of a key debt payment deadline. Gold prices dropped as safe-haven trades faded.
Investors were still mulling implications from the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday that it should begin reducing monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signalled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
“In some ways, the Fed had prepared investors that they were going to taper and somehow just getting that news out there even if some people perceived it as more hawkish is like a sigh of relief,” Lerner said.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 506.5 points, or 1.48%, to 34,764.82, the S&P 500 gained 53.34 points, or 1.21%, to 4,448.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 155.40 points, or 1.04%, to 15,052.24.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.93%. 
Norway's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate and said it expects to hike again in December, joining a growing list of nations moving away from emergency-level borrowing costs. Norway's crown strengthened versus the euro to its highest since mid-June.
In other currency trading, the dollar index fell 0.428% after hitting a one-month high and the euro rose 0.45% to $1.1739. The Japanese yen weakened 0.46% at 110.31 per dollar.
Sterling was last trading at $1.3722, up 0.71%, after the Bank of England said two policymakers had voted for an early end to government bond buying and markets brought forward expectations of an interest rate rise to March.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 30/32 in price, pushing the yield to 1.4336%, its highest since early July, from 1.331% late on Wednesday. Key Euro area bond yields also climbed after hawkish signals from central banks.
Oil prices rose, supported by growing fuel demand and a draw in U.S. crude inventories as production remained hampered in the Gulf of Mexico after two hurricanes.

U.S. crude settled up 1.5% at $73.30 per barrel and Brent settled at $77.25, up 1.4% on the day.
Spot gold dropped 1.3% to $1,745.29 an ounce.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group dollar bondholders were still waiting for information about a key interest payment due Thursday that has kept global investors on tenterhooks, but the property developer was instead expected to provide more clarity in the coming month, a source familiar with the situation said.
Evergrande's payment obligations have captured global attention in recent weeks as fears have spread that its difficulties could pose systemic risks to China's financial system and possibly to other markets.
The company, which epitomises the borrow-to-build business model and was once China's top-selling developer, has run into trouble over the past few months as Beijing tightened rules in the property sector to rein in debt levels and speculation.
""Clearly, the risk is a ripple effect, especially for Wall Street correlated world markets which have become very used to bailouts,"" wrote Christopher Wood at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in a research report. 
Evergrande resolved one coupon payment on a Shenzhen-traded bond earlier in the week but was due to pay $83.5 million in interest on a $2 billion offshore bond on Thursday and also has a $47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment next week. 
Both offshore bonds would default if the company, which has outstanding debt of $305 billion, fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates. 
Some holders had given up hope of getting a coupon payment on the $2 billion offshore bond by Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said.
A holder of the U.S. dollar bond said that they had not received payment as of the close of Thursday in Asia. 
As the close of the day drew nearer in New York, there had still been no announcements by Evergrande about the payment. A company spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. 
Earlier on Thursday, Bloomberg Law reported that Chinese regulators had asked Evergrande executives to avoid a near-term default on its dollar bonds and to communicate proactively with bondholders, citing people familiar with the matter.
""They don't want a default right now,"" said Connor Yuan, the head of emerging market flow credit trading for Asia at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""Given there is a 30-day grace period, I think today it's very likely the coupon won't be made but it is possible that they try to get a deal done in the next 30 days.""
The Wall Street Journal reported separately on Thursday that Chinese authorities were asking local governments to prepare for the potential downfall of Evergrande, China's second-biggest property developer, citing officials familiar with the talks.
A spokesperson for Evergrande, China's second-biggest property developer, declined to comment on the two reports.
""Evergrande is a serious situation but we see it as quite contained both in terms of the sector, mainly Chinese real estate, and mostly Chinese counterparties,"" Jean-Yves Fillion, chief executive officer of BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) USA, told CNBC on Thursday.
""Historically we have seen the Chinese administration taking care of these type of situations and resolving them. The linkages between the Evergrande situation and the strong U.S. equity market we see as not very significant."" 
Graphic: Evergrande's debt pile - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA%20EVERGRANDE-DEBT/jnvweyjjlvw/CHINA-EVERGRANDE.jpg 
SHARES BOUNCE BACK
Investors worry that the Evergrande rot could spread to creditors including banks in China and abroad, though analysts have been downplaying the risk that a collapse would result in a ""Lehman moment,"" or a systemic liquidity crunch. 
Still, central bankers say they are keeping a close eye on Evergrande. The Bank of England said on Thursday it did not expect the situation to go badly wrong and was cautiously optimistic Beijing would avoid any major issues.
Shares in Evergrande rose nearly 18% on Thursday after it said it had resolved the coupon payment for one of its domestic, onshore bonds, though the stock is down more than 80% this year.
Shares in Evergrande Property Services rose nearly 8% and relief spread to mainland property stocks listed in Hong Kong. Country Garden, China's largest developer, climbed 7%, Sunac China jumped 9% and Guangzhou R&F Properties ended 7.5% higher.
Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan urged his executives late on Wednesday to ensure the delivery of quality properties and the redemption of its wealth management products, which are typically held by millions of retail investors in China.
He did not mention the company's offshore debt, however. 
The WSJ said local governments had been ordered to assemble groups of accountants and legal experts to examine the finances around Evergrande's operations in their respective regions. 
They have also been ordered to talk to local state-owned and private property developers to prepare to take over projects and set up law-enforcement teams to monitor public anger and ""mass incidents"", a euphemism for protests, it said. 
Analysts said the moves by Beijing underscored the pressure on Evergrande, whose liabilities run to 2% of China's gross domestic product, to contain the fallout from its credit crunch and protect mom-and-pop investors over professional creditors. 
Graphic: China’s most indebted property companies - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA%20EVERGRANDE-DEBT/mopankdldva/CHINA-EVERGRANDE-INDEBTED.jpg 
'ALL MY SAVINGS'
Oscar Choi, founder and chief investment officer at Oscar and Partners Capital Ltd, said Evergrande was wary of inflaming social tensions by leaving homes unbuilt, construction workers unpaid and retail investors counting their losses.
Once those priorities had been met, Evergrande would talk to its other creditors, he said, adding: ""Otherwise a few hundred thousand people will fight with the government.""
At an eerily quiet construction site in eastern China, worker Li Hongjun said Evergrande's crisis meant he will soon run out of food while Christina Xie, who works in the southern city of Shenzhen, feared Evergrande had swallowed her savings.

""It's all my savings. I was planning to use it for me and my partner's old age,"" said Xie. ""Evergrande is one of China's biggest real estate companies ... my consultant told me the product was guaranteed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Thursday it is time to get ""aggressive"" in addressing the worsening semiconductor chip shortage that has caused automakers and others to cut production and impacted thousands of U.S. workers.
""It’s time to get more aggressive. The situation is not getting better, in some ways it is getting worse,” Raimondo told Reuters in an interview. She said a voluntary request for information issued on chips to industry this week ""will give us more information about the supply chain, and the goal is to increase transparency so we can try to identify where the bottlenecks (are) and then predict challenges.""
She warned if companies did not answer the voluntary request ""then we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give us data. I hope we don't get there. But if we have to we will.""
The White House was hosting a pair of virtual meetings on semiconductors on Thursday
Automakers from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
""Realistically, there is no quick and easy fix,"" Raimondo said. ""We are going to be dealing with this well into next year.""
In June, the Senate voted to approve $52 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor production.
""Fundamentally the solution is that we need to make more chips, and we need to make more chips in America, which is why the House can't pass the Chips Act fast enough, as far as I am concerned. We need the money, we need to make more chips,"" Raimondo said.
She added that she was ""optimistic that we could make some incremental progress in the next handful of months"" by boosting supply-chain transparency. ""There's a lack of trust in the supply chain. There's probably some over-ordering going on, you know. There might be some ... suppliers sending chips here because they can make more money, instead of here.""

Companies attending the virtual White House meetings include Detroit's Big Three automakers, plus Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW AG, GlobalFoundries, Micron (NASDAQ:MU),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (KS:005930), TSMC and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
A group representing major automakers said the industry and semiconductor companies are ""working diligently to resolve the global chip shortage as quickly and efficiently as possible ... and to strengthen transparency and resiliency in the automotive semiconductor supply chain.""

Additionally, the stock is quite cheap and has found some new growth drivers during the pandemic. Read on to find out why it's the growth stock of the week.Though technology stocks receive outsized attention, there are a number of companies in a variety of other sectors with significant earnings growth. One of the most notable examples is restaurant stocks, like Brinker International (EAT). 
The pandemic led to a drop in revenues for EAT, which means the company faces easy comps this year. The economy returning to normal also implies increased volume at restaurants. Further, the pandemic led to tougher conditions with rising costs and a shortage of workers, resulting in many restaurant closures.
However, these headwinds are more than offset by the tailwind from the economy reopening as the company delivered 79% revenue growth and 230% earnings growth in its last quarter. While the pandemic has been a net-negative for the restaurant industry, one silver lining for the ones that made it through the pandemic is that they will face less competition. Further, public companies with more resources will be able to withstand cost pressure and invest in technology that could replace some labor.

While the Fed’s signal this week that it will continue supporting the economic recovery, for now, fueled a rally in the major benchmarks, the largest Chinese real estate company Evergrande’s potential collapse could fuel volatility in the near term. Therefore, we think it could be wise to invest in large-cap stocks, which are known for their ability to withstand market volatility and generate stable returns. Investors’ interest in large-cap stocks is evidenced by the Vanguard Large-Cap Index Fund ETF’s (VV) 33% gains over the past year.
So, the likely market pullback could be an excellent opportunity to bet on fundamentally sound large-cap stocks América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ),  LyondellBasell Industries  N.V. (NYSE:LYB), and ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:ASX). These four names look undervalued at their current price levels.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Minnesota agricultural firm Crystal Valley Cooperative said it had been targeted in a ransomware attack in recent days, making it the second Midwestern farm-services provider in a week to be forced to take systems offline due to cybersecurity incidents.
Crystal Valley, which sells supplies like fertilizer to farmers and buys their crops, said it became aware of the attack on Sunday, prompting it to take operating systems offline and to stop accepting major credit cards.
""This attack has infected the computer systems at Crystal Valley and severely interrupted the daily operations of the company,"" Crystal Valley said in a statement on its website. It asked customers for understanding while the company resolves the issue.
The attack left Crystal Valley unable to mix fertilizer or fulfil orders for livestock feed, said Kevin Paap, a corn and soybean farmer in Garden City, Minnesota, on Thursday. 
""With the help of some other local co-ops, they're helping grind some feed and sharing the burden,"" he said.
NEW Cooperative Inc in Iowa said on Monday its systems were offline to contain a cybersecurity incident. A Russian-speaking cybercriminal group named BlackMatter said on its website that it stole data from the farm services provider.
The disruptions are hitting the Farm Belt as growers gear up for the autumn harvest.
Crystal Valley operates eight grain elevators with the capacity to store a total of 25 million bushels in Minnesota, the third biggest U.S. soybean-producing state and fourth biggest corn producer, according to its website. Two locations load huge 110-car trains for delivery to big buyers or exporters. 
Paap, president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau, said he has been able to deliver grain to Crystal Valley's elevator in Vernon Center with minor delays as the normally automated process is offline.

""It's old school, with hand-written tickets instead of the computer reading the card on the side of your truck as you drive in,"" he said.
Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the Biden administration's agenda after high-profile attacks that affected U.S. fuel and food supplies.

It said a federal grand jury in Fort Myers, Florida, returned an indictment on Wednesday charging Gyetvay, a Florida businessman, with defrauding the United States. Gyetvay holds passports https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-sanctions-novatek-idUSKCN1UH1PL from both the United States and Russia. 
According to the indictment, from 2005 to 2016, Gyetvay allegedly engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States by concealing his ownership and control over substantial offshore assets and by failing to file and pay taxes on millions of dollars of income.
Gyetvay, who sat on the board of Novatek's directors and was its chief financial officer from 2003 to 2014, did not return phone calls. Novatek declined to comment.
Beginning in 2005, Gyetvay allegedly opened the first of two different Swiss bank accounts to hold these assets, which at one point had an aggregate value of over $93 million, the Department of Justice said.
Gyetvay was appointed Novatek's deputy head of management board in July 2010.

He was scheduled to appear in court on Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Frazier of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. 
He faces a lengthy prison sentence if convicted of the charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to give $1 billion to Israel for its Iron Dome missile-defense system, two days after objections from the most liberal Democrats forced leaders to remove it from a broader spending bill.
The measure passed by 420 to 9 - eight no's from Democrats and one from a Republican - with two members voting present. That sent the measure to the Senate, where leaders have not yet scheduled a vote.
A handful of progressive House Democrats, who have accused Israel of human rights abuses against Palestinians, had objected to the provision's inclusion in the broad spending bill. That threatened the bill's passage, with Democrats only narrowly controlling the House, because Republicans opposed the plan to fund the federal government through Dec. 3 and raise the nation's borrowing limit.
The House passed the broader bill on Tuesday. But the removal of the Iron Dome funding angered centrist Democrats and led Republicans to label the party as anti-Israel, despite a long tradition in the U.S. Congress of strong support from both parties for the Jewish state.
The House's Democratic leaders immediately said they would introduce a standalone bill to provide the Iron Dome funding.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett thanked both parties in the House for their support. ""Those who try to challenge this support got a resounding response today,"" he said in a statement.
The liberal Democrats have criticized U.S.-Israel policy, saying there should be more concern for human rights issues like Palestinian civilian casualties as Israel struck back after Hamas rocket attacks in May. 

""We should also be talking about the Palestinian need for protection against Israeli attack,"" Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, an opponent of the funding, said during debate. 
The $1 billion in the Iron Dome funding bill is intended to replace missile interceptors Israel used to ward off rockets fired from Gaza during the May conflict.

Travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 health emergency hit civil aviation hard last year, before a gradual recovery began to set in.
""What we're seeing are different speeds of recovery,"" Barreira told Reuters in an interview. ""Obviously the domestic market and tourism are leading the way, while the long distance and business markets will take longer.""
Overall, the market would be back at pre-pandemic levels by roughly 2023 or early 2024, he said.
The executive said regional improvement would be driven mainly in Mexico by a strong showing by low-cost airlines VivaAerobus and Volaris, two Airbus clients. 
Between January and July, Mexican airlines transported28.6 million passengers, a jump of over 50% from the same period last year, official data showed. But that was still well below the 40.4 million travelers logged in the same period in 2019. 

Barreira said during 2021, Airbus has so far delivered 25 aircraft to the region's airlines, two fewer than in all of 2020. The planemaker expects to sell more than 27 aircraft this year, but Barreira declined to say how many exactly.
Nearly 700 Airbus aircraft currently operate inLatin America and the Caribbean, or 60% of the fleet in service.

But which is currently the better buy?.Electric vehicle (EV) stocks have trailed the market in 2021, after a spectacular run in 2020. However, this current underperformance is providing an opportunity for investors to buy the dip, as the companies in this space remain poised for spectacular growth in the next decade.
Much of this growth is due to the shift towards clean energy solutions, supported by federal and state governments all around the world via subsidies and other benefits. This in turn will attract both legacy automobile players as well as new entrants into the EV market.

This includes the Delta variant of COVID, the wariness before today's Fed meeting, a potential crash in China real estate, and the potential that Congress won't raise the debt ceiling. However, for today, stocks bounced back as investors reacted positively to remarks from the Fed. So, where does that leave investors? I’ll discuss this and more below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published September 22, 2021 from the POWR Value newsletter).
Since my last commentary, the market fell last Thursday even after a better-than-expected report on retail sales. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% after a 1.8% drop in July. This suggests that consumer spending held up despite concerns over the Delta variant of COVID.
While new unemployment claims posted an unexpected slight gain, rising to 332,000, this is still a low figure during the pandemic. Then, a new report showed that consumer sentiment missed estimates in early September and is near a decade low due to continued concerns over inflation.

Investing.com -  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) reported Thursday mixed first-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue fell short of expectations as ongoing supply-chain issues held back sales.
Nike shares lost 4.06% in after-hours trade following the report.
Nike announced earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $12.25 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.12 on revenue of $12.46 bilion.
Nike brand digital sales increased 29%, led by North America growth of 43%. Sales in China, a key market for the company, was up 11% to $1.98 billion.
Inventories were flat at $6.7 billion, compared to the prior year period amid elevated in-transit inventories due to ""extended lead times from ongoing supply chain disruptions,"" the company said.
Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 46.5 percent, led by margin expansion in the company's direct business, a higher mix of full-price sales and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
These tailwinds, however, were partially offset by higher product costs primarily due to increased freight costs, the company said.

Investing.com -- Stocks roared back on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 preparing to end their best day in months with just a half-hour left in the session.
Jobless claims data earlier in the day, which came in slightly higher than expected for the previous week, eased fears that the Federal Reserve would act too soon to take its foot off the stimulus pedal it has been pressing since last year.
On Wednesday, the Fed said it could begin reducing its monthly bond purchases by as soon as November, and that interest rates could rise quicker than expected by next year. 
This boosted bank stocks, which were among the day’s best performers because financial companies benefit when rates rise, allowing them bigger profits from lending.
Federal spending and the debt limit are also overhangs on the market. Democrat leaders in Congress announced a tentative deal on Thursday that would pay for President Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion social safety net initiatives, though they didn’t offer details,
Earlier this week, House Democrats passed a measure that would fund the government past Sept. 30 and push the debt ceiling expiration back to the end of 2022, though Republicans have vowed to fight it, threatening a government shutdown.
Worries about the default of China property developer Evergrande also continued to ease. The looming prospect of a debt payment default sent stocks tumbling around the world earlier this week.
Data last week showed a surprise jump in retail sales, an indication that back-to-school shopping and other consumer spending has remained strong.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",Investors look ahead to rate hikes with Fed tapering plan all but certain,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are grappling with how an unwind of the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies could affect asset prices, after the central bank signaled that a taper of its bond-buying program was closer than ever and suggested it may raise rates at a faster-than-expected pace.
In what some described as a hawkish tilt, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cleared the way to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November, and nine of 18 U.S. central bank policymakers projected borrowing costs will need to rise in 2022.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank could conclude its tapering process around the middle of next year, as long as the recovery remains on track.
The focus on rate increases comes as investors gauge how markets will respond to an unwind of the central bank’s $120 billion per month bond-buying program, which has helped the S&P 500 double from its March 2020 lows. 
Though many had expected the central bank to begin its unwind before the year was up, some investors said the projection for rate increases may spur worries over whether the Fed risks tightening monetary policy at a time when the economy could be significantly weaker than it is today, potentially undercutting the case for stocks and other comparatively risky assets.
""With this hawkish move, the Fed risks tightening policy into a slow-growth backdrop,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. 
Stocks held onto their gains after the Fed’s statement, with the S&P 500 closing up nearly 1%. 
In Treasury markets, the gap between five-year notes and 30-year bonds fell below 100 basis points after the Fed policy statement to the lowest level since July 2020. A narrower gap could indicate factors like economic uncertainty, easing inflation concerns and anticipation of tighter monetary policy.
“The rates market interpreted Fed communications as hawkish,” analysts at BoFA Global Research said in a note. “The more hawkish Fed is a key ingredient for our higher rates view into year-end.”
The Fed funds market fully priced in a rate hike by January 2023 after the statement, moving projected rate increases forward by a month. 
Analysts at TD Securities expect the central bank to reduce its asset purchases by $15 billion a month starting in November, helping push up yields and strengthen the dollar, they said in a report. 
The U.S. currency's trajectory is important for investors as it impacts everything from commodity prices to corporate earnings. Higher yields make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to income-seeking investors. The greenback was up 0.23% against a basket of its peers late Wednesday. 
""Once the dust settles it seems that there are enough hawkish signals to keep the dollar biased higher, as the market pencils in a sooner-than-expected rate hike,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions. 
Others were sanguine on the Fed’s outlook, saying the more hawkish view was a reflection of the economy’s strength in the face of a COVID-19 resurgence. 
Markets are likely to remain more focused on the inference that additional rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 would suggest a strengthening economy than on the Fed's tapering plan, said Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Socorro Asset Management. 
""Powell clarified repeatedly ... that the criteria for tapering is very different than criteria for raising rates, which is much higher"" and will have more of a market impact, he said. 

Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said in a note that robust demand for Treasuries would likely minimize the impact of the Fed’s unwind.
“With the demand for income and financial assets that we’re seeing..., the modest tapering likely to be seen from the Fed is not consequential for markets,” he said.

The U.S. airline last month said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Delta said financial incentives such as an additional day of paid time off and $100 in health rewards, allowed it to vaccinate nearly 70% of its employees by June.
United Airlines on Wednesday said more than 97% of its U.S. employees have been vaccinated ahead of the company's Sept. 27 deadline for staff vaccination.

LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish carmaker Volvo Cars said on Thursday that its vehicle range will go leather-free or 'vegan-friendly' by 2030, offering instead bio-based and recycled materials to a customer base that increasingly wants sustainably sourced products.
""We've got a new generation of customers coming through, they're far more interested in the products they buy and having an ethical story behind them,"" Robin Page, Volvo's head of design, told Reuters. ""They want to understand where the materials come from.""
Volvo said the shift recognises customer concerns over animal welfare issues in the leather industry and the environmental impacts of cattle farming.
It also coincides with the sustainable aspirations of Volvo's plan to offer an all-electric car lineup by 2030.
Volvo's current all-electric C40 Recharge model is already leather-free, and the company is exploring using materials such as Nordico - made from forestry byproducts, recycled corks and plastic bottles - that head of design Page said has the same ""softness and warmth"" as leather. 
""For someone who loves leather but is aware of the negative effects of leather on the environment, this is a good, modern way to capture the properties but is the right material for the future,"" Page said.

The carmaker also aims to use recycled polyester to cut its carbon footprint and linen from flax plants grown in Sweden in between crops, which replenishes the soil. Volvo will also use flax fibres for door panels.
""Consumers are not just focused on the sustainability of the end product but also the material that goes into it, including the sourcing"" said Stuart Templar, Volvo's director of global sustainability.

Ongoing supply chain issues are driving high demand for transportation, warehousing, and logistics services. Therefore, we believe that fundamentally sound freight stocks Ryder (R), Daseke (NASDAQ:DSKE),  P.A.M. Transportation  (PTSI), and Covenant Logistics (CVLG) could be solid bets now. So, let’s pore over these names.As the economic recovery and solid progress on the vaccination front help industries resume their operations and gradually return to pre-pandemic capacity, the need for the transportation of raw materials, equipment, and other goods is on the rise. Notably, ongoing supply chain issues have been driving the rising demand for transportation, logistics, and warehousing services. With many freight companies now increasing their capacity to meet the increasing demand, the industry should witness solid growth.
Also, an increased focus on improving fuel efficiency and a growing interest in autonomous trucking should help freight companies grow further. The global freight trucking market is expected to grow at a 3% CAGR to $1.11 trillion by 2027.
Hence, we believe Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), Daseke, Inc. (DSKE), P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTSI), and Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. (CVLG) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

Instead of hiring more seasonal workers, the company said it will offer more work hours to existing employees during the busy period, resulting in about $75 million more into their paychecks.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) currently has more than 350,000 workers.
Retailers and restaurants have been offering pay raises and other incentives to retain staff, with many worried that they will not have enough workers during the holiday shopping season, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.
Target, which increased its starting wage to $15 last year, announced plans to hire about 130,000 seasonal workers each year in 2019 and 2020.
The company was among the few retailers that enjoyed an upbeat holiday season last year, with its comparable sales increasing 17.2%, as investments in its online business helped Target gain market share from smaller brick-and-mortar rivals.

To better support in-store pickup and a service where store workers bring customer orders to their cars, Target this year is tripling the number of its store fulfillment expert roles over the last two years.
Rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is bringing in 20,000 workers at its supply chain division ahead of the holiday season.

The appointment comes as the health services unit, which was rebranded last September to Evernorth, has shown resilient growth in the last few quarters.
The company's shares were up 1.1% at $204.15 in mid-day trading.
Palmer, who has been with Cigna for 23 years and most recently served as the chief operating office of Evernorth, will start in his new role from January.
Tim Wentworth, the current CEO of Evernorth, will retire by the end of this year, the company said.
The health insurer also announced several other leadership changes to help accelerate growth across its business portfolio.
Health insurers are facing several challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including direct costs related to testing, treatment and vaccinations, as well as higher disenrollment in employer-sponsored plans caused by its economic impact.
Evernorth includes pharmacy solutions, care coordination and delivery, pharmacy benefit management, and intelligence businesses.

The pharmacy benefit management business Cigna acquired through the 2018 buyout of Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) is part of the unit, as well as the company's specialty pharmacy business Accredo.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and pharmacies to negotiate prescription drug prices.

The listing comes amid a fertile market for newly issued shares, particularly those of tech companies, which led to recent strong debuts for restaurant software provider Toast Inc and enterprise software firm Freshworks Inc.
The stock opened at $52.9, up from its IPO price of $43 per share.
Remitly is a digital, cross-border remittance provider that promises faster, affordable and more transparent money transfers. The customers are primarily immigrants, according to the company, and its services are used in more than 135 countries.
Founded in 2011, Remitly earns from transactions fees and foreign exchange spreads. It was inspired by co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Oppenheimer's time in Kenya, where he was able to observe first-hand the difficulties faced by families in sending money overseas.
The cross-border remittance market recorded $540 billion in income flows to low- and middle-income countries in 2020, according to a World Bank report, only $8 billion less than in 2019.
The Seattle, Washington-based company has relationships with various banks and payment providers including  Barclays  (LON:BARC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s retail bank, HSBC,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V).
It priced roughly 12.16 million shares of its common stock on Wednesday to raise nearly $523 million. The IPO was priced above the $38 to $42 range Remitly had announced earlier.
About 5.13 million of those shares were sold by the selling stockholders, proceeds from which would not go to the company.

PayU Fintech Investments, one of Remitly's existing shareholders, has agreed to purchase $25 million worth of the company's shares in a private placement.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters of the offering.

(Reuters) -European stocks rallied for a third day on Thursday as global sentiment improved on easing concerns about cash-strapped developer China Evergrande, while comments from Bank of England kept London shares under pressure. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.9%, looking to end the week with solid gains after a sharp selloff on Monday. European banks rose 2.2% to lead gains.
UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 lagged regional indexes with a 0.1% fall after the Bank of England said the case for higher interest rates ""appeared to have strengthened"" after it nudged up inflation forecasts for the year.
""Today's BoE meeting produced little in the way of concrete changes, and it still believes that price rises will moderate next year, essentially a recognition that even if they did raise rates it wouldn't really do much at present to slow the rise in prices,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
Evergrande closed 17% higher in Hong Kong as its chairman sought to reassure investors after the company's unit said it had ""resolved"" a coupon payment on an onshore bond.
However, the property developer's Frankfurt-listed shares tumbled 20.1%.
""It was a bit of a September panic,"" said Will James, fund manager of Premier Miton European Equity Income. ""It's a big issue but it's not necessarily one which will spill over beyond Evergrande and the Chinese property sector. 
""We are at a point where we've had an aggressive COVID recovery, we're past peak growth and there's a question mark over the end of QE (quantitative easing). The problem with liquidity pulled out of the market brings with it the potential for more volatility.""
A survey showed euro zone business activity grew at its weakest pace in five months in September as curbs to limit the Delta variant of coronavirus hit demand and supply-chain constraints pushed input costs to a more than two-decade high.
The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signalled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
Boosting the auto sector, French car parts company Faurecia jumped 6.7% as a strong cash flow guidance outweighed lowered 2021 financial targets due to a sharp reduction in worldwide automotive production. 

Rivals  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) gained 8.4% and Continental added 2.5% after a recent bout of weakness in the sector. 
French vaccine maker Valneva climbed about 5.7% after it said it was expanding trials of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate and remained in talks with the European Commission over a potential contract.

(Reuters) -Novavax Inc and its partner Serum Institute of India have applied to the World Health Organization for an emergency use listing of  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX)'s COVID-19 vaccine, potentially clearing the way for the shot to ship to many poorer countries, the company said on Thursday. 
Novavax has been prioritizing regulatory submissions to low- and middle-income countries after falling behind in the race for authorization in the United States and Europe, which have already vaccinated most of their residents. 
A WHO listing would allow Novavax to ship to multiple developing nations that rely on WHO guidance for their regulatory decisions. 
It would also allow Novavax to begin distributing shots through the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. 
Novavax has already submitted regulatory documents to countries including India, the Philippines and Indonesia. 
Novavax shares were up more than 10% in morning trading following the announcement. 
Novavax and India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine producer, have together committed to providing more than 1.1 billion doses to the COVAX facility. 
COVAX has distributed fewer than 300 million shots to poorer nations, a fraction of the roughly 6 billion shots experts say are needed. 
The United States earlier this week said it was committing an additional 500 million vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) to COVAX, bringing its total contribution to more than 1 billion shots.
Novavax had previously said it would apply for WHO authorization in August, marking a slight delay in the filing. It expects to file for regulatory authorization in the United States and European Union in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine production ramp-up has been fraught with delays and it is unclear how many Novavax shots will be available for the COVAX facility this year. Novavax said in August it was aiming to produce 100 million shots monthly by the end of the third quarter. 

The Novavax shot is a protein-based vaccine, and was shown to be more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage U.S.-based clinical trial. 
Early studies suggest Novavax is effective at protecting against the contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, which has become dominant in many countries.

MADRID (Reuters) - Surging natural gas prices across Europe could hinder the economic recovery in Spain, where small businesses crucial to local employment are more exposed than elsewhere on the continent to steep rises in power bills.
Energy bills have more than doubled in Spain and other European countries as gas prices rocket on factors such as low storage stocks, tipping companies into crisis and forcing governments to come up with measures to cushion the blow.
The fallout from record high gas prices has hit even food producers as suppliers of carbon dioxide - used in the vacuum packing of food products to extend their shelf life and to put the fizz into beer and soft drinks - seize up.
Spain is particularly exposed to the spike in household fuel bills due to a high share of customers with flexible tariffs, which are sensitive to price movements, analysts say.
Small businesses, which account for a disproportionately high 61.3% of Spanish economic activity and 71.9% of total employment, are suffering especially. 
Less able than large corporations to weather the high prices, they say they are struggling to invest in re-hiring and expansion as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic which saw gross domestic product shrink a historic 10.8% in 2020.
""We can hardly cover expenses,"" said Mayra Maldonado, 41, who runs a historic dry cleaning shop in the centre of Madrid with her partner, Gladys Mariscal.
""In a pre-COVID August, we had a turnover of 6,000 euros and about 600 euros of power bill. This August we have made 3,000 euros and we paid 1,050 euros for electricity.""
Maldonado worked through an August heatwave when the temperature routinely exceeded 40 degrees Celsius with hardly any air conditioning in an effort to keep down bills in a business needing electrical appliances during peak hours.
After working as an employee for 15 years she took over the business in March 2020, a few days before the first major lockdown was imposed.
""We have a turnover 40% of what this dry cleaner was making, remote work has affected us a lot.""
POTENTIAL SAVINGS DRAIN 
Recent indicators pointed to a solid revival of the economy, as high vaccination rates bolstered activity and tourists flocked to sunny destinations over the summer. The government expects the economy to rebound to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. 
However, the recovery so far has been heavily dependent on spending by consumers who are now facing 35% annual rises in their power bills. 
That could drain 20 billion euros in savings for households and small businesses, according to estimates by Raymond Torres, chief economist of the Funcas thinktank
""The impact of the power hike comes after a terrible crisis. It is not the same to assume these costs now than in 2019,"" said Luis Aribayos, secretary general of Spain's association of small and medium-sized companies. 
The Bank of Spain, in line with the European Central Bank, said the rise is temporary and will not affect the economy. But analysts reckon that even if transitory, this will erode profit margins and competitiveness.
""Small businesses have had to empty the coffers and go into debt. They can't take it anymore,"" Aribayo said. 
The government approved last week an emergency package to mitigate the rise in prices, reducing taxes and putting a cap on gas, so that it does not pick up all the increase in the wholesale markets. 
Italy and Greece are in a similar position and are looking for Spanish-style solutions to prevent sudden price rises from hitting consumers' pockets. Britain too is mulling support for energy companies and has warned that more of its energy suppliers could be forced out of business.
For the time being, Spanish businesses - who could see the impact of the government salve in upcoming bills - have decided to absorb these increases and not pass them on to their customers, slowing the inflationary spiral.
""Prices can't be touched, they can't be raised. If you go up 50 cents, the customer leaves. But for us, the increase in electricity is much more. We have not touched prices for five years,"" said Maldonado. 

Torres estimates that inflation will reach 4.5% by the end of the year, the highest in more than a decade, and said that although transitory, the impact on the recovery will have a negative impact.
""The rise in prices is more pronounced in Spain than in Italy and France, even exceeding euro zone inflation and that is not a positive element for our competitiveness,"" said Alicia Coronil, chief economist at Singular Bank, also warning of a deterioration in consumer sentiment.

As per the company’s previously announced plans, it aims to have nearly 65% of its fleet capacity in operation by December 31.
To date, eight of the company's nine cruise line brands have resumed guest sailings. By the end of October, those eight brands will operate 42 ships, marking the return of over 50% of the company's global fleet capacity.
The sailings will be from the U.S., Mexico, Caribbean, the U.K., Western Europe and the Mediterranean, among others, the company said.
The cruise and leisure travel industry has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic as governments imposed severe restrictions on their operation even after services resumed.

The grant of emergency use license by the WHO is a prerequisite for exports to countries participating in the Covax facility, which was established to allocate and distribute vaccines equitably to participating countries.
Novavax and SII last month completed the submission of modules required by regulatory agencies in India, Indonesia and the Philippines for the initiation of review of the vaccine. SII is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by capacity and also makes the Covid-19 shot developed by AstraZeneca. 
The submission of the application comes after several months of delay that has seen the likes of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Gamaleya (Sputnik) race ahead in providing vaccines to millions of people worldwide.  
The vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is a protein-based vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of the first strain of the coronavirus and comes at a time when the virus has mutated, leaving its Delta variant as the dominant strain in most countries of the world.
NVX-CoV2373 was created using Novavax' recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein.
Novavax' COVID-19 vaccine is packaged as a ready-to-use liquid formulation in a vial containing ten doses. The vaccination regimen calls for two 0.5 ml doses given intramuscularly 21 days apart. The vaccine is stored at 2°- 8° Celsius, enabling the use of existing vaccine supply and cold chain channels.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel thinks the coronavirus pandemic could be over in a year as increased vaccine production ensures global supplies, he told the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
""If you look at the industry-wide expansion of production capacities over the past six months, enough doses should be available by the middle of next year so that everyone on this earth can be vaccinated. Boosters should also be possible to the extent required,"" he told the newspaper in an interview.
Vaccinations would soon be available even for infants, he said.
""Those who do not get vaccinated will immunize themselves naturally, because the Delta variant is so contagious. In this way we will end up in a situation similar to that of the flu. You can either get vaccinated and have a good winter. Or you don't do it and risk getting sick and possibly even ending up in hospital.""
Asked if that meant a return to normal in the second half of next year, he said: ""As of today, in a year, I assume.""
Bancel said he expected governments to approve booster shots for people already vaccinated because patients at risk who were vaccinated last autumn ""undoubtedly"" needed a refresher.
Its booster shot had half the dose of the original dose, which meant more of them would be available.
""The volume of vaccine is the biggest limiting factor. With half the dose, we would have 3 billion doses available worldwide for the coming year instead of just 2 billion,"" he said.
The composition of the booster shot remains the same as the original for this year because Moderna had not had enough time to change it. 

""We are currently testing Delta-optimized variants in clinical trials. They will form the basis for the booster vaccination for 2022. We are also trying out Delta plus Beta, the next mutation that scientists believe is likely.""
Moderna can use existing production lines for the new variants as for the original COVID-19 vaccine. The price of vaccination will stay the same, he said.

Evergrande, which is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on a $2 billion offshore bond on Thursday and also has a $47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment next week. 
Both bonds would default if the company, which has outstanding debt of $305 billion, fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates. 
The company has yet to make an announcement about its plans for the offshore bond payment obligation. 
A spokesperson for Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
While some of the bondholders are not expecting the payment on Thursday, they are expecting Evergrande to provide some clarity over the next month or so, said the person, who declined to be named due to confidentiality constraints.

By late evening on Thursday in Asia, these bondholders had yet to receive any information from Evergrande about the payments due on Thursday, the first source and another person familiar with the matter said.
Reuters was unable to determine whether Evergrande has told bondholders what it plans to do regarding the coupon payment due on Thursday. The first source said there had been very little communication from the company.

Investing.com – Dell Technologies stock (NYSE:DELL) rose 3.8% Thursday after the company gave long-term guidance and announced a couple of pro-shareholder moves including a dividend and a share buyback.
The company expects a compounded annual growth of 3% to 4% in revenue and a more than 6% rise in adjusted earnings per share through financial year 2026. The company is currently in the third quarter of financial year 2022.
Dell plans to return 40% to 60% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends from the next financial year which starts February.
The company also proposes to repurchase shares worth up to $5 billion beginning November 2021, upon the projected completion of the VMware (NYSE:VMW) spin-off. The company also plans to initiate dividends payouts every three months from the first quarter of the next financial year.
It is targeting an annual dividend of approximately $1 billion on its equity base that stands at 765.11 million shares currently.
The company said it will announce the actual dividend rate and other information about the dividend program upon board approval.
Dell’s total second-quarter revenue was up 15% to $26.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.24, up 17%, and higher than the $2.03 estimate put out by analysts.
The company reiterated its third-quarter guidance of an on-year revenue growth of round 17% at midpoint.
As per the forecast given last month, Dell expects annual adjusted EPS to be between $3.69 and $3.75, up more than 50% on the year.
Dell is spinning off its 81% stake in VMware. The company’s plan will see VMware distribute a special cash dividend of $11.5 billion to $12 billion to all VMware shareholders. Dell will use the proceeds from that to cut its debt.
Dell and VMware will enter into a partnership agreement later with VMware continuing to use Dell Financial Services."

(Reuters) - The National Farmers Union, the nation’s second-largest farm group, said on Wednesday it is launching a campaign to expose the negative effects of consolidation in the agriculture industry on family farms and rural towns.
The campaign, which it said will include a public relations blitz and lobbying, is part of an effort to push Washington to crack down on monopolistic behavior in the industry as lawmakers propose legislation to bring more price and market transparency to highly consolidated farm markets. 
Meat companies have faced scrutiny for their market power, which critics say has allowed them to buy at low prices from small farm suppliers, who have few other options to sell to, and then make big profits on the retail market. 
The Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into alleged price-fixing by big meat companies like Koch Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride, which has resulted in several indictments.
NFU president Rob Larew expressed optimism that the Biden administration would act.
“We have a president who is committed to taking on the challenge of fighting consolidation in agriculture,” Larew said at a press conference launching the campaign.
Democrat Montana Senator Jon Tester and Democrat Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison attended the event. 
In his July executive order on competition, President Joe Biden directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to better enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act, a century-old law regulating meat industry competition. 

The White House also recently attributed higher meat prices to “a lack of competition.” 
The North American Meat Institute, which represents packers who control 95% of U.S. meat processing, denies that packer concentration is related to rising meat prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Thursday that Britain's banks have no major exposures to Evergrande and he does not expect the troubled Chinese property group to ""go badly wrong"".
""The direct exposures of the UK banks and insurance companies to Evergrande are not material, so it's really not a concern in the first round effect,"" Woods told Reuters.
""But the question on everyone's mind is how will the authorities choose to handle this in China, and could it represent something broader? Obviously at some point that could become something that we need to worry about."" 
The BoE has checked exposures of British banks to Evergrande and this year's stress test scenario for Britain's lenders included a ""hard landing"" for the Chinese economy.
""My base case is it won't go badly wrong,"" Woods said.
""I am very cautiously optimistic the Chinese authorities will want to find a way through it that doesn't create a kind of major issue.""
FLASHING AMBER
Evergrande and ""blow ups"" at hedge fund Archegos and finance company Greensill were symptoms of a market getting ahead of itself, Woods said.
""I think we should feel good about how the financial system has come through COVID but of course that's been with huge fiscal and monetary support for the economy that shielded (it) from the full force of the blow,"" he said.
""As we come out, if you look around, financial markets, I would say, are very frothy,"" he added.
Several indicators were now ""flashing amber"" across the world, particularly in the debt and housing markets, with a correction ""clearly possible"".
""It's an environment in which we need to keep our wits about us,"" Woods said.

A steady financial system is needed to support the economic recovery from a pandemic that triggered the worst downturn in Britain in 300 years, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -The crisis at indebted developer China Evergrande Group will not curb Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF)'s appetite for investing in the country, its Chief Financial officer Andy Halford told a banking conference on Thursday.
The Asia, Middle East and Africa-focused lender has no direct exposure to Evergrande and ""negligible"" indirect exposure, he told the conference hosted by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Even if one sector of the Chinese economy is a little under the cosh at the moment, the generality of the growth in the Chinese economy is still very strong when compared with most other parts of the world, and as we look forward it does not dent our enthusiasm for the country,"" he said.
The executive's comments could reassure investors concerned about the potential fallout on British banks, which have invested heavily in China in recent years amid slowing growth in Western markets. 
StanChart has around $6 billion of exposure to real estate in Hong Kong, and $1.25 billion in China out of a global real estate portfolio of some $19 billion, he said.

""We need to be careful that we don't overreact, in this instance we don't have any significant exposure, the overall sectoral exposure is very modest and we're much, much less concerned than the initial market reaction,"" he said.
Halford's comments come after rival lender HSBC's Chief Executive said he expected the crisis to have an impact on capital markets but not his own bank's balance sheet.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, extending Wednesday's gains on growing hopes that China can avoid a messy deleveraging of its real estate sector, and that the Federal Reserve may yet put off tightening monetary policy beyond the end of the year.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 416 points, or 1.2%, at 34,675 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell had hinted at Wednesday's press conference that the process of 'tapering' bond purchases would begin later this year, and be completed by the middle of 2022. However, this week's jobless claims data, which followed a much weaker-than-expected labor market report for August, have encouraged those who believe that the Fed will keep its foot to the floor for a little longer.
Earlier, the U.S. notched 351,000 initial jobless claims last week, more than expected and a second straight weekly increase, suggesting that the Delta-variant Covid-19 surge seen during the summer is finally feeding through into lay-offs. Some analysts noted however that seasonal factors and disruptions from two hurricanes may also have contributed to the uptick. 
Continuing claims also came in above expectations, while IHS Markit's Purchasing Manager Index for the U.S. economy fell by more than expected. While Markit's PMI isn't as closely followed in the U.S. as the Institute of Supply Management's it does point to a clear slowdown in September.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock was the standout performer in early trading, rising 9.5% after the biotech company said it had applied to the World Health Organization, along with its partner the Serum Institute of India, for an emergency use approval of its Covid-19 vaccine. According to the results of a phase-3 trial of the drug published earlier Thursday in the U.K., the vaccine was 89.7% effective in preventing serious illness and no participants who took the drug were admitted to hospital with any side-effects. 
Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock also performed strongly after the business software company raised its revenue forecast for the fiscal 2022 year, ending in January, and guided for revenue growth of over 20% in fiscal 2023. The stock rose 5.0%. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock also rose 1.3% after slightly stronger-than-expected earnings and guidance.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock continued to underperform after its disappointing quarterly update on Tuesday, but the logistics firm appeared to find a short-term bottom, eking out a 0.2% gain. 
Elsewhere,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock rose 2.8% after an upgrade to buy from Guggenheim, citing the advances it is making in the international market.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>",EU court adviser finds car defeat devices broadly illegal,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Software Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) used to alter pollutant emissions based on the temperature and altitude is illegal unless it prevents potentially dangerous sudden damage to the engine, an adviser to the EU's top court said on Thursday.
The finding, if confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), is the latest step in a series of cases following the German carmaker's 2015 admission of wrongdoing in the Dieselgate scandal.
Judges at the CJEU typically follow opinions of the advocate general, but are not bound to.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said the temperature windows used in VW group vehicles was permissible because their their purpose was to prevent sudden and immediate risks of damage to the engine.
The case, brought by consumers in Austria, centres on software controlling a valve that recirculates exhaust gases from the engine outlet. This reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which can cause respiratory problems in humans.
The software shuts off the valve at temperatures outside the range of 15-33 Celsius (59-91 F) and at altitudes above 1,000 metres (3,280 feet), increasing NOx emissions. The consumers contend this is a prohibited defeat device, for which they should be compensated.
In his legal opinion, CJEU advocate general Athanasios Rantos noted the court ruled last December that emissions-rigging software was illegal, even if it contributed to preventing ageing or clogging up of the engine. 
Rantos said the temperature window was not representative of real driving conditions in Austria and neighbouring Germany, as the average temperature was significantly lower than 15 C. Vehicles would also often be driven above 1,000 metres.

The software was a ""defeat device"", he said, and could only be justified if a malfunctioning of the valve had a sudden impact on the engine, such as a power failure while being driven, even if the vehicle undergoes regular maintenance.
The advocate general said that it was for the Austrian courts to determine where the defeat device was necessary. He added that one court had said this was impossible to do.

Hanno Jelden, who prosecutors said was in charge of the development of the illegal software at the heart of the scheme, attributed the long silence over the software malfunction in part to Volkswagen's company culture, which he described as one where problems were to be solved quickly rather than analysed.
Jelden said at an earlier hearing that he informed superiors about the software that sparked the so-called ""Dieselgate"" scandal, but was pressured to keep quiet. 
Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. diesel engine tests, sparking the biggest crisis in its history and costing the carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($37.7 billion) in vehicle refits, fines and legal costs so far.
""I never made a secret out of this function [of the software],"" Jelden said in a courtroom in the city of Braunschweig, where the trial is being held. ""If I had known the legal consequences this could have, I would never have let it happen.""
The company has previously said the software function which ultimately disabled the car's emission filter was designed for another purpose, namely to reduce unpleasant noise from the engine, a defense Jelden repeated on Thursday.
""The function really was developed to improve the acoustics,"" Jelden said, calling the approval process for the function a ""huge mistake.""

The trial of four current and former Volkswagen managers and engineers began last Thursday with all four accused of failing to raise the issue, and instead, seeking to maximise profits for the carmaker and, in turn, their performance bonuses, according to Braunschweig prosecutors.
The defendants either claim they did not know about the manipulation or had informed their superiors about it, judicial sources said.

(Reuters) - Borrowers who apply for ""buy now, pay later"" or other point-of-sale financing tend not to pay down their credit card debts as much as the general population, credit reporting company  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) said on Thursday.
The conclusion, from a new study, indicates that credit card lenders might not have lost as much business as suspected during the pandemic to the rise of ""buy now, pay later"" plans.
""These new forms of financing are growing the credit pie, opening up more opportunities for both consumers and lenders,"" said Liz Pagel, senior vice president of consumer lending at TransUnion.
The study looked at credit profiles of more than 4.5 million people who applied for point-of-sale financing from October 2019 through March.
TransUnion found that a smaller portion of people who applied had reduced their card debt, 54%, compared with 60% of the general population. Some 20% increased their card debt by more than half.
Though financial technology companies have lured shoppers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-consumers-pay-later-idUSKBN2A8036 with the additional ways to borrow, big banks have continued to predict that card lending revenue will increase as card balances rebound from being paid down during coronavirus lockdowns.
The study did not determine how much additional card lending banks lost to ""buy now, pay later.""
In a separate TransUnion survey in August, one-third of people who had used a ""buy now, pay later"" plan said they would have used a credit card had the plan not been available.

Those applying do not appear to be increasing the risk of losses on existing loans, TransUnion said. Delinquency rates on their credit cards six months after their applications were only slightly worse than the general population at 3.2% versus 2.7%.
""It does not look like, at this point, consumers are over leveraging themselves,"" Pagel said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) is focusing its store expansion efforts in China on smaller cities, as demand there has recovered from the pandemic much quicker than that in the country's major centres, its chief executive said on Thursday. 
The owner of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains in China is the country's largest fast food operator with more than 11,000 outlets. Earlier on Thursday, it told an investor day that it was accelerating its store network expansion to reach a 20,000 outlet milestone across 2,700 cities.
The company did not break down how many of the planned new stores are for what it refers to as lower-tier cities.
Yum China's Chief Executive Joey Wat, however, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the company was targeting such areas as their residents had larger disposable incomes versus those of larger cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, and were willing to spend more. 
""The living cost in higher-tier cities is generally greater due to rising housing prices in the past few years, meaning that disposable income is less,"" Wat said. ""Since the pandemic, people in high-tier cities have been more conservative in their spending than lower-tier cities.""
The pandemic has weighed on the company's business even though China has largely contained COVID-19, with the help of Beijing's ""zero-tolerance"" policy that has seen authorities lock down areas deemed high-risk, even when only a handful of cases were detected.
Yum China warned last week that adjusted operating profit would take a 50% to 60% hit in the third quarter as the spread of the Delta variant in China caused more than 500 of its restaurants to temporarily close or only do take-away business.
Consumer habits have also shifted in China during the pandemic and Yum China was launching new products and packaged foods to capture the at-home consumption trend, Wat said. 
For example shoppers can buy two pieces of raw steak from a Pizza Hut online ordering service for 99 yuan.
""Pizza Hut not only sells cooked steak, it sells raw steak,"" Wat said. ""Many people, whatever their age and gender, learned to cook during their stay-at-home days.""

385,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 09:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Big Tech targeted by U.S. and EU in draft memo ahead of tech and trade meeting,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and European Union plan to take a more unified approach to limit the growing market power of Big Tech companies, according to a draft memo seen by Reuters.
The move will be among announcements on tech, climate, trade and supply chains likely to be made at a U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council meeting on Sept. 29 in Pittsburgh. 
With the U.S. and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), such cooperation has become critically important for regulators on both sides of the Atlantic - and would make it harder for the U.S. tech industry to fight new rules. 
This month, the White House announced that the council would meet for the first time on Sept. 29 in Pittsburgh. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and the European Union's trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis are scheduled to attend along with European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager. 
The White House, which is coordinating with different agencies on the meeting, declined to comment on the memo. Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The council has 10 working groups for areas such as strengthening trade, economic relations and shared democratic values, according to the draft memo.
The group focused on tech company regulation will ""exchange information on our respective approaches to technology platform governance, seeking convergence where feasible,"" the memo says.
There are many examples where the two continents could cooperate more. Google, which faces several antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. related to its advertising business, also faces a wide-ranging investigation related to ad technology in the EU.
""We have identified common issues of concern around gatekeeper power by major platforms and the responsibility of online intermediaries,"" the memo says, adding that more can be done to combat misinformation.
""This includes in particular the responsibility of online intermediaries to safeguard democratic processes from the impact of their business activities. Areas of common ground... include content moderation and fair competition,"" the memo said.
The group will tackle areas such as hate speech, algorithmic amplification and data access for researchers, the memo says.
The council's climate and clean tech group will work to identify trade and investment opportunities in low- and zero-carbon technologies and products, according to the memo. The supply chain working group will focus on securing supplies of pharmaceuticals, critical minerals and clean energy.
The council will also work to address the shortage of semiconductor chips in a way that is ""balanced and of equal interest for both parties"" and will avoid a ""subsidy race."" 
On Wednesday, Reuters reported that European Union ambassadors have postponed discussions to prepare for the meeting in protest of Washington's submarine agreement with Australia at France's expense. https://reut.rs/2W2FTbw
A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said preparations for the meeting were continuing. 

Several tech trade groups in Washington said the industry does not want the European approach to digital regulation to be adopted in the United States.""The risk is that the European side will press the United States to harmonize its regulations with the EU by taking a precautionary approach... which would skewer America's leading tech companies,"" said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech think tank based in Washington.
""We shouldn't do that, nor do we need to. Our interests are broadly aligned and compatible, particularly when it comes to China,"" Atkinson said.

Investing.com –  Roku  stock (NASDAQ:ROKU) traded 3% higher in Thursday’s premarket on getting an upgrade from Guggenheim to ‘buy’.
Putting a tag of $395 on the stock, Guggenheim’s Michael Morris cited strength in the advertising market and rising comfort with impression-based advertising as factors behind his optimism. The target price translates into an upside of nearly 22% from the stock’s Wednesday close.
According to the analyst, the company’s bolstering of its original content is also likely to attract advertisers.
Morris also placed his confidence in the company’s international expansion, saying this would expand its total addressable market. Earlier this month, Roku said it plans to market streaming devices in Germany this year.
As per Morris, incremental market launches should get easier as key large markets are established.
The analyst also expects Roku’s acquisition of Nielsen’s advanced video advertising business to position it strongly in assessing viewer behavior.

Since the beginning of this year, Tesla and Samsung have discussed chip design multiple times and exchanged chip prototypes for Tesla's upcoming Hardware 4 self-driving computer, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing sources with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Samsung declined to comment. Tesla did not have an immediate response. 
If Samsung wins the order, it is expected to make the chip on its 7-nanometre production process, the report said. Samsung already produces chips in Tesla's current Hardware 3 computers.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-unveils-own-chip-ai-training-computer-dojo-2021-08-20 in the company's AI Day event in August that Tesla would introduce new hardware for its self-driving computer for its Cybertruck electric pick-up truck in ""about a year or so."" 
In the chip contract manufacturing industry, Samsung is second to TSMC which had 52.9% of market share compared to Samsung's 17.3% as of end-June, according to analysis provider TrendForce.

Gridspertise will manage all activities related to digital meters and intelligent grid services to help its clients deal with the increasing amounts of power generated from intermittent renewable energy sources.
The spinoff will mainly target markets in Europe and Latin America, where Enel already has extensive business, but will also look to expand in North America and Asia-Pacific.
Europe's biggest utility manages power distribution grids in eight countries in Latin America and Europe with around 74.8 million end users. More than 40% of its core earnings came from networks last year.
""The company will help electricity distribution companies of any size and geography roll-out integrated smart grid solutions to meet the evolving needs of grid users and electricity end-customers,"" Gridspertise CEO Robert Denda said in a statement.
Governments around the world are seeking to improve the digital resilience of their distribution networks as they tackle the climate crisis by using more electricity for energy.
Earlier this year Enel said it was setting up a company to offer digital grids services.

On Thursday Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said Gridspertise aimed to have 1.5 billion euro ($1.8 billion) sales by 2030 and could sell a minority stake in its capital to investors.

(Reuters) - Nearly four in five electronics manufacturers say that it has become harder to find qualified workers, compounding problems from an ongoing chip shortage and causing delays in shipping products, a trade group representing them said on Thursday.
IPC, which represents contract manufacturers such Foxconn, chipmakers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), circuit board makers and other industry players, said about 80% of respondents in its most recent survey said they were having trouble finding workers. More than two-thirds of the companies surveyed said that their labor costs were also rising.
The labor woes come at a time when the industry is also dealing with a global chip shortage that started last year. More than half of the respondents said they did not believe the chip shortage would abate until at least the second half of 2022, with 90% of the companies saying their overall materials costs, which also include non-chip items, were rising.
The result had been increased delays and shrinking profit margins, the survey said. Less than a quarter of the companies surveyed said their profits were growing, with nearly a third saying they expected margins to shrink. And some 88% of companies said their lead times - the delay between receiving an order and fulfilling it - was going up, sometimes to as long as two months.

Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at IPC and lead researcher on the study, said the labor shortages were worst in North America and Europe, and electronics manufacturers would likely have to go beyond raising wages, which 44% said they were doing, to attract workers. More than a third of companies said they were providing more flexible hours or additional training and education. 
""That becomes an important thing in manufacturing sectors. It won't be just higher wages. It will also be, 'We're going to train you. If there's other education aspirations that you have, we'll work to help you with that,'"" DuBravac said.

The move has been characterised as ""getting ready for the possible storm"" by the officials, according to the report.
The officials said local-level government agencies and state-owned enterprises have been instructed to step in only at the last minute should Evergrande fail to manage its affairs in an orderly fashion, the WSJ reported.
Local governments have been tasked with preventing unrest and mitigating the ripple effect on home buyers and the broader economy, the officials said, according to the report.
Evergrande, China's second-biggest property developer, has $83.5 million in dollar-bond interest payments due on Thursday on a $2 billion offshore bond and a $47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment due next week.
Both bonds would default if Evergrande fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates.

The company, which epitomised the borrow-to-build business model, ran into trouble over the past few months as Beijing tightened rules in its property sector to rein back debt levels and speculation.
Investors are worried that a downfall could spread to creditors including banks in China and abroad.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 07:32AM ET</span>","Supply chain snarls could cost automakers $210 billion this year, forecast finds","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Global automakers could lose $210 billion in revenue this year because of supply chain disruptions, nearly double a forecast earlier this year, consulting firm Alixpartners said Thursday.
A shortage of semiconductors is just part of the problem, Alixpartners said in a new forecast. High prices and tight supplies of commodities such as steel and plastic resin are driving up costs and forcing automakers to curtail production.
Automakers are on track to lose production of 7.7 million vehicles in 2021, according to the new forecast. Alixpartners advises automakers on supply chain and other issues.
In May, the firm predicted automakers would lose $110 billion in revenue and fall 3.9 million vehicles short of production plans for the year.
The dour new forecast comes amid warnings from automakers and commercial truck manufacturers that semiconductor shortages and commodity price spikes are not easing as 2021 heads into its final months, as industry executives had hoped they would.
Last week, IHS Markit slashed its global auto industry production outlook for 2021 and 2022.
In the U.S. market, vehicle sales have begun to slow because inventories on dealer lots are around 20 days' supply, less than half the normal levels, said Dan Hearsch, a managing director in Alixpartners auto practice.
""We had originally assumed we would get back to normal and claw back volume"" in the fourth quarter, Hearsch told Reuters. ""That is not going to happen.""
Instead, automakers could have tight inventories until late 2022 or early 2023, he said.
Supplies of semiconductors have been hit in the past few months by a COVID surge in Malaysia https://www.reuters.com/technology/malaysian-chip-makers-still-struggling-meet-demand-association-says-2021-08-26, which has hobbled production at important suppliers.
Backlogs at major U.S. ports are hampering efforts by auto manufacturers to import more plastic resins and steel, he said.

In response, automakers are committing to longer contracts to lock in supplies, buying as much as 40 to 50 weeks in advance, Hearsch said.
""They are signing up for things they would never have done a year ago,"" he said.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",U.S. 'pink sheets' in shakeup as securities regulator looks to stamp out fraud,"By Michelle Price and John McCrank
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As many as 2,000 companies could disappear from the off-exchange ""pink sheets,"" long a favorite of retail investors, when a new rule aimed at stamping out fraud in this notoriously risky enclave of U.S. equities markets comes into effect next week. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule boosts investor disclosures by requiring off-exchange issuers, frequently penny-stock companies that do not meet the main exchanges' listing standards, to make accurate, up-to-date financial information publicly available. 
Due to a loophole in the current rules, around 2,000 of the roughly 11,000 companies quoted on the Pink Market operated by New York-based OTC Markets Group do not publicly provide such information. 
OTC Markets has been trying to spread the word and encourage companies to get their paperwork in order, but it was still unclear how many would do so in time for the Sept. 28 deadline, if at all, said Daniel Zinn, the company's general counsel. 
The market operator may have to remove, if only temporarily, between 1,000 and 2,000 stocks from the Pink Market, he estimated, meaning broker quotes will no longer be available to investors via online retail broker platforms. 
The shakeup, which comes amid a boom in retail trading, has led some brokers including Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity to bar new purchases in affected stocks, causing consternation among retail investors unsure of whether to bail out or stay the course in the hopes that the companies comply.
While customers will be still able to sell their shares after Sept. 28, brokers have warned of severely limited liquidity, which usually means investors get a bad deal. Investors still keen to dabble in companies that have not complied may have to call up their broker for a quote. 
The rule will also apply to some government and corporate bond issuers, leading industry lobby groups to warn this week of potential disruption to that critical funding market. 
Overall, the new rule is likely to increase the cost of trading these companies, said Zinn. 
""We're in agreement with the SEC's goals of providing as much disclosure as possible,"" said Zinn. Some companies, however, prefer not to provide public financial data for a number of legitimate reasons, or may be unable to, he continued. 
For example, some companies may not want to incur the legal cost of providing compliant paperwork, while others may not want to promote trading in their stock.
""In those circumstances, no quotes at all may lead to more harm than help for existing investors,"" said Zinn. 
The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.
The Pink Market is home to an array of issuers, including reputable foreign companies seeking a gateway to the United States. But some are highly risky and volatile penny-stock companies in distress, delinquency or which are simply shells. 
The SEC has warned that the off-exchange market, more broadly, is rife with fraud and manipulation. 
Under the SEC's previous rules, broker-dealers had to review a company's financials before providing quotes in its stock on the Pink Market, unless another broker-dealer had already vetted them. That was the case even if the initial review happened years ago and the company had since stopped publishing financial information. The new SEC rule ends that exemption.
""Companies are on notice to provide a certain level of transparency for their investors or they can't be easily quoted. That's a good thing,"" said Georgetown University professor Jim Angel. ""The problem is what about the companies that choose not to disclose? Their shareholders are being punished for the actions of the companies."" 
'SHOW ME THE MONEY'
A new wave of amateur investors has piled in to penny stocks over the past 18 months, trading on low or no-fee retail broker platforms and hyping up their positions on social media. 
In August, there were 601.1 billion transactions https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q3K2z/2 on penny stock markets tracked by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a 130% jump compared with a year earlier, but down from a peak of 1.9 trillion transactions in February.
Of the stocks affected by the new rule, the most popular among investors in trading forums like Stocktwits and WallStreetBets include the shell companies liquidating defunct retailers Blockbuster and Sears. 
China's  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc, which last year de-listed from the Nasdaq following an accounting scandal, is among the most actively traded on the broader Pink Market, OTC Markets data shows.
Worried by broker warnings and blaming a decline in their stock holdings on the impending rule change, some retail investors have taken to social media to share their anxiety and glean gossip as to whether companies will comply in time. 
Executives from several affected companies have reassured investors on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the paperwork is coming. For some thrill-seekers, those pledges are another buying opportunity. 

""Let's go, last day to buy,"" one Stocktwits user going by the handle LASPit wrote on Aug. 27 before their broker began restricting purchases in cannabis producer CannTrust Holdings (TSX:TRST) Inc, which is mired in a legal battle over regulatory issues.
""We are all in it till the bitter end now, no turning back! ... Please show me the money at the end of this!"" a user with the handle gottamakedatmoney replied.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) expects to decide in early October on the possible use of a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
It will be the EU drugs regulator's first decision on boosters, the source said, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized a third dose of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) for those 65 and older, all people at high risk of severe disease, and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
""EMA's decision on the third dose of Pfizer is expected for the beginning of October,"" the source said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Pfizer declined to comment, while BioNTech was not immediately available for comment.
The EU regulator said on Sept. 6 it had begun its evaluation of data submitted by Pfizer and BioNTech for a booster dose to be given six months after the second dose in people 16 years of age and older.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is also expected to submit data to the EMA this month on its booster dose, an EU document said.
In an opinion issued in early September and republished by the EMA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said there was no urgent need to administer booster doses to fully vaccinated individuals in the general population.
But it also noted that additional doses should already be considered for people with severely weakened immune systems as part of their primary vaccination.
Many EU states have already decided to administer a booster dose despite facing higher legal risks without a formal decision to do so by the EMA.
The EU has signed three deals with Pfizer and BioNTech for a total of 2.4 billion doses. 
The latest contract covers the supply of at least 900 million shots, a large part of which is likely to be needed only if boosters are considered necessary, or if new virus variants emerge against which existing vaccination is not effective.

Over 70% of the EU's adult population has already been fully vaccinated, and the bloc has secured an ample supply of vaccines from several manufacturers.
The ECDC has said crucial data on the need and safety of boosters are still missing, in part because it is not yet fully clear how long vaccines protect against the virus.

The major U.S. indices posted large gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve delayed the start of the withdrawal of its monetary stimulus until nearer the end of the year, while keeping its interest rates unchanged.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained well over 300 points, or 1%, its best day since July 20. The broad-based S&P 500 also rose 1%, posting its best day since July 23, while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite similarly finished the session 1% higher.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 06:18AM ET</span>",China Tells Evergrande to Avoid Near-Term Default on Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial regulators in Beijing issued a broad set of instructions to China Evergrande Group, telling the embattled developer to focus on completing unfinished properties and repaying individual investors while avoiding a near-term default on dollar bonds.
In a recent meeting with Evergrande representatives, regulators said the company should communicate proactively with bondholders to avoid a default but didn’t give more specific guidance, a person familiar with the matter said. The developer has an $83.5 million coupon due Thursday, with a 30-day grace period to make the payment.
There’s no indication that regulators offered financial support to Evergrande for the bond payment, and it’s unclear whether officials believe the company should eventually impose losses on offshore creditors. Policy makers are trying to learn more about who holds Evergrande’s bonds, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive information.
While the regulatory guidance offers few clues about what an Evergrande endgame might look like, it does suggest China’s government wants to avoid an imminent collapse of the developer that might roil financial markets and drag down economic growth. Any sign that Beijing is taking steps to give Evergrande more time to manage its debt problems could calm investor nerves in China and around the world. 
Fears of an Evergrande failure have caused a sharp rise in borrowing costs for other junk-rated Chinese developers and cast doubt on the health of some smaller Chinese banks. Individual investors, homebuyers and suppliers have staged protests at Evergrande offices across the country, while markets from Hong Kong to New York have convulsed this week as traders weighed the prospect of financial contagion from the world’s most indebted developer.
Even though Evergrande’s crisis can be traced in part to President Xi Jinping’s campaign to rein in over-leveraged property companies and discourage moral hazard, his government is unlikely to welcome a messy default that could threaten economic and social stability. Large cash injections into the financial system by the People’s Bank of China in recent days suggest policy makers are already focused on shoring up sentiment.
Evergrande, the PBOC and the nation’s financial and housing regulators didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Speculation that Evergrande may avoid a worst-case scenario helped lift its bonds and stock on Thursday. The company’s 8.25% dollar note due 2022 climbed 4.8 cents on the dollar to 30 cents as of 5:39 p.m. local time, hitting session highs after Bloomberg reported regulators’ instructions to Evergrande. The bonds are still pricing in expectations of a deep haircut, but not quite as extreme as earlier this week. Shares jumped 18% in Hong Kong before the Bloomberg report, paring this year’s loss to 82%.
The rally was fueled in part by a vaguely worded statement from Evergrande on Wednesday, in which the company said an interest payment on one of its yuan-denominated bonds had been “resolved via negotiations off the clearing house.” The developer likely struck a deal with local bondholders to postpone the payment without having to label the move a default, analysts said.
It’s unclear whether Evergrande would be able to pull off something similar for its dollar bonds. While some of the notes are likely owned by billionaire founder Hui Ka Yan and his associates, holders also include global investment firms that might be less willing to go along with opaque payment arrangements.
Deeply discounted prices for Evergrande dollar bonds suggest investors view a restructuring of some kind as all but inevitable. Offshore bondholders are widely seen as near the bottom of Beijing’s priority list of Evergrande creditors, though that assessment may depend in part on how worried authorities become about Chinese companies’ access to dollar funding. The turmoil at Evergrande, Asia’s biggest issuer of junk bonds, has sent yields on an index of junk-grade Chinese dollar bonds to a decade high.
In a meeting with Evergrande employees on Wednesday, Hui emphasized the importance of resuming construction on unfinished properties, according to Jiemian, a Chinese media outlet. He also said Evergrande will ensure repayment of investment products.
Property sales are a key source of cash for Evergrande, though the company has struggled to attract buyers in recent months amid waning confidence in its ability to deliver on projects. Homebuyers in China often have to make large down payments on properties that may take years to complete. About 1.5 million buyers are currently waiting for Evergrande to deliver unfinished homes.
The company is also trying to offload assets to raise cash, with mixed success. It said earlier this month it hadn’t made material progress on plans to sell stakes in its electric-car and property services units. Evergrande has hired Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and Admiralty Harbour Capital to “explore all feasible solutions” to ease its liquidity problems.
While the developer doesn’t have any bonds maturing until 2022, it faces about $669 million in coupon payments this year. The bulk of its $300 billion-plus in total liabilities are to homebuyers, suppliers and local financial institutions.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) was attempting to bounce back Thursday after its warning of damage from changes to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy rules led to a 4% drop in its price in the previous session.
The stock was up 1.0% in premarket trading.
Facebook Vice President of Marketing Graham Mudd’s comments that the company is likely understating the effectiveness of its advertising on Apple devices, steering against the company's previous admission that new privacy features built into the iOS operating system would limit their effectiveness. 
Mudd said, Facebook is underreporting web conversions, a metric of advertising impacts, on iOS by about 15%.
The update to Apple's privacy policy, rolled out in the June quarter, make it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for ad targeting. Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehne had in July said the impact of Apple’s tweaks would be felt at the social media giant in the ongoing quarter.
Mudd reiterated those concerns in a blog post Wednesday and acknowledged that it might have become more expensive for advertisers on the platform. He said measuring the impact of those campaigns has also become more challenging. 
The Facebook VP went on to suggest ‘best practices’ to advertisers to get more out of their spending. He said the company will introduce new tools to further help with delivery effectiveness and measurement.
Industry surveys have repeatedly shown that Facebook overstates the effectiveness of its ad targeting tools to advertisers. That hasn't stopped it building and defending an effective duopoly in the online advertising business with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, however."

The deal is subject to regulatory approval and its closing is expected in the first half of 2022, Amissima said in a statement, without giving financial details.
Athora Holding, which has 79 billion euros of assets under administration, is a specialised life insurance group focused on Europe.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) traded 1% higher in Thursday’s premarket following the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of booster shots of its Covid-19 vaccine for people at higher risk of infection.
This means that people 65 years and older and vulnerable individuals at risk of catching the illness will be able to get a third shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. The two companies developed the vaccine jointly and share the revenue from the vaccine sales equally.
Patients should receive a booster at least six months after taking the second dose, the FDA said.
The need for a booster dose after studies indicated the efficacy of the two-dose vaccine declined after a certain period and that a third dose will help. The Delta variant of the original coronavirus that led to a resurgence of the pandemic in the U.S. and in other parts of the world this year was largely responsible for convincing the authorities of the need for a booster.
The Biden administration wanted a blanket approval for the booster to cover all adults but FDA advisors and experts advised against it.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's upcoming national election is likely to show the most fragmented outcome in decades and markets could struggle to work out the implications for stocks, with one exception: if you score low on green technology you face trouble.
Analysts say the pro-environment Greens have a good chance of being part of any future government following the Sept. 26 vote, raising the chance of more ambitious targets for solar and wind power and increased pressure to cut emissions.
Already investors are focused on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues in picking stocks, including in Germany, which has outlined plans to exit coal and nuclear.
""The upcoming German elections will have significant implications for ESG-related policies, affecting corporates and investors,"" JP Morgan analysts said, singling out stocks with high CO2 emissions as potentially exposed.
This includes steelmakers Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Salzgitter, Germany's two biggest steelmakers, as well as chemicals giant BASF and potash and salt miner K+S, the brokerage said.
DZ Bank analyst Christian Kahler also saw polluters, such as HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), the world's second-largest cement maker, and carrier Lufthansa, as challenged if emissions targets are tightened further.
In addition, there are concerns over what a stricter approach to emissions could mean for Germany's mainstay car sector, which includes Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), BMW and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
""Traders may be especially worried about the outlook for Volkswagen, which has a checkered environmental track record dating back to the emissions scandal in 2015,"" Matt Weller, global head of research at FOREX.com and City Index said.
For investors in German energy stocks, which include wind turbine maker Nordex and project developer Encavis, the message is different given Germany's shift from fossil fuels to increased use of renewables.
This also holds true for RWE - one of Europe's largest renewables players - and energy networks operator E.ON,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Wanda Serwinowska said.
Describing the election as ""a major catalyst for Germany's utilities, given the expected focus on energy transition"", she said RWE could outperform E.ON for the rest of the year. E.ON shares are up a fifth year-to-date, while RWE is down 8%.
Meantime, residential stocks are a sector that could come under pressure if a more left-leaning government runs the country.
Although it should be clear within hours of the polls closing on Sept. 26 how the various parties have fared, it could take months of coalition talks to work out who the next chancellor will be and the make-up of the government as polls suggest no one party will come close to a majority.
Were the Social Democrats to enter a coalition with the Greens and the Left Party, there is a risk that rent controls would be tightened noticeably, Bernstein analysts wrote.

Rents are hotly debated in Germany, where housing prices have soared in recent years, and fears of further increases also played a big role when Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen (OTC:DTCWY) unveiled plans to merge in May.
""But even such a leftist alliance would probably not go as far as introducing a Berlin-style rent freeze for major cities on the national level,"" they said.

Private banking was seeing ""very strong business volumes"", while the corporate bank was on track to provide a ""step-off point"" at the end of this year that would support achieving its objectives in 2022.
The investment bank had gained market share, with customers returning after ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) upgraded Deutsche last month, said von Moltke. Investment banking revenue is seen this year at 9.3 billion euros, in line with last year.

The bank embarked on a restructuring in 2019, closing some businesses and shedding thousands of staff in an effort to return to profitability. In 2020, the bank posted its first full-year profit since 2014.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia accused Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday of uncompetitive behaviour over control of payments on its phones, which have grown to about a third of all in-person payments the country's largest lender processes.
Matt Comyn, chief executive at the Sydney-based bank, urged lawmakers to boost scrutiny of technology giants, saying payments through digital wallets developed by Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google made up about 45% of all physical consumer payments, as distinct from other payments such as online or direct debits.
""The ... claim that Apple is pro-competition, I think, is a fair statement, as long as one accepts that competition is welcome as long as no one can compete with Apple,"" Comyn told a regular parliamentary committee.
The bank has been calling for Apple to free up the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip on its phones for the use of banks' own apps, estimating the U.S. firm captures 80% of all contactless transactions done through smartphones and smartwatches. 
Contactless payments are growing fast in Australia, fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic and mobile payment services such as Apple Pay, and Comyn estimated customers tap more than 90% of their transactions.
Apple, which requires banks to process all contactless payments through its digital wallet and pay an undisclosed fee, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
""It is analogous to imagine a world today where, on your Apple phone, the only person that could determine which carrier you used is Apple,"" Comyn said.
Shayne Elliott, chief executive of fourth-biggest lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, which was the first in the country to link Apple Pay with credit cards, said it had not been focused on the issue up ""until that particular complaint"".
""It's kind of ironic, one of Australia's biggest companies complaining about having to deal with other big competitors,"" Elliott told the parliamentary committee.
Last month, Apple told a senate inquiry its payments app was ""pro-competitive"", and accused companies urging further scrutiny of its products of doing so ""for their own commercial gain"".
The inquiry findings have not been published. 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which has been reviewing whether Apple breached competition laws, declined to comment on Thursday.
Its chief, Rod Sims, told the Australian Financial Review newspaper last week that the issue was complex and the anti-trust agency was ""going into this with an open mind"".
Unlike Apple, search giant Google allows banks and other third parties to access its NFC chip.
The inquiry comes amid intensifying scrutiny from global regulators over Apple and Google's dominance in the mobile market. 

South Korea approved a bill last month that bans major app store operators, including Apple, from forcing software developers to use their payment systems.

LONDON (Reuters) - European energy firms Centrica (OTC:CPYYY) and Galp, food group Nestle and watchmaker Swatch are among 50 companies worldwide that are highly exposed to physical climate risks, investors with $10 trillion in assets said on Thursday.
The companies, which are involved in energy and mining, food, pharmaceuticals or technology manufacturing or transport and utilities, are more exposed to issues such as flooding than other companies in their sector and region, the Institutional Investors Group On Climate Change (IIGCC) said.
In a letter to the European, Asian and U.S. companies from more than 50 IIGCC members, the investors asked the firms to identify properly and respond to events such as flooding, droughts and extreme heat.
The IIGCC also published a set of expectations for all companies on building resilience to physical climate change risks, including scenario testing and reporting against a set of risk metrics.
Companies have come under pressure from activists and investors to cut their carbon emissions, with Shell (LON:RDSa) planning to appeal a landmark ruling on the issue.
But physical risks to a business can be overlooked, said Marion Maloney, Head of Responsible Investment & Governance at Britain's Environment Agency Pension Fund.
""We think that are there two parts to the climate change debate - often the physical risks element is the poor cousin that doesn't get enough attention,"" she said. 
""I want every company in my portfolio to be looking at these expectations."" 
Other investors signing the letter included AustralianSuper, Impax Asset Management and Lombard Odier.
Centrica , which owns British Gas, one of the biggest energy suppliers in Britain, said it was ""assessing both physical and transitional risks and opportunities we may face across a number of climate scenarios"" and was ""increasing our disclosures on the outputs from the analysis in line with best practice"".
Switzerland's Nestle  said it was ""already undertaking scenario analysis to assess physical impacts on our value chain over a longer time horizon"", adding this would ""provide direction for our mitigation and adaptation actions across our raw material sourcing and operational footprints"".
Portugal's Galp Energia said it is committed to being a leader in the quality, accuracy and transparency of the information it provides to investors and other stakeholders.
""This year, we also concluded an evaluation of climate risks and opportunities, including physical and transition, that may impact Galp’s expected portfolio by 2025, 2030 and 2050,"" Galp added.
Switzerland's Swatch declined to comment.
The investor initiative comes ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Scotland in November, where governments are being urged to accelerate their efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

It follows the release of a landmark United Nations climate report in August warning that global warming was dangerously close to running out of control.
The companies were identified based on research by the IIGCC and climate risk data firm Four Twenty Seven.

Germany's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic lost momentum in September, with its flash Purchasing Managers' Index showing growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to an eight-month low reading of 58.5 from 62.6 in August.
There was a similar story in France, as the country’s preliminary composite Purchasing Managers Index - factoring in both the services and manufacturing sectors - fell to 55.1 points in September from 55.9 in August.
Later in the session, the Bank of England announces its latest monetary policy decision later in the session, but the central bank is not expected to change its record-low interest rates or the extent of its asset purchases. The central bank of Norway, however, raised its key rate to 0.25%, becoming the first major advanced economy to do so since the pandemic. Turkey's central bank also meets later.
Global sentiment had improved following the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, when the U.S. central bank indicated that it will likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases towards the end of this year. That was a positive surprise for the minority who had expected an immediate start to the withdrawal of the stimulus that has been supporting the economy during the pandemic.
Also helping the tone were solid gains in Chinese markets Thursday, after the People’s Bank of China injected more money into the banking system, easing concerns about the fallout from China Evergrande's debt crisis. 
In corporate news,  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) stock dropped 0.7% after the group warned about rising costs while reporting a 9% fall in total parcel deliveries by volume across July and August. 
French car parts company  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) stock rose 6.7% even as it lowered its main 2021 financial targets due to a sharp reduction in worldwide automotive production on the back of a semiconductor chip shortage.
Crude prices edged higher Thursday, supported by another decline in U.S. oil stocks as production in the important Gulf of Mexico region remained hampered by the damage caused by two recent hurricanes, while U.S. crude stockpiles fell to a three-year low.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",Marketmind: E-Day and central banks galore,"A look at the day ahead from Karin Strohecker.
It's deadline day for China's embattled property giant  Evergrande  , labouring under a $305 billion mountain of debt, to pay its coupon on a dollar bond or career towards default - a prospect that has sent chills through markets.
Whether or not the payment is made, few harbour hopes that China's overextended property sector - a dominant force in Asia's corporate bond market - will escape disruption. In turn the hit to the country's financial system, commodity imports and economic growth is bound to be felt globally.
And there's little solace to be had from a more hawkish Fed, likely beginning to trim its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. At the end of two-day meeting on Wednesday, the Fed also signalled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected as its turn from pandemic crisis policies gains momentum.
Autumn storm clouds are also gathering elsewhere with the U.S. debt ceiling nearing and the flu season approaching fast in many parts of the world.
But for today, optimism prevails.
Evergrande (HK:3333) shares rose as much as 32% in Hong Kong after its chairman sought to reassure retail investors, many Asian markets are trending higher. Both European and U.S. stocks futures point to cautious gains with crude oil futures rising and the dollar taking a breather.
The central banking marathon continues with policy makers in the U.K., Switzerland, South Africa, Turkey and Norway all due to give their verdict. Norway is set to become the first major western central bank to deliver post-pandemic rate hikes.
Data on PMIs coming in from around the globe meanwhile should give markets more hints to gauge the economic trajectory ahead.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday:
- Evergrande seeks to reassure retail investors as key debt deadline looms
- Central banks: Norway, UK, Switzerland, South Africa, Turkey, Taiwan, Philippines
- Bank of England expected to keep rates steady as inflation risks mount
- Fed issues quarterly accounts

- U.S. weekly initial jobless claims
- Auctions: US 4 week bills, 10-yr TIPS

Faurecia noted IHS Markit now estimated worldwide car production at 72 million vehicles this year versus 76.8 million previously, adding this sharp reduction was primarily attributable to a higher than expected impact from semiconductor shortages.
""Faurecia's financial guidance for 2021 was explicitly based on the assumption of 76.6 million vehicles produced in the full year"", the company said.
Based on this new assumption of a 72-million global car production, Faurecia now sees full year sales of 15.5 billion euros ($18.2 billion) versus a previous target 16.5 billion.
The group, which won a bidding tussle to take control of German lighting group Hella last month, says its 2021 operating margin will range from 6.0% and 6.2% versus a previous guidance of 7%.
Faurecia's net cash flow target, which the group had upgraded at the end of July, was also lowered, to around 500 million euros versus a previous target of a total exceeding that figure.

""The revised 2021 guidance, adjusted to reflect the sharp reduction in worldwide automotive production to 72 million vehicles in FY 2021, confirms Faurecia's strong operating leverage and effectiveness of resilience actions,"" Faurecia said.

Momenta is among the few companies that hold a permit for gathering high-definition maps in China, a key tool in autonomous driving technologies. It is working with automakers to develop mass-production vehicles with self-driving functions to gather real-time data.
The company is also backed by SAIC Motor, GM's main Chinese partner, as well as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).
""Customers in China are embracing electrification and advanced self-driving technology faster than anywhere else in the world, and the agreement between GM and Momenta will accelerate our deployment of next-generation solutions tailor-made for our consumers in China,"" said Julian Blissett, GM's China chief.
The U.S. automaker said in June it would spend $35 billion through 2025 on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies globally. Earlier this month, its venture capital arm invested in Oculii, a U.S. maker of software for radar sensors used in self-driving cars.

Automakers and technology firms are investing billions of dollars in autonomous driving, aiming to take an early lead in what many consider the future of mobility. 
Other global automakers have tie-ups with Chinese firms in the nascent technology. Toyota is testing vehicles with Pony.ai, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor works with WeRide, while Honda has teamed up with AutoX.

CARLOS CASANOVA, senior economist for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee, Hong Kong
""In my opinion it shows they are closer to reaching an agreement with the government as to how they should go about this managed restructuring.
""Wealth management products are important for two reasons. Of course it's a grey area and so we don't have visibility as to how big the risks could be in that sphere. But more importantly it has translated into quite a bit of social unrest. We've seen protesters gathering outside of Evergrande's headquarters over the past couple of months over unpaid wealth management products.
""And so while it's by no means the government's goal to send a message that returns on wealth management products are guaranteed ... it is important from a social stability standpoint to make sure that Chinese retail investors get their money back and that homebuyers get their homes delivered.
""So in my opinion it signals they are closer to being in a position where they have an agreement about how they should manage the situation.""
EZIEN HOO, credit analyst at OCBC Bank in Singapore
""We think there are two parts to this: One, the nature of investors and, two, how far the investors sit from the assets.
""Assuming this situation goes the way of a debt restructuring ... we think the retail investor nature of the wealth management products (WMP) would be prioritised for social stability.
""This is especially more so as we understand that the media had reported that WMP investors also consist of employees of the company. In our view, this would be despite of the actual legal standing of the WMPs. It is still unclear to us on the exact terms of such products (for example: whether such products are outright guaranteed by Evergande's development projects). We did not find much disclosures on the WMPs in the company's consolidated audited financials.
""With regards to the bonds denominated in dollars (presumably this is what foreign bondholders mostly are invested in), dollar bonds are issued out of offshore entities who sit further away from the assets located in China and would be subordinated to lenders onshore. Being far from assets would mean lower bargaining power versus other lenders closer to the assets, especially lenders who have direct claims on assets.
""Aside from this, we would imagine many of the holders of the dollar-bonds are institutional funds and exchange traded funds that are managed by sophisticated investors, where matters at Evergrande leading up to its current bout of liquidity stress has been well telegraphed for at least a few months now.""
WEI-LIANG CHANG, macro strategist at DBS Bank in Singapore
""Wealth management products are marketed to retail investors, and there is likely political pressure on the company to ensure a fair settlement. On the other hand, professional investors in the bonds are expected to have done their due diligence, and thus see no special treatment. 
""The priority of creditors in a restructure should not be impacted, and will depend on the legal clauses on the bonds and wealth products.""
BERND HARTMANN, Head CIO Office at boutique private bank VP Bank
""China's political leadership is likely to be aware of the seriousness of the situation. The aim could be to break up the Evergrande Group. Evergrande is already selling its good bits. In this way, the government is continuing on its already chosen path of breaking up monopoly structures in the real estate market as well.
""We assume that the Chinese leadership will intervene, but attention will be paid to the exact form it takes. The authorities will try to prevent a spillover into other sectors by breaking up Evergrande to release liquidity. At the same time, Beijing is likely to try to protect private property buyers who have already paid for their flats and are making mortgage payments but are waiting for completion. The government is thus likely to ensure the completion of real estate projects.
""A sale to private companies has already failed. It is conceivable that interventions will be made through the Guangdong provincial government instead of the central government. The greatest damage would thus fall on the creditors.
""A major impact would be a long and severe slump in property prices and sales. This must be averted. In the short term, China could deviate from its actual course of cooling the real estate market through stricter lending.""
LONG CHEN, partner at Plenum, an independent research platform, in Beijing
""China has experienced several high-profile bank failures and corporate bankruptcies over the past three years. The financial risks from Evergrande do not look much bigger than those in the failure of Baoshang Bank or HNA. Evergrande's dollar bond is trading at below 30c so it is not a surprise at all to see a default.
""The difference this time is that Evergrande owes 600,000 apartments to the buyers with a total value of 200 billion yuan ($30.94 billion), and over 600 billion yuan to the construction firms and suppliers.
""The top task is to get the apartments built, and the government has multiple options to get that done. It is equally important to avoid a nationwide property collapse and that requires a shift of policies, which are too hawkish at the moment.

""Nobody is interested in bailing out Evergrande but nobody wants a crisis either. The moment Evergrande falls, the easier it will be for Beijing to ease policies. To put it this way: it will be more like a 'whatever it takes' moment rather than a 'Lehman moment'. The market will feel more pains before that, but not after.""

419,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 02:26AM ET</span>","Intel, Apple, carmakers to attend White House meeting on chip shortage","By Alexandra Alper, Stephen Nellis and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger plans to attend a virtual White House meeting on the global chip shortage on Thursday, along with representatives from companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), GM, Ford and Stellantis, people familiar with the matter said.
The meeting will be hosted by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, the Commerce Department said earlier this month. Topics will include the impact of the coronavirus Delta variant on chip supplies and how to better coordinate between chip producers and consumers. 
Other attendees will include TSMC, BMW and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), sources said.
The White House had said only that attendees would include producers, consumers and industry groups. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A shortage of semiconductor chips has forced top automakers to cut production worldwide after a decrease in demand for cars early in the coronavirus pandemic led many chipmakers to shift production to computers and tablets, whose demand was soaring.
The White House meeting is the latest in a string of summits on the topic, allowing the Biden administration to show it is taking the chip crunch seriously.

President Joe Biden met with executives from major companies in April, saying he had bipartisan support for legislation to fund the semiconductor industry. In May, Raimondo said she held meetings with three dozen senior industry leaders on the chip shortage and said the United States could help boost transparency in the market.
While Intel and TSMC have announced plans to ramp up chip production with new U.S.-based plants, it takes years for new semiconductor plants to ramp up to full production. Meanwhile, legislation to fund a plan to offer grants to chipmakers to expand or build new factories awaits congressional approval.

LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc on Thursday struck a deal with the firm behind Imperial College London's experimental COVID-19 vaccine to develop and sell drugs based on its self-amplifying RNA technology platform in other disease areas.
Under the deal, VaxEquity, a startup founded by Imperial vaccinologist Robin Shattock, could receive up to $195 million if certain milestones are met, in addition to royalties on approved drugs and equity investment from AstraZeneca and life sciences investor Morningside Ventures.
AstraZeneca already produces an adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine, and emphasised the potential of the self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology in novel therapeutic programmes beyond the coronavirus pandemic.
""This collaboration with VaxEquity adds a promising new platform to our drug discovery toolbox,"" said AstraZeneca research chief Mene Pangalos.
The technology works in a similar way to the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
However, a self-amplifying RNA vaccine not only encodes the instructions for the host cell to make a coronavirus protein, but makes lots of copies of the RNA containing those instructions, meaning doses can be smaller and cheaper.
""It's a bit like having a manufacturing facility, and instead of having one copy of the recipe, you have multiple copies that you can hand round to multiple production lines within the cell to produce more protein,"" Imperial's Shattock told Reuters. ""So that's why it has that opportunity to use lower doses.""
Imperial's COVID-19 vaccine is being retooled to produce a more consistent immune response with an eye on future coronavirus variants.
AstraZeneca, under the deal, has the option to collaborate on 26 drug targets for use against other therapeutic areas like cancers and rare genetic diseases.
""We believe self-amplifying RNA, once optimised, will allow us to target novel pathways not amenable to traditional drug discovery across our therapy areas of interest,"" Pangalos said.
U.S. companies Gritstone bio and Arcturus also are developing saRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 

Shattock said safety data had been encouraging from initial trials of its COVID-19 vaccine, released in July ahead of peer review, and that Phase I results of its refined vaccine would be ready early next year.
""The reason we were slower was because we were coming from an academic setting,"" he said. ""If we had this relationship (with AstraZeneca) at the beginning of 2020, we might have been faster.""

(Reuters) - Fonterra Co-operative Group is considering an initial public offer of its Australian operation, the world’s biggest dairy exporter said on Thursday, in an exercise that could return about $700 million to shareholders by 2024.
The first public revelation of the plans to list comes after the New Zealand dairy giant scaled back its global ambitions with a strategy to phase out overseas ""milk pools"", cut debt and focus on local production.
""It's a self-contained business, so there is a possibility of partnering effectively by taking some capital off the table and bringing some external investors,"" Chief Financial Officer Marc Rivers told Reuters in an interview. 
""That's why we announced our intention to explore that partial sale,"" he said, adding that Fonterra would retain a significant stake as Australia was a destination for a lot of New Zealand milk.
The process has just begun, with Fonterra exploring the level of interest for an IPO, Rivers said.
The company owned by its 10,000 New Zealand farmer shareholders said it was also reviewing the ownership of its milk pool in Chile.
About NZ$1 billion ($700 million) of the divestment proceeds from the Australia and Chile businesses will be returned to shareholders by 2024, Rivers said.
""If our strategy is focused on New Zealand milk, then we don't need capital tied up for that,"" he added. ""We can harvest that, release it and bring that in."" 
Fonterra reported after-tax net profit of NZ$599 million ($419.36 million) for the year ended July 31 on Thursday, down NZ$60 million from a year earlier.
It also proposed a new capital structure for new farmers to enter the co-operative more easily, as part of the strategy to claw back domestic market share.
Fonterra’s share of the domestic market for milk processing dropped to 82% by 2019 from 96% in 2001, with consultants TDB Advisory saying at the time it was expected to reach about 75% in 2021.

The new structure will also limit non-farmer investment in the listed Fonterra Shareholders Fund to protect farmer ownership and control.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday, following Wall Street upwards after the Federal Reserve delayed tapering to later in the year while concerns over heavily indebted Chinese property group Evergrande eased.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.8% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%.
The major European indices are expected to follow Wednesday’s positive lead from Wall Street, as all the major U.S. equity averages all closed firmly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for example, climbed well over 300 points, or 1%. 
These gains followed the U.S. central bank indicating at the conclusion of its latest policy-setting meeting that it will likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases towards the end of this year. That was a positive surprise for the minority who had expected an immediate start to the withdrawal of the stimulus that has been supporting the economy during the pandemic.
That said, the Fed turned more hawkish in terms of interest rates, with nine of 18 Fed officials - up from seven at the June meeting - ready to raise interest rates next year in response to higher levels of inflation. Inflation has run ahead of expectations this year, but the Fed still expects it to revert to more normal levels later.
Also helping the tone were solid gains in Chinese markets Thursday,  after the People’s Bank of China injected more money into the banking system, easing concerns about the fallout from China Evergrande's debt crisis. The stricken real estate developer said Wednesday it had reached an agreement to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, but it remains unclear whether the company will be able to pay $83.5 million in  interest on its dollar bonds which is due later Thursday.
Back in Europe, the Bank of England announces its latest monetary policy decision later in the session, but the central bank is not expected to change its record-low interest rates or the extent of its asset purchases. The central banks of Norway and Turkey may, however, raise their interest rates. 
The European data slate centers around the release of the flash Eurozone composite PMI data for an indication of the region’s economic well being. 
In corporate news,  Enel  (MI:ENEI), Europe’s largest utility, is planning on setting up a new company, called Gridspertise, dedicated to digital grid services, according to newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.
Crude prices edged higher Thursday, helped by another decline in U.S. oil stocks as production in the important Gulf of Mexico region remained hampered by the damage caused by two recent hurricanes.
Data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday showed crude inventories fell by almost 3.5 million barrels last week, the seven straight weekly decrease, and followed on from the 6.4-million-barrel draw recorded the previous week.
Crude oil supply data from the industry body, the American Petroleum Institute, released a day before, showed a draw of just over 6 million barrels.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $72.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $76.37. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,763.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1711.

Chinese airlines will need 8,700 new airplanes through 2040, 1.2% higher than its previous prediction of 8,600 planes made last year. Those would be worth $1.47 trillion based on list prices, the U.S. planemaker said in a statement.
The 1.2% increase contrasted with the 6.3% growth Boeing (NYSE:BA) forecast last year, which made China a bright spot in the aviation market at the height of coronavirus lockdowns worldwide.
Earlier this month, Boeing revised up long-term forecasts for global airplane demand on the back of a strong recovery in commercial air travel in domestic markets like the United States.
""There are promising opportunities to significantly expand international long-haul routes and air freight capacity,"" said Richard Wynne, managing director of China marketing at Boeing's commercial arm. 
""Longer-term, there is the potential for low-cost carrier growth to further build on single-aisle demand.""
China's domestic aviation market, although still vulnerable to sporadic local COVID-19 outbreaks, has more or less rebounded to pre-COVID levels, but the country's borders remain virtually closed, with the number of international flights only 2% of pre-COVID levels. 
Boeing projected a need for nearly 6,500 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years, while China's widebody fleet, including passenger and cargo models, will require 1,850 new planes, accounting for 20% of total deliveries.
Air freight market has become a bright spot for Boeing in China as e-commerce demand booms, even as the U.S. planemaker struggles with sales of passenger jets due to trade tensions and the grounding of its 737 MAX.

China's aviation authority, the first regulator to ground 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, has yet to approve the return of service for the aircraft in the country. China accounts for a quarter of Boeing's orders of all aircraft. 
China will also need nearly $1.8 trillion worth of commercial services for its aircraft fleet over the 20-year period, company said.

The new provisions require all companies using warehouse labour to disclose productivity quotas to employees and government agencies and bar use of algorithms that prevent employees from taking rests and bathroom breaks, thereby endangering their health and safety, the governor's office said.
The California State Senate this month approved the bill in a 26-11 vote.
""We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people,"" Newsom said in a statement, signing the measure into law. 
""The legislation ensures workers cannot be fired or retaliated against for failing to meet an unsafe quota.""
While Newsom's office did not single out any company in the statement, the New York Times reported that the bill was written partly in response to high rates of injuries at Amazon warehouses. 
The rate at which Amazon workers suffer serious injuries was nearly double that of the rest of the warehousing industry last year, the newspaper reported, citing studies.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety,"" Newsom said.
The California Retailers Association expressed disappointment that Newsom signed the bill, saying it ""will exacerbate our current supply chain issues, increase the cost of living for all Californians and eliminate good-paying jobs"".

SINGAPORE/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond on Wednesday, while the Chinese central bank injected cash into the banking system, temporarily soothing fears of imminent contagion from the debt-laden property developer.
Evergrande, Asia's biggest junk-bond issuer, is so entangled with China's broader economy that its fate has kept global stock and bond markets on tenterhooks as late debt payments could trigger so-called cross-defaults.
Many financial institutions have exposure to Evergrande through direct loans and indirect holdings, while any defaults will also trigger sell-offs in the high-yield credit market.
In an effort to reassure investors, the People's Bank of China's injected 90 billion yuan to the banking system, signalling support for markets as they braced for what is expected to be one of China's largest-ever debt restructurings.
Evergrande is scrambling to avoid defaulting on a number of bonds with payments due this week and its main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, said on Wednesday it had ""resolved"" one coupon payment due on Thursday on its Shenzhen-traded 5.8% September 2025 bond, via ""private negotiations"".
It did not specify how much interest would be paid or when, nor did Hengda mention Evergrande's other pressing debts, leaving it unclear what this means for $83.5 million in dollar bond interest payments due on Thursday.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to questions about its deal or its intentions.
But engagement with bondholders, a common way to avoid default, on top of chairman Hui Ka Yuan's vow this week that Evergrande would ""walk out of its darkest moment,"" cheered investors and soothed markets more broadly.
""These events seem to suggest that the company is taking control of the situation and is trying its best to work out a solution with creditors,"" Singapore-based Dexter Tan, a senior fixed income analyst at Bondsupermart.com, said.
Evergrande, which epitomised the borrow-to-build business model and was once China's top-selling developer, also has a $47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment due next week.
""We do not have a clearer picture as how Evergrande settled its onshore coupon,"" Singapore-based Chuanyi Zhou, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics, said. 
""It doesn't look like a cash payment. It may still miss the coupon on offshore bonds due tomorrow.""
Evergrande's woes have seen its shares fall 85% this year. The concerns have reverberated throughout China’s property market. 
Shares of R&F Properties and Sunac China have both slumped around 50% year-to-date, Shimao is down more than 40% and Country Garden and Greenland Holdings have shed 30% and 20%, respectively.
Evergrande's Hong Kong shares did not trade due to a public holiday but rose 40% in Frankfurt to 0.38 euros ($0.45).
Its dollar bonds maturing next year and in 2024 remained below 30 cents on the dollar.
In the wider market, the U.S. dollar slipped while the S&P 500 rebounded from recent losses. (N)
BREAKDOWN 
Analysts have been downplaying the risk that a collapse threatens a ""Lehman moment"", or liquidity crunch, which freezes the financial system and spreads globally.
Only some $20 billion of $305 billion outstanding debts is owed offshore, according to Refinitiv data.
But the risk of failure remains high, particularly if offshore bondholders are less willing than those in China to cut deals, and the fallout has already begun to trigger tremors in the property market of the world's second-largest economy.
“There are now comparisons being made between Evergrande with the collapse (of) Lehman Brothers and the crash in the U.S. housing market, with many analysts dismissing this comparison,” wrote Sebastien Galy of Nordea Asset Management in a recent note. “The reality is that it will take weeks to figure out the impact on growth given the impact on the real estate market.”
There is also mounting political pressure to act as the anger of retail investors with their savings sunk in Evergrande properties or wealth management products swells.
Asked at a regular daily briefing on Wednesday whether China would take measures to intervene, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian only referred to the ""responsible departments"".
Some funds have been increasing their positions in recent months. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and investment banks HSBC and UBS have been among the largest buyers of Evergrande's debt, Morningstar https://www.morningstar.hk/hk/news/215418/whos-buying-evergrandes-bonds.aspx?lang=en-hk data and a blog post showed.
Other bondholders include UBS Asset Management and Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager. 
Still, many market participants believe the fallout from Evergrande is likely to be contained.

""Despite the worry, so far this looks like a corporate bankruptcy and not something worse,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in a recent note. ""It’s a big one, to be sure, but one that can be handled within the system.""

Global markets were closely watching whether Evergrande will be able to pay interest on one of its dollar bonds due on Thursday, after some relief the previous day when the People's Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan ($13.9 billion) into the banking system and an Evergrande unit said it had ""resolved"" a coupon payment on an onshore bond.
At a meeting held at 11:00 pm (1500 GMT), Evergrande chairman stressed to staff the importance to resume constructions and to have a ""highly responsible attitude"" towards helping wealth investors redeem their products, adding it was the company's top priority.

The chairman has repeated those messages in several occasions this month, as it has an estimated 40 billion yuan ($6 billion) of wealth management products outstanding and hundreds of thousands of uncompleted homes to deliver to homebuyers.
The company said on Saturday it has begun repaying investors in its wealth management products with real estate, and investors interested in redeeming the products for physical assets should contact their investment consultants or visit local offices.

""I'd be naive to think that the turmoil in the market doesn't have the potential to have second-order and third-order impact,"" Noel Quinn said at a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) conference on Wednesday, according to a webcast on HSBC's website.
Evergrande's situation was ""concerning and there is a potential for second and third-order impact, particularly on the capital markets and the bond markets. And we've got to stay close to that,"" he said.
HSBC's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 1.8% in early trade on Thursday, in line with gains in the broader market. HSBC's shares recovered from a 10-month low struck on Tuesday. Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday on Wednesday.
Evergrande faced a Thursday deadline to pay interest on one of its dollar bonds, in a crucial moment for global investors worried that its malaise could spread beyond the country's property sector.
Quinn said HSBC was very focused on its commercial real estate business in China and Hong Kong.
""We focus typically on Tier 1 cities, Tier 1 properties, Tier 1 lenders. We have a well-managed exposure there. We're not unduly concerned by that exposure,"" he said.

Quinn said HSBC's loan loss provisions in Hong Kong and China as outlined in its half-year results https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-hldg-results-idTRNIKBN2F30A2 indicated that the lender was not concerned about its commercial real estate exposure in China.
""Nothing has happened in the recent weeks that will change that position in my mind for us as a bank, as an institution,"" Quinn said.

""The directors are cautious and concerned about the recent development of China Evergrande Group including certain disclosure made by China Evergrande Group on its liquidity,"" Chinese Estates said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
With $305 billion in liabilities, Evergrande is struggling to meet its debt obligations and investors worry that the rot could spread to creditors including banks in China and abroad.
Shares of Chinese Estates jumped as much as 15.1% in early trading to HK$2.51, notching the biggest daily percentage gain since June 2020.
China Evergrande stock soared as much as 32% in the biggest daily percentage rise since listing in November 2009, after its unit said on Wednesday it had ""resolved"" a coupon payment on an onshore bond.
Chinese Estates, which owned about 6.50% of Evergrande's equity capital as of Sept. 10 according to Refinitiv Eikon data, said it has mandated a sale of all or part of the remaining 5.66% Evergrande stake either on the market or through block trades.
The disposal mandate will be valid for 12 months from the date of a shareholders' meeting on Sept. 23 to approve the sale, it said. 
Chinese Estates said it had already sold 108.91 million shares, or 0.82%, of Evergrande's issued share capital between Aug. 30 and Sept. 21 for HK$246.5 million ($32 million).
The company estimated that if the entire stake is sold, it will realise a loss of about HK$9,486.3 million ($1.22 billion) for the year ending in December 2021.

Proceeds from the disposals will be used for general working capital and for reinvestment when opportunities arise, it added.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, with investors digesting the prospect that the U.S. Federal Reserve could begin asset tapering as soon as November 2021.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.05% while the Shenzhen Component was steady at 14,277.08 by 9:44 PM ET (1:44 AM GMT). China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt crisis continues to be on investors’ radars, even as some concerns were eased after it issued a vaguely worded statement on a local bond interest payment. However, questions remain about the developer’s $300 billion of liabilities and the payment due on a dollar note.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.10%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.56% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.07%.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, but the Bank of Japan kept its interest rate steady at -0.10% on Wednesday.
Shorter-maturity U.S. Treasury notes fell while longer-maturity debt trended upwards. Cash Treasuries trading will not take place on Thursday due to the holiday in Japan.
The Fed could begin scaling back asset purchases in November 2021 and complete the process by mid-2022, Chairman Jerome Powell said as the central bank handed down its latest policy decision on Wednesday. The Fed is likely to also begin hiking interest rates after completing the tapering process, he added.
Fears about China Evergrande, alongside the Fed’s shift away from its dovish stance, have led to market volatility about a slowing economic recovery from COVID-19. However, some investors remained optimistic.
“The Fed has got to be pleased that their communication on the longer way to asset tapering has avoided the dreaded fear of the tantrum,” BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). senior portfolio manager for systematic fixed income Jeffrey Rosenberg told Bloomberg.
“The flatter curve is kind of an initial response. Yes, the curve is flatter, but you’ve got to squint to see that market reaction. This is a very good outcome for the Fed in terms of signaling their intent to give the market information well ahead of the asset tapering decision.”
Powell, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida will discuss the economic recovery from COVID-19 on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England hands down its policy decision later in the day."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc Chief Executive Kewsong Lee said on Wednesday that the U.S. private equity firm will remain a long-term investor in China despite ""bumps"" that have unnerved some investors.
Beijing authorities have rolled out restrictions in the last few weeks on companies, including those in the technology sector, to control big data and break down monopolistic practices. They announced an investigation into Didi Global Inc and ordered the removal of its apps for download in China days after the ride-sharing giant's initial public offering in New York. 
The crackdown has sparked investor concerns over policy changes and wiped off hundreds of billions of dollars in market value from some of China's largest companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Limited and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. Investor concerns this week that property developer China Evergrande could default on its massive debt pile have added to the market jitters.
""We at Carlyle are very strategically committed to that region and we have seen these types of bumps in the middle of the night in that part of the world,"" Lee said in an interview at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York when asked about the impact of China's restrictions on companies.
Lee said that sophisticated investors such as sovereign wealth funds and pension plans remain underinvested in China, the world's second-largest economy, and that there were still opportunities available to investment firms with local expertise such as Carlyle that can navigate the country's complex regulatory environment. 
Carlyle, which had $276 billion in assets under management as of the end of June, continues to be focused on the rise of consumers in China, its under-penetrated healthcare sector, and Chinese technology firms, Lee said.
On the drive toward sustainability and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), Lee said that in the first half of this year nearly 60% of the board directors who joined companies that have been controlled by Carlyle for at least two years were from diverse backgrounds, putting it ahead of its 30% target. 
He also said that even companies whose business contributes to climate change can be good ESG investments if their track record improves sufficiently. 

""I think people have to also understand that you have to invest in traditional companies to provide capital to enable them to transition,"" he said.
Lee has been rolling out changes to improve Carlyle's fee-related earnings and boost its share price, which has doubled in the last 12 months. He said the firm's strategic plan was paying off, with the pace of fundraising and investing rapidly accelerating and performance fees hitting a record.

(Reuters) -Toast Inc fetched a valuation of nearly $33 billion in its New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday, as shares of the restaurant software provider jumped 63%, underscoring a deep investor appetite for fast-growing software firms.
The stock opened at $65.26, compared with its initial public offering price of $40 per share. The valuation marked a substantial jump from the company's last private funding round when it was valued at $4.9 billion in February 2020. 
Toast's listing comes at a time when digital transformation among restaurants has accelerated during the pandemic, and merchants have adopted Toast software to manage takeout system through first-party delivery or working with partners, including DoorDash Inc and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats.
""We're in our early days, and we believe that we could be the unified platform that powers the restaurant industry,"" said Chris Comparato, chief executive at Toast.
The Boston-based company builds software that helps restaurants manage online orders and dine-in order, operate an on-demand delivery network and integrate payments.
Founded in 2011, Toast counts TPG, Tiger Global Management and Bessemer Venture Partners among its backers. It partnered with nearly 48,000 restaurant locations and processed more than $38 billion in gross payment volumes over the 12 months ended June 30. 
As restaurant revenues plunged due to lockdowns and other restrictions, Toast cut its workforce and launched new features to cater to the shifts in dining behavior, including contactless ordering, indoor dining payments through QR codes, curbside notifications for takeout and deliveries on a flat-fee basis.
Toast's net loss widened to $235 million for the six months ended June 30, from $125 million a year earlier. Revenue, however, more than doubled to $704 million.

The company sold 21.7 million shares in its IPO, raising about $869.6 million. Its IPO was priced above an earlier targeted price range of $34 to $36 per share.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead underwriters for Toast's IPO.

U.S.-listed shares of the company, which rose 9.1% to $10.43 in extended trading, had already risen 8% ahead of the results.
Firms such as BlackBerry are benefiting from an uptick in demand for cybersecurity and IoT products as more businesses and government organizations shift their operations to the cloud in order to support hybrid working. 
As a result, the company was able to offset weakness from sluggish demand for its QNX software from automakers like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Ford Motor (NYSE:F), as the auto industry struggled to maintain production amid a persistent chip shortage crisis.
BlackBerry was dubbed a ""meme stock"" after a social media driven retail trading frenzy that began earlier this year sent its shares soaring. BlackBerry's stock has surged 40% so far this year.
However, the company warned that a drop in automobile production volumes due to COVID-19 closures and chip shortages will continue to adversely affect the company in the next two quarters this fiscal year.
BlackBerry also appointed John Giamatteo, formerly of cybersecurity firm McAfee, as the President of its cybersecurity business.
Revenue fell to $175 million for the quarter ended Aug. 31, from $259 million a year earlier, but beat analysts' expectation of $163.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss widened to $144 million, or 25 cents per share, from $23 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said a non-cash accounting adjustment to the fair value of convertible debentures, due to market and trading conditions, accounted for approximately $0.12 loss per share.
Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 6 cents per share, nudging past analysts' expectations of loss of 7 cents.

The California-based company said the ground minced pork substitute would be available in 120 restaurants in Hong Kong from Oct 4. 
The product will also be sold in some Hong Kong grocery stores as ready to eat meals. The company is also debuting the product in New York's Manhattan restaurant Momofuku Ssam Bar from Sept. 23.
Reuters reported in April that Impossible, which makes faux beef products, is preparing for a public listing which could value the U.S. company at around $10 billion or more. Impossible is exploring going public through an initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12 months or a merger with a so-called special acquisition company (SPAC).
“It’s a natural step in evolution and growth of our business but the timing is really (to be decided) and we will see how it goes over the course of the next year,” Dennis Woodside (OTC:WOPEY), president of Impossible Foods, told Reuters in an interview.
Impossible’s pork product, which is made from the same key ingredient as its beef product– soy -enters the Hong Kong market at a time when homegrown brands, including Green Monday’s Omnipork have already made inroads into the pork substitutes market in Asia’s financial hub.

Impossible’s product will be priced higher than animal pork to start with but the company said it aims to continually drive down prices as it has done for its Impossible Beef products.
“We are optimizing our manufacturing process, really every month, and continually growing our manufacturing footprint and as we fill up our factories that is when we can lower unit cost,” Woodside said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is pressing President Joe Biden's administration and a U.S. appeals court to move quickly to hike civil penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel economy requirements.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla sells credits to other automakers to help them meet government vehicle emissions requirements, and says those credits are less valuable due to changes in rules made by former President Donald Trump's administration. Tesla met virtually on Aug. 30 with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), according to a document filed by the agency last week.
On Aug. 18, the NHTSA issued a notice saying it could impose higher penalties for prior model years for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements but will first consider public comments.
Automakers have warned that hiking penalties could cost them at least $1 billion annually, both for failing to meet the rules and higher prices for credits used to meet the rules.
The Trump administration in its final days in January delayed a 2016 regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements.
The government memo said Tesla suggested NHTSA withdraw Trump's action immediately, saying it ""produces continuing uncertainty in investments and transactions across the industry, and any delays will continue to have deleterious effects on the credit market until the issue is resolved."" It added Tesla believes ""any delays will continue to have deleterious effects on the credit market.""
Tesla on Aug. 27 separately again asked the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to quickly reinstate higher penalties. The court rejected Tesla's request in April for immediate action pending NHTSA's review.
""The uncertainty perpetuated by NHTSA’s sluggish rulemaking pace is thus compounded by the likelihood of yet another round of litigation,"" Tesla wrote, warning uncertainty ""may linger for several more years.""
A group representing major automakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), asked the court to reject Tesla's request. ""That Tesla might benefit from more certainty about the worth of the CAFE credits that it has amassed is hardly a reason to cut off an ongoing administrative process,"" the group wrote in a court filing.
Under former President Barack Obama, higher penalties were to start in 2019 model year, but Trump set the effective date as the 2022 model year. NHTSA is considering reinstating the Obama rule.

Those prior year CAFE penalties, which have still not been assessed, could cost Chrysler parent Stellantis hundreds of millions of dollars, while boosting the value of credits sold by Tesla.
Stellantis said in August costs related to potential higher CAFE penalties could be about 521 million euros ($609 million). Fiat Chrysler paid nearly $150 million for failing to meet 2016 and 2017 requirements.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) blocked an attempt by Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA to make debt payments to a Siemens unit, a Citi executive testified on Wednesday in a U.S. trial over whether PDVSA is liable for the payments. 
In a bench trial that began on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, PDVSA is contending that U.S. sanctions implemented in August 2017 rendered payment impossible.
The dispute stems from a January 2017 promissory note that cash-strapped PDVSA issued to oilfield equipment provider Dresser-Rand for $120 million, plus interest. PDVSA made the first two interest payments for about $4 million, but defaulted on a $1.9 million payment due in October 2017. 
In May 2020, U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a $149.5 million judgment in Dresser-Rand's favor. 
On Tuesday, Raymond Romano, Citi's chief administration officer for Latin America, testified that Citi blocked PDVSA's wire attempt because ""it did not meet our requirements for processing."" 
The case shows how the sanctions - intended to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to restore democracy - have had far-reaching consequences for Western companies that do business with PDVSA. 
Maduro calls the sanctions ""criminal"" and blames them for the country's economic crisis.
In a Sept. 25, 2017 email submitted as evidence, a Citi employee told Dresser-Rand that the bank restricted Venezuela and PDVSA activities because of the sanctions, but that it would consider processing pre-approved transactions. 
Romano said Dresser-Rand did not seek pre-approval. 

In testimony that could bolster Dresser-Rand's argument that PDVSA had other ways to make the payment, he said that Citi implemented the PDVSA-related restrictions before the August 2017 sanctions based on its own internal risk policies. 
Stephanie Rice, a former sanctions compliance officer at various banks who was called by Dresser-Rand as an expert witness, said the payment was not in violation of sanctions and other banks may have processed it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major U.S. stock indexes rose 1% on Wednesday as investors mostly took in stride the latest signals from the Federal Reserve, including clearing the way for the central bank to reduce its monthly bond purchases soon.
The S&P 500 registered its biggest daily percentage gain since July 23.
While trading was choppy following the Fed's latest policy statement and comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, stocks finished close to where they were before the central bank news.
In its statement, the central bank also suggested interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected and said overall indicators in the economy ""have continued to strengthen.""
Stocks began the day higher as concerns eased over a default by China's Evergrande. Evergrande's main unit said it had negotiated a deal with bondholders to settle interest payments on a domestic bond.
Bank shares rose following the Fed news, with the S&P banks index ending up 2.1% on the day, and S&P 500 financials up 1.6% and among the biggest gainers among sectors.
Some strategists viewed the Fed's comments as mixed.
""So they said we're going to probably start to taper, but they haven't said when and haven't said how much, so we're kind of back where we were a day ago,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
""Those remain open questions,"" he said. ""Also, financial conditions remain very easy, and that's part of the reason why markets aren't going crazy at this point.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 338.48 points, or 1%, to 34,258.32, the S&P 500 gained 41.45 points, or 0.95%, to 4,395.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 150.45 points, or 1.02%, to 14,896.85.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other big technology-related names gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost.
On the downside, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) tumbled 9.1% after posting a lower quarterly profit and as the delivery firm cut its full-year earnings forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 52 new highs and 66 new lows.

Schroepfer said in a Facebook post that veteran leader Andrew Bosworth, who heads up the social media company's augmented reality and virtual reality efforts, including products like its Oculus Quest VR headset, will take over the role in 2022.
Schroepfer, who is known as ""Schrep"" and spent 13 years at Facebook, said he would transition to a part-time role as the company's first Senior Fellow sometime next year.
Bosworth, or ""Boz,"" created Facebook's AR/VR organization, which was renamed Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) in 2020.
""As our next CTO, Boz will continue leading Facebook Reality Labs and overseeing our work in augmented reality, virtual reality and more, and as part of this transition a few other groups will join Boz’s team as well,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a message to employees that was posted on Facebook's blog.
""This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I'm excited about the future of this work under Boz’s leadership,"" he said, referring to the Silicon Valley idea of shared spaces that merge the digital and physical worlds and can be accessed through different devices.
Facebook is under pressure from global regulators, lawmakers and civil society groups who have criticized it over abuses on its platform such as extremism and misinformation and want it to improve on a slew of issues including transparency, its content moderation and recommendation systems, and its approaches to user privacy and safety.
The company has been pushing its role in building an embodied internet, or ""metaverse,"" which Zuckerberg is betting will be the next big computing platform. 
In July, the company said it was creating a new product team to work on these ambitions, as part of Facebook Reality Labs.

Zuckerberg said Schroepfer's new role would include helping the company recruit and develop technical talent and foster investments in artificial intelligence.
Other central leaders who have left the company in recent months include the head of Facebook's main app, Fidji Simo, who left to become Instacart CEO, and global ads chief Carolyn Everson, who was hired as the start-up's president.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. labor complaint under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact over a General Motors (NYSE:GM) plant union vote in Mexico has been successfully concluded, lifting the threat of U.S. tariffs on the factory's pickup trucks, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said on Wednesday.
The United States opened the case in May after complaints that workers' rights at a GM pickup-truck plant in Silao in central Mexico were being violated in a vote on whether to keep or scrap their collective union contract. 
The result was suspended after Mexico's labor ministry found irregularities in the process and workers voted in a repeat ballot in August to scrap the contract, opening the door for them to oust one of Mexico's largest labor groups as their union.
The vote, with safeguards agreed upon by Mexico and the United States to ensure a fair vote, was the first test of labor rules under the USMCA accord that replaced the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
""We will continue to collaborate closely with Mexico to strengthen the legitimization vote process and ensure workers in Mexico can access their rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining,"" said U.S. Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai in a statement. 
The vote in August marked a defeat for one of the most powerful unions in Mexico, while representing an opening for workers to freely choose independent groups they feel will best fight for their interests.
Labor remedies under USMCA include revoking tariff-free access for the violating factory's goods. In GM's case, that could have meant applying a 25% U.S. pickup truck import tariff on Silao-made trucks, likely adding thousands of dollars to each vehicle's cost.
Tai helped negotiate the labor enforcement mechanism on behalf of Democrats in the U.S. Congress.

GM won key changes to USMCA that allowed it to continue to build hundreds of thousands of high-profit pickups in Mexico for export to the United States annually.
GM did not immediately comment Wednesday.

Some of the most liberal House Democrats had objected to the provision and said they would vote against the broad spending bill. This threatened its passage because Republicans were lined up against the plan to fund the federal government through Dec. 3 and raise the nation's borrowing limit.
The removal led Republicans to label Democrats as anti-Israel, despite a long tradition in the U.S. Congress of strong support from both parties for the Jewish state, to which Washington sends billions of dollars in aid every year.
The United States has already provided more than $1.6 billion for Israel to develop and build the Iron Dome system, according to a Congressional Research Service report last year.
Some liberal Democrats have voiced concerns this year about U.S.-Israel policy, citing among other things the many Palestinian casualties as Israel responded to Hamas rocket attacks in May. Israel said most of the 4,350 rockets fired from Gaza during the conflict were blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.

The bill introduced on Wednesday by Representative Rosa DeLauro provides $1 billion to replace missile interceptors used during that conflict.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer had said on Tuesday evening he would bring the Iron Dome bill to the House floor later this week.

Chief Technical Officer Sabine Klauke said the planemaker would build a flying demonstrator to test elements including ""gust sensors,"" with conclusions expected by mid-decade.
The project - first reported by industry publication The Air Current - complements the same planemaker's UK-based ""Wing of Tomorrow"" eco-wing programme, which is preparing the ground for future competition with U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Airbus said the first full-size prototype in that project, designed to be tested on the ground, had been assembled.
The six-year-old UK wing project is designed to pioneer a production system capable of handling next-generation wings for future aircraft programmes like a mooted 2030s replacement of the best-selling A320/321 or an upgrade to the existing model.
An Airbus official told Bloomberg News in May that the aim was a wing that would be both affordable and capable of being built at a high production rate.
The new ""extra performance"" project will focus on the actual design and aerodynamic performance of such a wing, officials said at a company environmental conference, the Airbus Summit.
Wing design is one of the main areas of competition between Airbus and Boeing, which brought previously outsourced wing expertise in-house with a composite wing centre for its 777X.
Wings tend to improve in aerodynamic performance when their wingspan is longer, but a longer structure typically adds weight and finding the right balance is a complex juggling act.

The proposed new wing would include ""pop-up spoilers"" or wing surfaces to alter its profile and get the best performance, just as a bird twists its feathers, Airbus officials said.
The announcement came at the end of a two-day conference designed to showcase industry pledges to cut emissions amid climate concerns from politicians and investors.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets ended solidly higher and the U.S. dollar strengthened on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for the central bank to reduce its monthly bond purchases soon, while easing market jitters around property developer China Evergrande helped risk appetite.
Wall Street's main indexes ended up about 1%, although asset price moves were volatile in the wake of the Fed's latest policy statement, in which the central bank also signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
“The policy of the Fed, which is I think favorable for U.S. equities, remains reasonably unchanged,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.
""When you look at how low rates have remained, and the fact that even if the Fed begins to moderately taper, it’s going to be a long process to return to historic real rates.”
U.S. equity indexes ended at about the same level they were at before the Fed announcement. Stocks had been stronger earlier in the session after Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, while the Chinese central bank injected cash into the banking system. The developments soothed fears of imminent contagion from the debt-laden property developer that had pressured equities and other riskier assets at the start of the week.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.73%, bouncing back for a second day after it logged its biggest one-day percentage drop in two months on Monday.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 338.48 points, or 1%, to 34,258.32, the S&P 500 gained 41.45 points, or 0.95%, to 4,395.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 150.45 points, or 1.02%, to 14,896.85.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.99%.
In a week filled with central bank meetings, investors have been focused on the Fed to see when the central bank will start pulling back on its monetary stimulus put in place during the pandemic.
In currency trading, the dollar index rose 0.238%, with the euro down 0.27% to $1.1691. The Japanese yen weakened 0.50% versus the greenback at 109.78 per dollar.
""Very mixed signals from the Fed, resulting in the dollar's choppy performance,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Business Solutions in Washington. ""Once the dust settles it seems that there are enough hawkish signals to keep the dollar biased higher, as the market pencils in a sooner-than-expected rate hike.""
Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 1.3057%, from 1.324% late on Tuesday.

(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the Fed is closely monitoring efforts by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co to fix its ""widespread and pervasive"" problems, and that it would take appropriate actions if the bank failed to do so. 
In 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following sales practice scandals. That constrains Wells Fargo's ability to make new loans. 
Powell said on Wednesday that the bank's asset cap would stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems, suggesting the bank had a ways to go before it would be allowed to expand in size.
""We're not going to remove that asset cap until that's done,"" he said. 
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the bank $250 million for failing to properly pay back wronged customers as directed in a 2018 consent order.

The OCC also placed new restrictions on the bank's ability to expand its mortgage servicing business until it had addressed those shortcomings. At the time, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said the bank was still working on addressing ""significant, longstanding deficiencies.""
On Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was closely monitoring the bank's efforts to address its numerous issues, and would not hesitate to impose fresh penalties if it fails to meet its expectations.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - China's Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp said on Wednesday that its devices do not censor users' communications, a day after Lithuania's Defence Ministry recommended that consumers avoid Chinese phones due to a censoring feature in the smartphone giant's flagship phone.
The censoring capability in Xiaomi's Mi 10T 5G phone software has been turned off for the ""European Union region"" but can be turned on remotely at any time, the National Cyber Security Centre said in a report on Tuesday.
In a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday, Xiaomi spokesman said its device ""does not censor communications to or from its users"".
""Xiaomi has never and will never restrict or block any personal behaviours of our smartphone users, such as searching, calling, web browsing or the use of third-party communication software,"" the statement said.
""Xiaomi fully respects and protects the legal rights of all users,"" it added.
The National Cyber Centre's report also said the Xiaomi phone was sending encrypted phone usage data to a server in Singapore, which could be against European data regulations.
The Xiaomi spokesman said: ""Xiaomi complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.""
Deputy Defence Minister Margiris Abukevicius told Reuters the ministry shared its report with cyber security officials from other European Union nations and the United States on Wednesday.
According to the report, the terms potentially subject to censorship by the Xiaomi phone's system apps, such as the default internet browser, include ""Free Tibet"", ""Long live Taiwan independence"" and ""democracy movement"". 
China demanded last month that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador in Beijing and said it would recall its envoy to Vilnius after Taiwan announced that its mission in Lithuania would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office.

Taiwanese missions in Europe and the United States use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding a reference to the island itself, which China claims as its own territory.
U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan last week stressed support to Lithuania's prime minister Ingrida Simonyte in the face of pressure from China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Six former U.S. Treasury secretaries urged congressional leaders to raise the federal debt limit without delay, saying that a default would cause ""serious economic and national security harm"" and that delay would also be detrimental.
""Even a short-lived default could threaten economic growth. It creates the risk of roiling markets, and of sapping economic confidence, and it would prevent Americans from receiving vital services,"" the six former secretaries said in the letter https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Former-Treasury-Secretaries-Letter-to-Congressional-Leadership-on-the-Debt-Limit-9-22-21.pdf, released by Treasury. ""It would be very damaging to undermine trust in the full faith and credit of the United States, and this damage would be hard to repair.""
The letter was not signed by former Republican Treasury secretaries Steven Mnuchin, John Snow, Nicholas Brady or James Baker. Those signing were Democrats Jacob Lew, Timothy Geithner, Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin and Michael Blumenthal. Republican former secretary Henry Paulson also signed.
Mnuchin could not immediately be reached for comment. He presided over the last debt limit suspension, in August 2019, passed by both Democrats and Republicans.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that without a debt ceiling increase, the U.S. government will likely exhaust Treasury cash balances and extraordinary borrowing capacity under the $28.4 trillion debt limit in October, leaving the government at risk of default on Treasury debt and other obligations.
Republicans have refused to support a debt ceiling hike because of Democrats' plans to pass a massive social spending bill of up to $3.5 trillion without Republican support.
Senate Republicans are indicating they will sink a bill passed by House Democrats to suspend the debt ceiling and fund the government past the Sept. 30 fiscal year end, with a showdown vote likely next week.
The letter from the former Treasury secretaries left out references to Democrats' ""reconciliation"" spending bill, but acknowledges the contentious political divide in Washington and said the Biden administration had a role to play in lifting the debt limit. 
""We recognize that in recent years, as our politics have become more polarized and divisive, addressing the debt limit has become more contentious and politically fraught,"" they wrote. ""This makes it all the more important that Congress and the Administration begin the process to extend the nation’s borrowing authority without delay.""

The letter concentrated on economic consequences of failure to raise the debt limit and said the risk of an ""accidental default"" was heightened because pandemic rescue spending had made borrowing needs more uncertain.
""There is no viable way to manage payments across the federal government to prevent a default if there are insufficient resources available absent action on the debt limit,"" the former Treasury chiefs wrote, adding that postponing action until close to the default deadline ""undermines confidence in our political system at home and abroad.""

Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public through a merger at a later date.
The lawmakers sought information on how investments in SPACs were solicited, how these executives were compensated and if such compensation was tied to the stock performance of the merged entity created out of a deal between a SPAC and a private firm.
""We seek information about your use of SPACs in order to understand what sort of Congressional or regulatory action may be necessary to better protect investors,"" Senators Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Tina Smith and Chris Van Hollen wrote in the letters.
The letters were sent to six SPAC investors, including Cantor Fitzgerald's Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick, former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banker Michael Klein, casino mogul and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and veteran investor Chamath Palihapitiya.
The letters were also sent to David Hamamoto, who led the SPAC that merged with EV maker Lordstown Motors Corp, and former General Motors (NYSE:GM) Vice Chairman Stephen Girsky.

The blank-check market, which saw dealmaking activity at a frenetic pace since last year, has somewhat fizzled out after coming under the scanner of regulators in the United States earlier this year.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also reviewing such acquisition vehicles, seeking clearer disclosures.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rallied Wednesday, shrugging off the Federal Reserve's signal that tapering of its bond purchases could get underway as soon as November.      
The S&P 500 rose 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1%, or 338 points, the Nasdaq climbed 1%.
“If progress continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,” the Fed said in a statement.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell later signaled the taper could get underway in November, and end in mid-2022.  “Participants generally view, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate,” Powell said in a press conference that followed the monetary policy statement. 
Leading up to the meeting, however, many analysts were betting on a November taper, and suggested that the announcement was priced in.     
Cyclical sectors including energy climbed more than 3%, underpinned by rising oil prices following data showing weekly U.S. oil supplies fell by a more than expected last week.
Crude oil inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 2.4 million barrels.
Sentiment on oil has also been supported by “news that the OPEC countries of Nigeria and Angola, and OPEC+ member Kazakhstan, have lasting difficulties expanding their production due to a lack of investment,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
In a further boost to sentiment on cyclical stocks - those that move in tandem with the economy - China contagion fears subsided after Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond on Wednesday, and the central of China pumped further liquidity into the financial system.
In big tech, meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 4%, proved a drag on the sector after the social media giant warned that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ad-tracking would hurt growth.
In earnings news, Adobe and FedEx were among the major names in the spotlight. 
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported third-quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, but slowing growth in its core digital media business weighed the tech company’s shares.
“Adobe reported mixed F3Q results that exceeded consensus estimates on both top and bottom line offset by the core Digital Media ARR missing expectations,” Oppenheimer said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday named David Strickland, the former top U.S. auto-safety official who now serves as a senior Senate aide, as its regulatory affairs chief as the largest American automaker expands its electric vehicle plans.
Detroit-based GM said it is tapping Strickland as vice president for global regulatory affairs, beginning Oct. 1. 
Strickland is currently the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's staff director. He previously served as U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) chief under former President Barack Obama.
GM, moving aggressively to develop self-driving vehicles, has said it aspires to stop selling gasoline-powered new light-duty passenger vehicles by 2035. Strickland will also be working on self-driving vehicle issues.
The automaker's global public policy chief Omar Vargas said in a statement that Strickland will help ""drive regulatory policies in support of GM's growth initiatives, including our vision for an all-electric and autonomous future.""
The agency that Strickland formerly headed is investigating 13 reported fires involving GM's electric Chevrolet Bolt. GM in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules, at a cost now estimated at $1.8 billion, and has extended the shutdown of a Michigan assembly plant to mid-October.
GM said this week it plans to begin replacing these batteries next month.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell noted that Strickland has served on the panel for more than 11 years during various stints. 

""I'm happy that someone with David's integrity and experience will have a hand in advancing General Motors' transition to electric vehicles,"" Cantwell said.
Melissa Porter, the committee's deputy staff director, will assume Strickland's responsibilities. Porter was heavily involved in the efforts last year to enact reforms to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of airplane manufacturers following two fatal crashes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airliners.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman's 10% bet on Universal Music Group (AS:UMG) helped nearly double returns at his own portfolio to 15.3% this week after shares in the world's biggest music label surged in their first hours as a publicly traded company.
Ackman, who runs hedge fund firm Pershing Square Capital Management, told investors that his Pershing Square Holdings portfolio returned 15.3% after fees since January. The fund was up 7.7% a week ago.
The gains were largely fueled by his investment in Universal Music Group (UMG), the label that is home to Taylor Swift, Bob Dylan and the Beatles. Ackman pivoted a few weeks ago, buying the sizable stake in the record label through his portfolios after his initial plan to invest through a blank-check company deal crumbled in July amid scrutiny from U.S. regulators.
The billionaire investor told his investors that humans need food, water and music, and that music, which he called the cheapest form of entertainment in the world, is a very savvy investment because it pays royalties.
He raised $1.1 billion in fresh capital for the UMG stake through a co-investment vehicle, a structure he has previously used for investments in Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and Air Products (NYSE:APD) & Chemicals. In total, Ackman's funds invested $4 billion in UMG.
Ackman posted a 70.2% return in 2020 following a 58.1% return in 2019. This year the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, which measures returns for the industry, is up 3.58%. 

In the first eight months of the year Ackman's best performing stocks included Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A), and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ). He sold Agilent to help fund his commitment to UMG.
In its first day of trading in Amsterdam on Tuesday, UMG's shares leapt by more than a third, pushing its market value to $55 billion in Europe's largest listing of the year.

Fed chair Jerome Powell later signaled the taper could get underway in November, and end in mid-2022.  “Participants generally view, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate,” Powell said in a press conference that followed the monetary policy statement. 
Leading up to the meeting, however, many analysts were betting on a November taper, and suggested that the announcement was priced in.     
Cyclical sectors including energy climbed more than 3%, underpinned by rising oil prices following data showing weekly U.S. oil supplies fell by a more than expected last week.
Crude oil inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 2.4 million barrels.
Sentiment on oil has also been supported by “news that the OPEC countries of Nigeria and Angola, and OPEC+ member Kazakhstan, have lasting difficulties expanding their production due to a lack of investment,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
In a further boost to sentiment on cyclical stocks - those that move in tandem with the economy - China contagion fears subsided after Evergrande agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond on Wednesday, and the central of China pumped further liquidity into the financial system.
In big tech, meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 4%, proved a drag on the sector after the social media giant warned that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ad-tracking would hurt growth.
The broader market’s attempt at mounting a rebound comes just ahead of the Federal Reserve monetary policy decision, with the Fed’s plan on tapering its bond purchases likely to dominate investor attention.
“The FOMC will conclude its 2 day meeting this afternoon (9/22) with most expecting the Fed to begin to signal (or least give hints) to the start of tapering in November,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note."

As such, quality mid-cap stocks Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD), Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG), Dillard's (NYSE:DDS), and Atkore (ATKR) could deliver solid returns in the coming months. These stocks have an overall ‘Strong Buy’ rating and favorable value and growth grades in our proprietary rating system. Read on.The major U.S. stock market indexes declined significantly on September 20 on investors’ pessimism surrounding China’s Evergrande Group, which might be on the brink of default. The stock market’s volatility can also be attributed to uncertainty regarding the timing of the Federal Reserve’s tapering activities and the increase in COVID-19 cases.
However, according to the Labor Department, the consumer price index (CPI) in August increased 5.3% from a year earlier and 0.3% from July, less than expected, signaling that inflation may be starting to cool. Furthermore, surprisingly, retail sales rose 0.7% in August despite fears related to the resurgence of the COVID-19 cases.
Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality mid-cap stocks Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD),  Signet Jewelers Limited  (SIG), Dillard's, Inc. (DDS), and Atkore Inc. (ATKR).

Investing.com -- Stocks recovered on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept short-term rates untouched but said it would begin to reduce its monthly bond purchases soon, as the economy recovers from the pandemic.
Investors appeared to have shaken off concerns about a default by China property developer Evergrande, a fear that sent stocks plummeting during Monday’s session. The company said it has a deal with bondholders over interest payments.
Big technology companies helped lift the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite, while banks lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average heading into the last half-hour of trading.
September has ushered in a wave of investor uncertainty, not only over the course of the economic recovery but over policy decisions in Washington. Overnight, the House approved a measure that would fund the government to December and push the debt ceiling out to the end of next year. Still, the bill faces a tougher test in the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans are evenly divided.
But good data on retail sales and factory activity this month bolstered expectations that the Fed would start to taper its bond purchases sooner rather than later.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Dining out
Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), the owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, is expected to report first-quarter earnings per share of $1.64 on revenue of $2.24 billion.
2. Warehouse club earnings

-Enterprise software maker Freshworks Inc was valued at $12.2 billion in its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday after shares opened 21% above the initial offering price, indicating strong demand for firms that have thrived during the pandemic. 
Shares of the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) rival opened at $43.50 compared with the IPO price of $36 per share. Freshworks joins a wave of tech listings this week, as the company sees higher demand from customers embracing the hybrid work model.
Founded in the Indian city of Chennai, Freshworks has a suite of products that helps businesses with customer management, such as a messaging platform and an artificial-intelligence powered chatbot for customer support.
""Our products are even more relevant today in the post pandemic world"", said Girish Mathrubootham, chief executive at Freshworks. ""Every business wants to engage better with their customers through online digital channels, and they want to enable their employees to work from home.”
The listing is also widely celebrated by the tech community in India, who sees Freshworks as the first homegrown software as a service (SaaS) company to go public in the U.S.
""Freshworks could be the torchbearer for a whole new generation of entrepreneurs in India. We think that there's embedded product and tech talent and entrepreneurs everywhere,"" said Sameer Gandhi, partner at Accel, an early investor in Freshworks. 
Founded by Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy, Freshworks raised its first round of funds in 2011 and got its first customer, the Atwell College in Australia, in the same year. Its backers include Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.
San Mateo, California-headquartered Freshworks said it serves more than 50,000 companies, including high-profile names such as Delivery Hero SE, Swedish payments firm Klarna and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).

(Reuters) -A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel could vote on the use of a third shot of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, an agency official said at a public meeting of the panel on Wednesday.
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is meeting on Sept 22-23 to weigh which populations would most benefit from a third shot as it awaits a decision on authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Pfizer has asked the FDA to approve the third shot for all people aged 16 and over, but a panel of outside advisors to the FDA last Friday said there was only evidence for a shot being needed by people aged 65 and older. The FDA has not yet said how it plans to proceed. 
The CDC panel considered presentations from staff showing how the vaccine worked in different age groups and populations, including older adults, those whose jobs put them at increased risk for exposure such as healthcare workers, and adults with underlying medical conditions. 
Several of the presentations showed vaccine efficacy in older adults against hospitalization was falling, impacted both by the Delta variant and possible waning of vaccine efficacy over time.
Pfizer officials reviewed the case it presented last week to the FDA advisory panel arguing that a booster is needed for all populations.
CDC staff also reviewed U.S. studies on vaccine effectiveness across U.S. populations and found significant declines in effectiveness against infection for vaccines based on messenger RNA technology during the period when the Delta variant was predominant. 

The studies also showed protection from hospitalization declined more in those vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine than the one made by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. during the time when the Delta variant was predominant. 
Similar patterns of reduced vaccine effectiveness were seen in the general adult population.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies have retained strong profit margins through the pandemic because they have cut costs and passed along high prices to customers. The question is: How long can this go on?
With inflation still strong, the ability for companies to keep margins at record levels is being closely watched by some investors and strategists as third-quarter earnings reports from S&P 500 companies are set to arrive next month.
Much-stronger-than-expected earnings have been a key support for stocks this year even as the coronavirus pandemic has dragged on. The S&P 500 index is up about 17% for the year so far.
Given the way companies have been handling costs, profit margins should edge higher in the near term, said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities in New York.
""Companies are doing a great job of managing costs in a difficult environment,"" he said, and that's led to ""really robust profit margins.""
""This isn't going to go on forever, but will it go on for just a little bit longer? The answer is yes.""
For the second quarter, the operating profit margin for S&P 500 companies was at an estimated 13.54%, surpassing the first quarter's 13.02%, which was also a record, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. 
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to increase 29.5% in the third quarter after a whopping 96% jump in earnings for the second quarter, when year-ago comparisons were much easier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.
In a reversal of the recent trend, analysts have been slightly reducing third-quarter earnings estimates, data showed. 
Businesses have been facing increased costs because of shortages related to the coronavirus pandemic of raw materials and willing workers.
BofA Securities strategists wrote in a recent note that some signs suggest that inflation has shifted from being a tailwind to a headwind. ""When married with slowing macro data, companies may have a harder time passing through cost inflation,"" they wrote. 
A key factor for margins is the spread between costs and the ability of firms to pass those costs on,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists wrote this week.
The gap between the consumer price index and producer price index ""has turned deeply negative as high commodity prices, rising logistical and distribution costs and higher wages are outpacing merchant end prices — a scenario that raises risks for company profits in the next 12 months,"" they said.
Recent PPI data has suggested that high inflation is likely to persist for a while as the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic continues to pressure supply chains. That has led some economists to cut their estimates for third-quarter economic growth.
U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 11 years.
A lot depends on what changes in the coming months.

""In the very short run here, it's hard to read too much into these numbers,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
If economic growth slows and wage growth slows, there's less of an issue for companies, he said. But, ""it's hard to see how things get better from an operating margins standpoint.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) said on Wednesday it plans to begin testing cryptocurrency wallets next month, with a broader rollout in early 2022, allowing its users to move supported digital currencies in and out of their brokerage accounts.
The Menlo Park-based retail brokerage currently allows buying, selling and holding of certain cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and dogecoin, and last quarter saw crypto transactions exceed equities transactions for the first time.
Customers of Robinhood, which benefited from a boom in retail trading during the pandemic, have long asked for crypto wallets, which would allow them to participate more broadly in blockchain-based ecosystems, such as buying virtual assets like non-fungible tokens (NTFs) on the Ethereum network.
""This is the natural next step for us when we think about democratizing finance for all, being able to have a lot more people from a lot of different contexts participate in this emerging market, and wallets are the key,"" Aparna Chennapragada, Robinhood's chief product officer, said in an interview.""
The company plans to survey its current crypto-trading customers, which make up around 60% of the app's 21.3 million active users, and pick small group of respondents to begin testing the new wallets and provide feedback, Chennapragada said.
Robinhood customers can also join a wait list for future access to the wallets as part of a phased rollout, she said.
The wallets will include security features such as identity verification, multi-factor authentication, and email and phone verification to keep coins safe from hacks and other threats, the company said.

""One of the things we've been trying to do is make sure that this is built safely, built securely,"" which was one of the main challenges in developing the new feature, said Chennapragada.
Robinhood said it would maintain 0% commissions for crypto trades once the wallets are launched.

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus led a chorus of pledges by aviation leaders to cut emissions under an eco-friendly new slogan on Wednesday, but was forced to defend its jet-selling business under criticism from campaigners urging the industry to tame its growth.
The European company, which last year announced plans to develop a hydrogen-powered airplane from 2035, said aviation could only hit net-zero carbon emissions in 2050 if airports, airlines and air traffic systems also embraced radical change.
""Reaching net zero will be the result of a truly unparalleled act of cooperation,"" Executive Vice President Julie Kitcher told the ""Airbus Summit"", attended by policymakers and airlines including easyJet (LON:EZJ) and Lufthansa. 
Alternative fuels, lightweight materials and a long-awaited overhaul of air traffic systems are needed, Airbus said. But delegates were warned the transition could also force up fares.
Days before German elections that could reshape European green politics, Airbus road-tested a new slogan designed to link its own brand and an under-pressure aviation industry with sustainability: ""The world is a beautiful place"". 
Replacing the earlier catchphrase ""We make it fly"", the rebranding could be contentious with green groups. It nonetheless reflects a shift in industry boardroom priorities - from winning the race to develop iconic machines, to overcoming the climate concerns of politicians and investors.
Speakers at the polished event at the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters were supplied with ""key messages,"" though Airbus did for the first time provide a platform for industry critics.
Transport & Environment, which advocates tighter controls on aviation, accused the industry of chipping away at regulation while appearing to be supportive over environmental goals.
It challenged Airbus to stop selling new short-haul jets in Europe from 2035, the date at which it says it will have the hydrogen-powered model available for about 100 passengers.
""If we can't mandate the solution, we should at least begin phasing out the problem,"" Aviation Director Andrew Murphy said.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury defended the sale of new jets, saying it was the best way to cut emissions quickly, pending solutions that include hydrogen power for smaller jets.
""We don't need to stop selling new planes; on the contrary, we need to accelerate the replacement of old planes ... given the speed at which we reduce fuel burn,"" he said.
Only 10% of planes in service already use the cleanest technology available today, Airbus said.
RARE UNITY
Industry executives at the two-day, in-person and webcast event agreed on the need for sweeping public and private investment and a ""level global playing field"" in the race to reduce carbon emissions, for which jetliners account for 2-3%.
Observers said the event marshalled rare unity in an industry struggling to shed the carbon tag and meet opposition from activists and some policymakers, especially in Europe. 
Yet cracks appeared over how quickly to adopt low-emission bio-based fuels, which cost three times more than kerosene.
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren - locked in a battle with legacy carriers over who should bear the brunt of a new European Union mandate to use more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) - dismissed it as a meaningful long-term solution.
But the chief executive of London's Heathrow urged airlines to kickstart use of the fuel, which manufacturers concede will be the main option for long-haul flights for decades.
""If we don't get to net zero by 2050 we won't have a business. The faster we scale up SAF the faster we can decarbonise aviation,"" John Holland-Kaye said.
Watching in the audience were some of the financiers who have tens of billions riding on aviation's ability to overcome environmental pressure and tackle huge technical challenges.

""Some of it may be for public consumption but there's a real authenticity from Airbus. They have got to start somewhere,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital. 
""It can't be one solution. This is something Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and engine makers should be working on together. It's as big a collective challenge as the COVID vaccine.""

(Reuters) -Apple Inc has blacklisted ""Fortnite"" from the iPhone maker's popular App Store for several years until all the court appeals are done, Epic Games Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said on Wednesday.
Epic Games' opening brief in its appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is due Dec. 12, according to a court filing and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s reply is due by Jan. 20, 2022. The full appeal process could take years.
Sweeney took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday, calling out Apple's move and said the company will continue to fight the tech giant.
""This is another extraordinary anticompetitive move by Apple, demonstrating their power to reshape markets and choose winners and losers,"" Sweeney said on Twitter https:// The two companies have been locked in a legal dispute since August last year when the game maker tried to get around Apple's 30% fee on some in-app purchases on the App Store by launching its own in-app payment system. The U.S. tech giant is facing a raft of other legal and regulatory challenges to rules it forces game makers to follow, including the closely watched antitrust lawsuit brought by Epic Games. Apple confirmed the authenticity of the letter that Sweeney shared, but declined to comment further. Apple has not yet said whether it will ask for the injunction to be paused pending the appeal process. ""Epic committed an intentional breach of contract, and breach of trust, by concealing code from Apple and making related misrepresentations and omissions,"" the iPhone maker told Epic Games, according to the letter shared by Sweeney. Developers have long criticized Apple's commissions of between 15% and 30% on many App Store purchases, what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.  
Earlier this month, a U.S. federal judge struck down some of Apple's App Store rules, forcing the company to allow developers to send their users to other payment systems in a partial win for Epic Games and other app makers. Apple's shares were up 1.3% at $145.26 on Wednesday.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 02:02PM ET</span>","Soaring gas prices ripple through heavy industry, supply chains","By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Susanna Twidale and Roslan Khasawneh
LONDON (Reuters) - Global record high natural gas prices are pushing some energy-intensive companies to curtail production in a trend that is adding to disruptions to global supply chains in some sectors such as food and could result in higher costs being passed on to their customers.
Some companies, including steel producers, fertiliser manufacturers and glass makers, have had to suspend or reduce production in Europe and Asia as a result of spiking energy prices. That includes two of the world’s largest fertiliser makers, which said they would cut production in Europe. The UK on Tuesday said it agreed to provide state support to one of the companies to restart production of by-product carbon dioxide, which is used in food production, to avert a supply crunch.
Natural gas prices have risen sharply around the globe in recent months. That has been due to a combination of factors: including increased demand particularly from Asia due to a post-pandemic recovery; low gas inventories; and tighter-than-usual gas supplies from Russia.
Gas prices in Europe have risen more than 250% this year, while Asia has seen about a 175% increase since late January. In the United States, prices have surged to multi-year highs and are about double where they were at the start of the year. Electricity prices have also risen sharply as many power plants are gas-fired.
Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a trade group representing chemical, food and materials manufacturers, has in recent days called on the U.S. Department of Energy to stop the country's liquefied natural gas producers from exporting gas to help keep the energy costs down for industry.
Additional supplies of gas could alleviate pressure. Norway has allowed increased gas exports. More supply could flow from Russia by the end of the year with the country’s new Nord Stream 2 pipeline awaiting approval from Germany’s energy regulator. The pipeline project has drawn criticism from the United States, which says it will increase Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies.
PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS
The pressures so far have been particularly acute in Europe, where gas stocks are much lower than usual heading into winter. Norway’s Yara International (OTC:YARIY) ASA, one of the world’s largest fertiliser makers, on Friday said it would cut about 40% of its European ammonia production due to high gas prices. That came after U.S.-based CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) said gas prices were prompting it to halt operations at two of its British plants. Natural gas is the most important cost input for nitrogen-based chemicals and fertilizers.
Yara’s chief executive, Svein Tore Holsether, told Reuters in an interview Monday that the company was bringing ammonia to Europe from production facilities elsewhere, including the United States and Australia. ""Instead of using European gas, we are essentially using gas from other parts of the world to make that product and bring it into Europe,"" he said.CF Industries didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Some industries are calling on governments to intervene on their behalf. These pleas come as some countries have acted to protect consumers from soaring energy bills, such as Spain, which last week approved a package of measures including price caps.
Among those asking for help is the food industry following a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by the suspension of production in some fertiliser plants. CO2 is used in the vacuum packing of food products to extend their shelf life, to stun animals before slaughter and to put the fizz in soft drinks and beer.
In the UK, meat processors had warned they will run out of CO2 within five days, forcing them to halt production. Soft drink manufacturers, who rely on the gas to make carbonated drinks, said supplies were running low.
On Tuesday, the British government said it struck a three-week deal with CF Industries for the American company to restart the production of carbon dioxide in the UK. Britain’s environment minister, who said the state support could run into tens of millions of pounds, also warned the food industry that carbon dioxide prices would rise sharply.
CF Industries said in a statement it is immediately restarting ammonia production at its Billingham plant following the agreement.
WEATHERING THE STORM
Other energy-intensive sectors such as steel and cement are also feeling the pinch.
Soaring gas prices have in the past couple of weeks ""forced some steelmakers to suspend operations during those periods of the night and day when the cost of energy rockets,"" said Gareth Stace, director general at industry group UK Steel. He declined to identify which companies.
British Steel, the country’s second-largest steel producer, said it was maintaining normal levels of production but that the “colossal” energy-price increases made “it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day.”
Some manufacturers say they are able to cope, so far.
Germany’s Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG), Europe’s second-largest steelmaker, said hedging mechanisms it had in place against energy price increases, especially gas, meant it was not curbing production. But it said it was indirectly affected because the industrial gases it used are linked to electricity prices.
HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) AG of Germany, the world’s second-largest cement maker, said higher energy prices were driving up production costs but that operations had not been halted as a result.
In China, several steel, ceramic and glass makers have reduced production to avoid losses, according to Li Ruipeng, a local supplier of liquefied natural gas in the northern province of Hebei. And, China’s southwestern province of Yunnan this month imposed limits on production of some heavy industries, including producers of fertilisers, cement, chemicals, and aluminium smelters due to energy shortages, a move that analysts said could reduce exports.
To weather the storm, some energy-intensive industries and utility firms in Asia and the Middle East have temporarily switched from gas to fuel oil, crude, naphtha or coal, analysts and traders said. That trend is expected to continue for the rest of the year and into the beginning of next, according to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog.

In Europe, demand for coal as an alternative power source has also risen significantly. But options for switching to alternative sources of energy are limited in the region largely due to government policies aimed at encouraging the use of gas over more polluting fuels such as coal.
The glass industry was historically run on fuel oil, but almost all sites in the United Kingdom have now transitioned to natural gas, according to Paul Pearcy, federation coordinator at British Glass, a UK trade association. Only a few sites have fuel oil tanks that enable them to switch energy source if prices skyrocket, he added.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Inc is facing claims that it unlawfully denied religious and medical exemptions from a requirement that employees receive COVID-19 vaccines after allegedly making it difficult for workers to apply for them. 
Six United employees filed a class action in Texas federal court on Tuesday claiming that workers who sought exemptions from the vaccine mandate were subjected to intrusive inquiries about their medical conditions or religious beliefs, including a requirement that they obtain letters from pastors.
Chicago-based United in a statement said the lawsuit was without merit, and that it has seen an overwhelmingly positive response from employees since announcing its vaccine requirement last month. More than 97% of United's U.S.-based employees are vaccinated, the airline said. 
The lawsuit highlights the thorny legal issues faced by employers in mandating vaccines, and comes as President Joe Biden is seeking to require companies with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 weekly. 
The plaintiffs on Wednesday asked the court to temporarily bar enforcement of United's mandate for employees who request exemptions. United has required workers to receive at least the first dose of a vaccine by Sept. 27 or face termination, according to the lawsuit.
The airline has already faced a separate legal challenge to its vaccine mandate, which was dismissed by a U.S. judge in Florida last week. The judge said that lawsuit was not filed properly. 
The plaintiffs in Tuesday's lawsuit say United gave employees only until Aug. 31 to request religious or medical exemptions from the vaccine requirement, and that it has automatically denied requests filed after that deadline.

They accused United of violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on religion and disability. 
The workers are seeking to represent a nationwide class that they said would likely include more than 2,000 United employees.

Elkann said Stellantis had invested 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) in Turin to produce full-electric cars - including the battery-electric (BEV) Fiat 500 - and hybrid ones along with innovative projects, such as smart-grid recharging infrastructure.
The investment is a ""clear and important sign that we believe not only in all the women and men who work there, but also in the entire automotive district of the city,"" Elkann said.
Group executives presented a red-coloured version of its 500 electric model to be produced in the Turin site, in partnership with RED, the charity group co-founded by U2 frontman Bono.
Turin's Mirafiori plant is one of the largest in Italy and a symbol for the carmaker. 
""My father drove a Fiat, my first car was a Fiat, although I crashed,"" Bono said, unexpectedly showing up at the event presenting the 'Casa 500' museum and a roof garden at Fiat's historical Lingotto plant in Turin. 
Like other major automakers, Stellantis, which employs around 55,000 people in Italy, has been hit by a global chip shortage crisis which has forced it to repeatedly halt plants, reduce shifts and cut temporary workers.

Speaking at the same event, Fiat brand CEO Olivier Francois said the brand aims to unveil a new model every year, starting from 2023, each with its BEV version.

The flurry of trades with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY) -- which took place between 10:34 a.m. and 10:41 a.m. New York time -- involved call spreads maturing in each of the next three months. The total cost was about $50 million. Should all the contracts be in the money by their respective expiration dates, they would be worth $136 million -- for a profit of roughly 70%, according to an estimate from Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna. 
“These trades all share very similar footprint,” said Murphy. “It could be someone who is underweight equities and says, ‘if this thing explodes to the upside by the end of the year, then I’m going to be in trouble. So why don’t I put on a couple of these call spreads just to cover myself?’ That’s one situation. Or it could be someone who’s bullish getting more bullish.”
The transactions occurred right before the Federal Reserve’s policy decision. The S&P 500 climbed more than 1% Wednesday, snapping a four-day decline, as concerns about China Evergrande Group’s debt woes eased. Down 2.6% in September, the index is heading for its worst month in almost a year. 
It “seems like someone putting money to work to play for a rally into year-end following the recent selloff,” said Danny Kirsch, head of options at Cornerstone Macro LLC. “Interesting they’re also doing it in front of the Fed meeting, perhaps think the outcome will be market positive.”

However, investors’ shifting interest toward tech stocks helped the index recover quickly. Furthermore, the Chinese government’s intervention to support Evergrande could spur a rally in the market. Given this backdrop, we think prominent Nasdaq 100 stocks Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), and  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) could generate exceptional returns in the near term. Read on.September has been a bumpy ride for the stock market, with the major indices ending last week with marginal losses. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 witnessed its worst day since May this Monday as investors exhibited concern about the Federal Reserve’s meeting this week, surging COVID-19 cases, and possible financial market contagion from China’s big property developer Evergrande’s liquidity crisis. However, the tech-heavy index roared back in Tuesday’s session as investors shifted their attention to tech stocks.
Although the anxiety surrounding the Evergrande Group’s potential default on interest payments has kept the market on edge, economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research believes that the Chinese government would not let the real estate firm fail. And its intervention could drive relief rallies in the major indices.
Given this backdrop, investors remain bullish about prominent Nasdaq 100 stocks’ strong momentum lately. Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA), and Gartner, Inc. (IT) possess solid growth potential and we think are well-positioned to keep soaring.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has been on a boutique-business buying spree this year, acquiring or investing in around 30 companies since the start of 2021.
In September alone, the bank took a close-to 75% stake in Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s payments, bought the media company that owns Zagat and on Tuesday bought a college financial planning used by more than 5 million students in the United States.
Those three transactions illustrate the contours of JPMorgan's dealmaking strategy, analysts and bank executives said: the largest U.S. bank is filling the few holes left in its offerings, without facing regulatory hurdles that would almost surely accompany larger transactions.
""These are acquisitions that are bite-sized and span a full range from payments to big data, have applications for AI and (provide) premium customer experiences,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) bank analyst Mike Mayo.
""It's another reason Goliath is winning,"" he added. ""They can go ahead and pick off forward-looking, niche fintech firms and scale them across their global franchise.""
While most deals and their terms are not public information, Reuters estimates JPMorgan has bought and invested in around 30 companies in 2021, according to data from Refinitiv, Dealogic and media reports.
The average size of the deals the bank has done this year are smaller than at almost any point in the past decade, Dealogic found, counting only deals where the value was disclosed. Average deal size last year was smaller. 
Only in 2012 did JPMorgan do more deals, according to Dealogic. The bank made 34 investments and acquisitions that year, again counting only those deals with disclosed values.
""The benefit of our franchise is our scale,"" said Leslie Wims Morris, who heads corporate development for Chase. ""It's less about deal size than it is about strategic impact: what capabilities do we need, and what experiences do we want to deliver?"" 
DEALS APLENTY 
JPMorgan is not alone in its pursuits lately. Rivals have also been buying companies or stakes in companies that thrive on algorithms, apps, data and a specific appeal to desirable customers in markets where they do not have a foothold.
For instance,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) last week purchased home-improvement lender for $2.2 billion, and on Tuesday Wells Fargo & Co and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) participated in a $60 million funding round for Bilt Rewards, a credit-card loyalty startup that targets renters. 
Although some of the deals are sizable enough to warrant announcing the purchase price, they are generally smaller and less meaningful than the mega-bank mergers that happened in the 1990s and 2000s.
U.S. regulators have been loath to approve transactions that help the biggest financial firms get bigger. That is especially true under the Biden administration, which has a stated policy of cracking down on anticompetitive practices and whose Justice Department effectively quashed a merger between two large insurance brokers in July.
There is also an issue of profitability relative to size. The larger U.S. banks become, the more capital they must hold against certain assets. Because JPMorgan is so large, it makes sense to target companies that provide services for fees or can offer data about customer preferences, said Odeon Capital Group analyst Richard Bove.
""JPMorgan does not want to grow its balance sheet, but it does want to grow its profits,"" he said.
That dynamic, combined with JPMorgan's saturation across the United States, explains its 75% stake in Volkswagen Payments SA; its acquisition of UK digital wealth manager Nutmeg ; and a 40% stake in C6 Bank, a popular digital lender in Brazil, he said.
Investing internationally also gives JPMorgan an edge over domestic competitors like  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which has exited large chunks of its global consumer operations, analysts said.
JPMorgan is considering large deals too, but some of the transactions this year simply came together faster, said Ben Hesse, head of the bank's strategy & business development for asset & wealth management unit. 

His division oversaw recent purchases of ESG-focused fintech startup OpenInvest, forest manager and timberlands investor Campbell Global LLC and a minority stake in Kraft Analytics Group, the sports-focused data analytics firm.
""Just because we haven't announced anything large doesn't mean we haven't looked at it,"" Hesse told Reuters. ""It's just that the bar for these things is very, very high.""

480,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 01:12PM ET</span>",Explainer-Why record high British natgas prices caused a crisis over CO2 supplies,"By Nigel Hunt
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain warned its food producers on Wednesday to prepare for a 400% rise in carbon dioxide prices after paying tens of million of pounds to get CF Fertilisers to restart production in a deal that will last for three weeks.
The deal buys Britain some time to secure suppliers from other sources as it seeks to prevent the shutdown on production of a wide range of food and drinks.
WHY IS CARBON DIOXIDE IMPORTANT?
The food and drink industry is the largest user of carbon dioxide with the gas used in a wide range of beverages including beer and soft drinks.
In the meat sector, it is also used to stun animals prior to slaughter while bakers often use it in a packaging process which prolongs the life of products such as crumpets and cakes.
The gas has many other applications outside of food and drink including in medicine where it is used during a wide range of procedures from non-invasive surgery to the removal of warts.
The energy sector is also an important consumer with the nuclear industry, for example, using it as a coolant.
HOW IT IS PRODUCED?
Carbon dioxide is a by-product in the production of some fertilisers and biofuels.
In Britain, the largest sources include U.S. company CF Fertilisers' plant in Billingham in northeast England and the company's Ince plant in north-west England.
HOW IT IS TRADED?
Fertiliser producers sell carbon dioxide to industrial gas companies such as Linde (NYSE:LIN) and Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) who purify it to the required standard before selling it to consumers.
Carbon dioxide is sold through a mixture of contracts and spot sales.
WHY IS THERE A SHORTAGE?
CF Fertilisers halted production at its two British fertiliser plants last week due to soaring prices of natural gas, a key input in the production process. 
British wholesale gas benchmark prices have more than tripled this year to record highs due to several factors including low inventory levels, strong demand in Asia, making it difficult to get liquefied natural gas shipments and maintenance issues.
This effectively removed a large chunk of supply from the market and there have been reports that carbon dioxide suppliers were not scheduling beyond 24 hours in advance.
Many consumers only have sufficient reserves of the gas to last a few days and this created fears that production of a wide range of products could be quickly brought to a halt.
CAN IMPORTS FILL THE SUPPLY GAP?
Britain does import carbon dioxide from Norway and the Netherlands but supply from these sources appears uncertain. Norway's Yara announced last week it was curtailing fertiliser production following the rise in natural gas prices while available supplies from the Netherlands may remain within the European Union as the shortage of carbon dioxide spreads across the continent.
WILL FOOD AND DRINK PRICES RISE?

Carbon dioxide accounts for only a small proportion of the overall cost of producing food and drink so a rise in its cost is unlikely to lead to a significant jump in prices.
However, the rise in energy prices which led to the shortage of carbon dioxide is likely to stoke inflation as it makes it more expensive to grow, process and transport food and drink.

Net revenue at its pet foods unit jumped 25% in the first quarter, benefiting from a rise in the adoption of cats and dogs by people looking to ease the stress of the more than a year-long pandemic.
General Mills has also launched new items such as Tastefuls cat food and bought  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN)' pet treats business to take advantage of the demand surge.
That helped drive total net sales 4.1% higher to $4.54 billion, beating the analysts' average estimate of $4.29 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
General Mills shares were 2% higher as it maintained its forecast for annual organic net sales to come in toward the higher end of a 1% to 3% decline range. 
The reported quarter showed that demand for cereals, snacks and baking products continued to recede from last year's pandemic peak, with the core North America retail business posting a 3% fall. 
The Betty Crocker cake mixes maker's gross margins also shrank 1.2%, taking a hit from higher transportation costs, labor shortages and a surge in raw material prices that have impacted the entire packaged foods industry.
""The current operating environment is as dynamic as we’ve experienced in at least the last decade,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in his pre-recorded remarks. 
He added that the company expected total input cost inflation for the year to be roughly 7% to 8%, up from a prior estimate of 7%.

Quarterly net earnings attributable to General Mills fell 2% to $627 million, or $1.02 per share.
On an adjusted basis, it earned 99 cents per share, compared with estimates of 89 cents per share.

Bluebell said in a letter to GSK Chairman Jonathan Symonds that chief executive Emma Walmsley should reapply for her job as she would have “renewed credibility both internally and externally”, the FT report said.
Earlier this year, activist Elliott had also taken a stake in GSK, calling for a leadership change at the company. Bluebell was largely backing Elliott's demands, the FT said.
GSK confirmed Bluebell had made demands in a letter. 
""We continue to engage extensively with our shareholders with over 500 meetings so far this year,"" GSK said in a statement.
""They have expressed widespread and strong support for our plans to deliver a step-change in growth and performance, and given clear direction to focus on execution,"" the company added.
The British pharma major, with a market value of over 71 billion pounds ($96.95 billion), in July rejected Elliott's demands to change its board and sell its consumer healthcare arm.
GSK has set out plans to turn its consumer healthcare arm into a separately listed company, in a move that will deliver an 8 billion pound windfall and other financial benefits to boost drug development at its underperforming pharma business.

Bluebell was part of a successful investor campaign to oust Danone chairman and chief executive Emmanuel Faber in March.

LONDON (Reuters) -A surge in fraud attacks on consumers since the pandemic has become a 'national security threat' for Britain, requiring government-coordinated action across industries, banking lobby group UK Finance has warned.
Financial fraud has rocketed during the pandemic as more consumers shop online and try digital banking and investing. 
The UK Finance warning came as British lawmakers on Wednesday criticised bosses at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for not doing enough to prevent the spate of online scams.
Criminals stole 754 million pounds ($1.03 billion) through bank frauds in the first half of this year, up 30% on the same period in 2020, the lobby group said in a report.
Bank losses from authorised push payment (APP) fraud - where a customer is tricked into a payment by a criminal - also leapt 71% in the first half, overtaking the amount stolen through card fraud for the first time, UK Finance said. 
Lenders have been pushing for tougher action on fraud by the government, regulators and other industries including online platforms exploited by fraudsters to target victims, as they grapple with a wave of increasingly sophisticated attacks.
The report found 70% of APP scams originated on an online platform and also found an increase in online adverts targeting people as young as 14 to become ""money mules"" for illicit funds.
UK Finance called for government-coordinated action across sectors and for all economic crime to be covered by a planned Online Safety Bill, which currently excludes online advertisements.
""The level of fraud in the UK is such that it is now a national security threat,"" Katy Worobec, managing director for economic crime at UK Finance said in the report. ""The banking sector cannot solve this on its own.""
'MAKING A MOCKERY' 
Lawmakers on Britain's Treasury Select Committee told tech company bosses during a hearing on economic crime that the problem had got out of hand, accusing them of enabling fraud.
""Google's made a mockery of the regulator of this country, by expecting the regulator to take down fraudulent stuff on the site, and have to pay for it,"" lawmaker Rushanara Ali said. 
Google has offered the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's regulator, $1.5 million in advertising credits to help cover the cost of fraud awareness campaigns. 
""We want them to take up those ad credits,"" Amanda Storey, Google's director of trust and safety for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. The tech firm intends to offer $3.5 million of advertisement credits to other scam awareness campaigns.
Google has prohibited investment ads that are not FCA-authorised - including for gold and cryptocurrencies - since Sept. 6 this year, Storey added.
The tech firms said they were investing in fraud prevention and collaborating with the government and regulators.
""We're actually the first line of defence, rather than an enabler,"" Gaon Hart, head of public policy for customer trust at Amazon UK & Ireland said. 

Neither Google nor Facebook were able to say if they had ever compensated customers for losses from fraud, though Amazon said it had.

(Reuters) - As California struggles with another crippling drought, a Silicon Valley startup that believes robots can grow produce more sustainably said Wednesday it raised $50 million in a funding round led by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
Iron Ox uses robots that are integrated with a hydroponic system consuming 90% less water than traditional farms, said CEO Brandon Alexander.
The company is putting that system to work at a 10,000-square foot (930 square meter) greenhouse in Gilroy, California, where a self-driving robot named Grover moves pallets of Genovese Basil and a robotic arm system lifts the pallets for inspection. Sensors check the water for nitrogen and acidity levels for healthy growth. 
""Then they say, 'What is missing? What does that plant need that we're not giving it',"" Alexander said. Any water not used can be pumped back into the system to be reused later.
Agriculture plays an important role in California's economy, but water usage is increasingly in the spotlight. The last major drought in 2012-2017 cut irrigation for farmers, forced strict household conservation measures and stoked deadly wildfires.
Iron Ox grows Thai basil and strawberries and is working on cilantro, parsley, and tomatoes. The company is also building a new 535,000-square-foot greenhouse in Lockhart, Texas, 30 miles (48 km) south of Austin. 
Alexander said hydroponics - saving water by growing plants without soil - is just one piece of the puzzle for future farming.

""To really eliminate waste, to really get to that next level of sustainability and impact, we have to rethink the entire grow process,"" he said.
The funding round included investors from Crosslink Capital, R7 Partners, and Pathbreaker Ventures, among others. Iron Ox declined to comment on its valuation.

(Reuters) - Are sneakerheads in for a rough holiday season?
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE)'s updates to its full-year sales outlook on Thursday will likely answer that pressing question for Wall Street as the world's largest sportswear maker deals with unprecedented supply challenges ahead of the holiday season.
Three months ago, Nike gave a rosy outlook for the rest of the year as it benefited from consumers splurging on sneakers for running and hiking as they returned to their routines after over a year of staying at home.
Still, some analysts have cut their outlook for Nike's sales, predicting that lockdowns and factory closures in Vietnam, where about half of all Nike footwear is manufactured, will cause shortages during the crucial shopping season.
""We believe the risk of significant cancellations beginning this holiday and running through at least next spring has risen materially for Nike as it is now facing at least two months of virtually no unit production at its Vietnamese factories,"" BTIG analysts wrote in a note. 
Graphic: Where Nike gets its products made: https://graphics.reuters.com/NIKE-RESULTS/zgpombjewpd/chart.png 
THE CONTEXT
Many factories in Vietnam's manufacturing hubs have been shut or are operating with drastically fewer on-floor workers since mid-July as a surge in Delta variant cases forced the government to implement tight containment policies.
Other apparel companies including Abercrombie & Fitch and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) have taken a hit to their businesses due to production issues in Vietnam.
Some analysts, however, see Nike using its scale to offset the sales impact from Vietnam shutdowns.
""The company should be able to mitigate some headwind by shifting production to other countries, like China, and prioritizing top sellers, key products, and its DTC (direct-to-consumer) channel,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Since the start of September, analysts have cut their full-year sales expectations for Nike to $49.81 billion from $50.34 billion due to worries about supply shortages
* Full-year earnings per share estimates have also fallen to $4.24 from $4.33, according to IBES data from Refinitiv
* Nike's revenue for the reporting quarter is expected to have risen 17.7% to $12.46 billion from a year earlier
* The blue-chip stock has gained 11% this year, but is down about 10% from its record high hit in August 
WALL STREET SENTIMENT
* The current average analyst rating on NKE shares is ""buy"", with 28 rating it ""strong buy"" or ""buy"", four rating it a ""hold"" and one rating it a ""strong sell"".

The company expects to complete the testing of the van in the December quarter. The vehicle has a range of 100 miles and is powered by a 70-kilowatt-hour battery.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>",Explainer - Here's what we know about how U.S. will lift travel restrictions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration plans to ease in early November COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions that have barred people from much of the world from entering the United States starting in early 2020.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still must issue a formal order that will provide details on the new rules and when they will begin.
Here is a look at the U.S. travel restriction policy.
WHO CAN TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES? 
- The United States will lift travel restrictions on 33 countries https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html including China, India, Brazil, Iran, South Africa and most of Europe for travelers who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 that were imposed starting in early 2020.
- Travelers (NYSE:TRV) will still need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days of departing for the United States.
- Until the new rules take effect, most foreign nationals who have been in the 33 countries for 14 days prior to departure cannot travel to the United States.
- Foreign nationals from all countries, with few exceptions, will need vaccinations to travel to the United States by air.
- The CDC has not yet said whether foreign nationals who recently had COVID-19 and are not currently eligible to be vaccinated will be allowed to travel to the United States.
WHAT VACCINES WILL BE ACCEPTED?
- It is not certain what vaccines the CDC will accept beyond the three already authorized in the United States - those from Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - or what proof must be presented. The Biden administration told airlines on Tuesday that it was still deciding what vaccines will be accepted.
- The CDC pointed to its prior guidance when asked by Reuters what vaccines it will accept. ""The CDC considers someone fully vaccinated with any FDA-authorized or approved vaccines and any vaccines that (the World Health Organization) has authorized,"" spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said.
WHAT ROLES WILL AIRLINES PLAY?
- It is expected that travelers will need to sign a form attesting to their vaccination and airlines will check passengers' documents to certify compliance with the vaccine rules.
- Airlines currently check for proof of a negative COVID-19 test before travelers depart.
- The CDC will also issue new contact-tracing rules before the restrictions are lifted that will require international passengers to give email and phone contact information so public health authorities can reach them if needed, including if they are seated near someone who tests positive for COVID-19.
WHAT HAPPENS TO UNVACCINATED AMERICAN TRAVELERS?
- Americans traveling from abroad who are not vaccinated will face tougher rules than those who are vaccinated, including needing to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within a day of travel and proof of purchasing a viral test to be taken after arrival. Vaccinated Americans must show proof of a negative test within three days of returning to the United States.

- Exceptions from the vaccine requirements include children not yet eligible for shots.
- The Biden administration expects humanitarian exemptions will be granted for certain foreign nationals who agree to be vaccinated upon arrival in the United States, according to a White House official and a document seen by Reuters. The Biden administration expects such exemptions will be very limited.

The European luxury sector has seen a fast pace of growth in recent months, as stores reopened following lockdown periods and consumers drew on money saved during periods of confinement to splash out on pricey goods.
LVMH has more than recovered business lost to pandemic disruptions. In July, it reported first half sales grew 11 percent on an organic basis compared to the same period in 2019, before the crisis hit, fuelled by demand for clothing and accessories from its star fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Dior.
The company’s focus on recruiting younger staff comes as it seeks to bolster the popularity of its brands with younger consumers, weaving streetwear styles like cargo pants and sneakers into its luxury fashion collections.
The hiring target for the upcoming year marks an acceleration of around 20 percent compared to previous years, according to Chantal Gaemperle, director of human resources and synergies at LVMH.

The group intends to use various methods to recruit younger staff, including drawing on a company training institute in France and other countries that is focused on design, crafts and sales techniques. It plans to expand training, which covers areas such as pastry baking and vineyard techniques, and further roll out the teaching in countries including Italy, Spain, Germany and Japan. 
Seeking to broaden and diversify its recruitment further still, LVMH is opening a public online training platform and says it has forged partnerships in under-privileged areas in France to recruit high school students for apprenticeships. The group said it expects to grant 2,500 long-term contracts in France along with 5,000 internships in the country, but did not provide further details on the expected geographic breakdown of its hiring plan.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Wednesday it is underreporting the results of its advertising business on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS devices, acknowledging that recent privacy changes from the iPhone maker have made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on Facebook.
Shares of the social media giant were down 3.7% at $344.32 in morning trading.
Facebook said in a blog post it estimates it is underreporting ""conversions,"" an industry term that includes buying of products or other actions a person takes after seeing an ad, by 15%, adding that the figure varied among individual advertisers.
Facebook said it believed actual conversions such as sales and app downloads are higher than reported.
The announcement comes as Facebook and the larger digital advertising industry continues to grapple with the privacy controls implemented by Apple in April https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-do-apples-new-iphone-privacy-changes-mean-consumers-businesses-2021-04-26, which are designed to limit digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users for advertising purposes without their consent.
Facebook fought back https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-bring-changes-advertising-privacy-following-apples-upcoming-ios-update-2021-04-21 against the changes, arguing it would hurt small businesses that rely on targeted advertising to find new customers.

The social media company previously warned investors that there would be ""greater impact"" of the Apple changes on Facebook's ad business during the third quarter compared with its second quarter.
In Wednesday's blog post, Facebook outlined steps advertisers should take to better measure the results of their ads. The company said it is investing in new tools and capabilities to help brands with their marketing amid the Apple changes.

And as investors seek ways to hedge their portfolios against an anticipated market correction, dividend aristocrats in the consumer products industry Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) could attract significant attention. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Atlanta, Ga., and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in New York City are two prominent players in the consumer products industry. KO owns or licenses, and markets beverage concentrates, finished sparkling soft-drinks brands, energy drinks, dairy, and syrups to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores. It operates through independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and bottling and distribution operators. In comparison, CL sells consumer products manufactured under oral, personal, homecare, and pet nutrition segments. It markets and sells its products to various retailers, wholesalers, e-commerce, and distributors.
Because factors including the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, high inflation, and geopolitical tensions, have led to significant market volatility, and many analysts predict a correction in the near term, investors are seeking ways to hedge their portfolios against such market movements. The ability to withstand market volatility thanks to near inelastic demand for products and consistent increases in dividends makes dividend aristocrats KO and CL well-positioned to attract significant investor attention.
While CL has declined 6% in price over the past three months, KO has advanced marginally. KO is a clear winner with 7.2% price gains versus CL’s marginal returns in terms of their past year’s performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

So, let’s examine these names.
Market volatility is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, as investors await the results of this week’s much-anticipated Fed meeting, during which officials are expected to reveal their plans to begin withdrawing assistance to the economy. Furthermore, market experts believe that the current liquidity crisis at China's Evergrande Group, which has jolted global markets, could cause even more volatility in the coming weeks.
Against this backdrop, we think investors could dodge the rising volatility by investing in stocks that have already gained substantial momentum, which they have the potential to maintain owing to their strong fundamentals and solid growth prospects. Investors’ confidence in momentum stocks is evidenced by the Invesco DWA Momentum ETF’s (PDP) 5.8% returns over the past three months.

Investing.com – Zoom Video stock (NASDAQ:ZM) fell 0.6% after a report in The Wall Street Journal suggesting the company’s acquisition of Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) may take more time pending review of its links with China.
Five9 shares traded 0.3% lower.
According to the report, a Justice Department-led panel known as Team Telecom, is reviewing the deal with an eye on national security risks.
The Justice Department has requested the Federal Communications Commission to defer action on the application until Team Telecom finishes its review, according to the report.
Zoom has regularly cited its Silicon Valley headquarters and the U.S. citizenship of its China-born Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan as proof of its U.S. base.  
In April last year, security experts found that in certain cases, Zoom stored encryption keys on servers based in China. The company called it a mistake it won't repeat.
As per the July 18 all-stock offer, Five9 stockholders will receive 0.55 shares of Zoom for each share of the company they hold. This represents a per share price for Five9 stock of $200.28 and values the company at $13.56 billion.
The acquisition is expected to enhance Zoom’s presence with enterprise customers and help the video conferencing service target the $24 billion contact center market.
Five9 is a pioneer of cloud-based contact center software. Its cloud contact center offers applications that allow management of customer interactions across many channels.
The acquisition is complementary to the growing popularity of Zoom's cloud-based phone system that offers a digital alternative to traditional phone systems in offices, Zoom said in its note announcing the offer."

In addition, according to a CFO Dive report, SPAC IPOs plunged 87% during the second quarter. Hence, RSI could also be negatively impacted.
The company reported losses in the second quarter. In addition, hedge fund interest in the stock declined recently. So, RSI’s near-term prospects don’t look very promising.

Ant's virtual credit card service Huabei said in a post on its official Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account on Wednesday that it was being integrated into China's central bank credit reporting system. 
Ant, the financial affiliate of e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, saw its $37 billion IPO derailed by regulators last year and has since been undergoing a Beijing-led restructuring to turn itself into a financial holding firm and curtail some of its freewheeling businesses.
China's large internet platforms have for years tended to resist sharing their data, a crucial asset that helps them run operations, manage risk and attract new customers.

Huabei said in its statement that after obtaining users' prior authorization, it will report information such as the date their account was set up, credit lines and usage to the system. Users' personal consumption details will not be shared, it added. 
Huabei and another Ant credit subsidiary, short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei, were used by around 500 million people in the 12 months to June 30, 2020, Ant said in its IPO prospectus.

508,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 09:37AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher Ahead of Fed on China Relief; Dow up 200 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday but for most stocks it was a case of 'wait-and-see' while the Federal Reserve winds up its latest policy meeting. 
The Fed is expected by many to say when it will start reducing its monthly bond purchases, which have run at $120 billion since the first wave of the pandemic. The market's reaction is likely to be determined by when the Fed starts to 'taper' the purchases, and how long it wants the phasing-out period to be. Attention will also be on the Fed's so-called 'dot plot', to see whether policymakers have accelerated the timeline for future interest rate hikes.
Support came from China, where a vaguely-worded statement from real estate developer China Evergrande put off what many consider to be an unavoidable default by saying it had reached an agreement with holders of an onshore bond on which interest is due on Thursday. It made no mention of other upcoming debt repayments. 
There was also an indication of sustained strength in the housing market, with a 4.9% weekly rise in mortgage applications. Existing home sales data for August are due at 10 AM ET. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 201 points, or 0.6%, at 34,121 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
While the broader market movement was upward, the most notable single-stock movements were generally in the other direction, as earnings updates continued to feed a growing narrative of slowing growth and higher costs that will squeeze profitability. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock fell 7.5% after it warned of higher costs ahead, while Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock fell 4.6% after its quarterly update - while beating expectations, still pointed to a fading of the pandemic-driven growth impulse of the last year and a half. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 2.7% after a series of Wall Street Journal articles detailing its governance shortcomings continued to weigh on it. The stock has fallen nearly 7% since the first of the articles in the series. The company also repeated on Wednesday that changes to Apple's iOS system are hurting its advertising business. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 0.5%.
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock fell another 1.2%, after dropping more than 7% on Tuesday to its lowest in a month on the back of an expensive-looking bid for U.K.-based Entain (OTC:GMVHY). Draftkings sweetened its initial offer, but Entain's board said overnight in London only that it would 'seriously consider' the bid.
On a more positive note,  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) stock rose 16% as the company returned to profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, while Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock extended the gains it made on Tuesday after forecasting its first-ever adjusted EBITDA profit. The stock rose 3.9% to its highest in nearly two months.

509,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 09:32AM ET</span>",Media SPAC led by former CBS chief begins trading on NASDAQ,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Argus Capital, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by former ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and CBS executives targeting media, entertainment and sports investments, is expected to begin trading on the NASDAQ Wednesday, seeking to raise up to $265 million.
It aims to participate in the deal-making frenzy that has defined the media industry this year.
Argus, led by Joseph Ianniello, who ran CBS prior to its merger with Viacom, and Marc DeBevoise, most recently the chief executive officer of ViacomCBS Digital, filed with the SEC in July.
The listing comes at a time when the broader SPAC market has been weighed down by heightened regulatory pressure and saturated demand, with the majority of listed SPACs trading below their initial public offering prices.
In an interview on Tuesday, DeBevoise characterized the company’s acquisition targets as “tech-driven media” with billions of dollars of enterprise value, including spin-offs from conglomerates and other companies.
“From the explosion of devices and connectivity, to streaming becoming mainstream and impacting traditional models…. all of these changes have created a lot of opportunities in our space,” DeBevoise told Reuters.
Special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public through a merger at a later date.
SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation attained and funds raised.

They have become attractive financial vehicles in the media industry, where scale is often necessary to survive. Among other recent deals, in June BuzzFeed agreed to a merger with 890 5th Avenue Partners, valuing it at $1.5 billion net of cash.
Last month the publisher of Forbes magazine said it was going public through a merger with a Hong Kong-based SPAC in a deal that values the combined entity at $630 million.

(Reuters) - Entain's shares hit a record high on Wednesday after the British gambling group received a $22.4 billion takeover proposal from U.S. rival DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), double a bid it rejected from joint venture partner MGM in January.
Dealmaking is picking up in the online gaming industry as the United States opens up to sports betting and players look to build scale and tap the expertise of foreign companies in more developed markets.
Shares in Entain, which owns traditional  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral betting shops as well as newer online brands such as bwin and partypoker, jumped as much as 11% to hit 25 pounds and top London's benchmark index.
That compared with the 28 pounds cash and stock proposal from DraftKings, a 46.2% premium to Entain's closing price on Monday, which followed an earlier approach of 25 pounds rejected by Entain.
""The board of Entain will carefully consider the proposal,"" said Entain, led by new CEO Jette Nygaard-Andersen. DraftKings has until Oct. 19 to either make a firm bid or walk away.
DraftKings' interest comes weeks after it clinched a $1.6 billion deal to buy U.S. rival Golden Nugget.
As for its bet on Entain, analysts said much would depend on the British company's U.S. joint venture partner, MGM, which said any deal that would make Entain a competitor in the United States would require its consent.
JP Morgan analysts said that to win MGM's approval, DraftKings may have to sell Entain's 50% stake in BetMGM to MGM, leaving DraftKings with Entain's rest-of-the-world operations, as well as its technology and expertise.
That would mirror the fate of William Hill, another storied British betting brand that U.S. group Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) bought in a 2.9 billion pound deal earlier this year, only to then sell its non-U.S. operations.
Alternatively, DraftKings could seek to merge with BetMGM, giving MGM a stake in the new company. ""However, the deal would have to be attractive for MGM to give up its desire to have control,"" the JP Morgan analysts said.
AMERICAN EXPANSION 
BetMGM, an online sportsbook for betting on NFL American football and NBA basketball games, controls 21% of the market versus DraftKings' 17%, according to RBC. Flutter-owned FanDuel is another major player. 
The joint venture is targetting $1 billion in revenues for 2022, while Entain - which along with MGM is investing $660 million in the partnership this year - expects it to be in 20 U.S. states over the next 12 months.
""Staid UK high street bookmakers are not an obvious fit for a U.S. fantasy sports giant, but it's Entain's U.S. sports betting venture with MGM that's drawn DraftKings eye""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said.
""Entain not only has the necessary know-how, but also the brand and market position to give it the best chance of success."" 
London-listed companies have been pioneers in gambling technology, developing apps that allow fans to place ""in play"" bets while they watch a match live. 
Entain, whose previous boss Shay Segev left after it snubbed MGM's $11 billion approach, has been on its own buying spree too, snapping up European operators Bet.pt and Enlabs AB. 

The company, which has a database of 160 million players and saw more than 2 million sports bets placed on its platforms a day last year https://entaingroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Entain-2020-Annual-Report.pdf, has been investing in technology. 
For example, it is using behavioural indicators to help identify gamblers at risk of addiction or financial hardship.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and startup Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Materials said on Wednesday they are partnering to form a ""closed loop"" or circular supply chain for electric vehicle batteries, from raw materials to recycling.
The aim is to lower the cost of EVs by reducing the dependence on imported materials, while also narrowing the environmental impact from mining and refining of battery materials.
Ford and Redwood will work closely with Korean battery maker SK Innovation, which has a joint venture with Ford called BlueOvalSK to make EV battery cells in the United States, Ford executive Lisa Drake said at a media briefing.
The issue
Redwood, which was founded in 2017 by former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc executive J.B. Straubel, has been recycling battery scrap and materials at facilities in Nevada. 
In mid-September, the company said it would expand its business to include refining those materials into battery components, including cathodes and anodes, with the aim of supplying enough of those components to equip a million electric vehicles after 2025.
In July, Redwood raised $700 million from investors, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Baillie Gifford. On Wednesday, Straubel said Ford had invested $50 million. Redwood currently is valued at $3.7 billion by investor website PitchBook.
Redwood has partnerships with battery makers Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) in Nevada and Envision AESC in Tennessee, as well as Amazon.
The issue of battery life-cycle management has taken on increasing importance in the plans of both vehicle and battery manufacturers.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) President Mark Reuss, at a conference on Tuesday, said recycling and reuse of EV battery materials is a crucial issue for the auto industry as it ramps up production of electric vehicles.
""There's a lot of material in a battery cell that can be reused,"" he said. ""We're spending time on that.""

GM and battery partner LG Energy Solution in May announced a partnership with startup Li-Cycle to recycle battery scrap material from Ultium Cells, the GM-LGES joint venture that is building battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.
Straubel said Redwood aims to begin recycling some material from Ford this year, with the goal of supplying the first anode material in 2023-2024 and the first cathode material at mid-decade.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities are investigating whether JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) played a role in an alleged bribery and money laundering scheme that dated back to 2011 and involved state-run oil company Petrobras, according to documents reviewed by Reuters and two law enforcement sources. So far, police have focused their attention on purchases of roughly 300,000 barrels of Petrobras fuel oil by JPMorgan in 2011 according to the court documents and sources, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. 
The documents, which were seen by Reuters, include email messages among alleged co-conspirators, witness testimony and bank records. The authorities are working to determine if the alleged bribery continued in subsequent years, the sources added. The court documents viewed by Reuters include witness testimony from a former Petrobras fuel trader named Rodrigo Berkowitz. In his plea bargain agreement with Brazilian authorities, he refers to two fuel cargoes that were sold to a JPMorgan unit. The probe, which is in preliminary stages, is part of a larger investigation https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-brazil-probes-us-oil-trader-freepoint-alleged-bribery-scheme-2021-06-02 by Brazilian authorities who have been examining wrongdoing across the commodity trading industry for years. As one of the world's largest banks, JPMorgan would represent the biggest target yet in the investigation. The country's federal police are working to determine if JPMorgan secured shipments of Petrobras fuel at artificially low prices by routing bribe payments to employees on Petrobras’ trading desk though a network of middlemen, according to the people and documents that relate to the investigation. Brazil's federal police and JPMorgan declined to comment on the investigation. The attorney for Rodrigo Berkowitz did not respond to requests for comment. He has previously confirmed that his client is cooperating with U.S. and Brazilian authorities investigating the commodity trading industry. Petrobras, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said in an email it has ""zero tolerance in relation to fraud and corruption."" The company added that it has aided Brazilian authorities extensively with various corruption-related probes. The world's largest commodity traders, including Switzerland’s Vitol, the world’s top independent oil trader, are also facing scrutiny globally https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-corruption-traders-factbox-idUSKBN28E2RJ after years of investigations into whether they offered bribes to win contracts in several countries in Latin America. Vitol admitted wrongdoing as part of a 2020 settlement with U.S. and Brazilian authorities and has said that is pleased the matter has been resolved. No charges have been brought in the JPMorgan probe, and it remains unclear whether any will be. Elements of the JPMorgan investigation were outlined in previously unreported documents that Brazilian police submitted this year to a federal judge overseeing the probe, including bank records, e-mails and WhatsApp messages exchanged among alleged co-conspirators, which were reviewed by Reuters. The documents also included internal Petrobras files and testimony from a former Petrobras fuel trader. INCREASED SCRUTINY Petrobras, the world's seventh-largest oil producer, routinely buys and sells petroleum products in deals meant to seek the best price possible for the firm. However, U.S. and Brazilian authorities have alleged that some Petrobras traders took bribes from counterparties for more than a decade through 2018. In return, these traders allegedly purchased fuel at inflated prices or sold it at a discount. In December, Vitol agreed to pay $164 million https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-courtcase-idCNL1N2IJ1UL and admit guilt to resolve allegations by U.S. and Brazilian authorities that it paid bribes in Brazil and other Latin American countries between 2005 and 2020. In November, Brazilian prosecutors filed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-trafigura-idUSKBN28A376 a civil lawsuit against Trafigura, alleging the Geneva-based trader and at least two subsidiaries paid Petrobras employees more than $1.5 million in bribes in 2012 and 2013. Trafigura has consistently denied the allegations leveled by Brazilian authorities and has said that outside counsel it hired “found no basis to conclude that Trafigura’s current management were involved in, or had knowledge of, alleged improper payments to Petrobras.” Reuters reported in recent months, citing law enforcement sources and Brazilian court documents, that U.S. and Brazilian authorities are also probing https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-commodity-trader-freepoint-faces-us-bribery-probe-sources-say-2021-07-23 Connecticut-based trading house Freepoint Commodities for its dealings in Brazil from roughly 2012 to 2018. A Freepoint spokesperson wrote in an email at the time that the company “is strongly committed to following the laws everywhere we do business.” The company declined further comment. Brazilian investigators have not yet shared their findings regarding JPMorgan with U.S. authorities, the sources added, though they are likely to do so if the probe advances. Among the matters Brazilian authorities are trying to determine is the timeline of the alleged JPMorgan bribery operation. JPMorgan largely exited physical commodity trading in 2014, selling its operations https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-mercuria-idINBREA2I0LG20140319 to Swiss trader Mercuria for $3.5 billion in an all-cash deal. It is not clear if the alleged bribery occurred up to that date or if the alleged wrongdoing was limited to deals executed in 2011.

Last year, the bank agreed to pay https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idINKBN26K325more than $920 million and admit wrongdoing to settle U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities.
In 2013, shortly before the sale of its physical commodities unit, the bank agreed to pay https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-ferc-idUSBRE96T0NA20130730$410 million to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California and the Midwest.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Battery power may be the frontrunner to become the car technology of the future, but don't rule out the underdog hydrogen.
That's the view of some major automakers, including BMW and Audi, which are developing hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicle prototypes alongside their fleets of battery cars as part of preparations to abandon fossil fuels.
They are hedging their bets, calculating that a change in political winds could shift the balance towards hydrogen in an industry shaped by early-mover Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s decision to take the battery-powered road to clean cars.
Global auto hub Germany is in sharp focus. It is already betting billions on hydrogen fuel in sectors like steel and chemicals to meet climate targets, and closely-fought elections this month could see the Greens enter the coalition government and further push the technology.
BMW is hydrogen's biggest proponent among Germany's carmakers, charting a path to a mass-market model around 2030. The company also has one eye on shifting hydrogen policies in Europe and in China, the world's largest car market.
The Munich-based premium player has developed a hydrogen prototype car based on its X5 SUV, in a project already partly funded by the German government. 
Jürgen Guldner, the BMW vice president who heads up the hydrogen fuel-cell car programme, told Reuters the carmaker would build a test fleet of close to 100 cars in 2022.
""Whether this (technology) is driven by politics or demand, we will be ready with a product,"" he said, adding that his team is already working to develop the next generation vehicles.
""We're on the verge of getting there and we're really convinced we'll see a breakthrough in this decade,"" he said.
VW's premium Audi brand told Reuters it had assembled a team of more than 100 mechanics and engineers who were researching hydrogen fuel cells on behalf of the whole Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group, and had built a few prototype cars.
HYDROGEN TOO COSTLY NOW
Hydrogen is viewed as a sure bet by the world's biggest truckmakers, such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) unit Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck, Volvo Trucks and Hyundai, because batteries are too heavy for long-distance commercial vehicles.
Yet fuel cell technology - where hydrogen passes through a catalyst, producing electricity - is for now too costly for mass-market consumer cars. Cells are complex and contain expensive materials, and although refuelling is quicker than battery recharging, infrastructure is more scarce.
The fact that hydrogen is so far behind in the race to the affordable market also means even some champions of the technology, like Germany's Greens, favour prioritising battery-powered passenger cars because they see them as the fastest way to reach their main goal of decarbonising transport. 
The Greens do, however, back the use of hydrogen fuel for ships and planes and want to invest heavily in ""green"" hydrogen produced solely from renewable sources.
""Hydrogen will play a highly important role in the transport industry,"" said Stefan Gelbhaar, the party's transport policy spokesperson in the Bundestag.
Politics can be unpredictable though - diesel went from saint to sinner following Volkswagen's Dieselgate emissions-cheating scandal, which came to light in 2015. Some carmakers view hydrogen technology as an insurance policy as the EU targets an effective ban on fossil-fuel cars from 2035.
Last year Daimler said it would wind down production of the Mercedes-Benz GLC F-CELL, a hydrogen fuel-cell SUV, but a source familiar with company plans said the project could easily be revived if the European Commission or a German government with Green participation decide to promote hydrogen cars.
""We're focusing on (battery) electric first, but we're in close cooperation with our truck guys,"" said Jörg Burzer, Daimler's head of production, when asked about that approach. 
""The technology is always available.""
180 KPH IN HYDROGEN X5
For years Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Honda, and South Korea's Hyundai, were alone in developing and pushing hydrogen fuel-cell cars, but now they have company.
China is expanding its hydrogen fuelling infrastructure, with several carmakers now working on fuel-cell cars, including Great Wall Motor, which plans to develop hydrogen-powered SUVs.
The EU wants to build more hydrogen fuelling stations for commercial vehicles. Fitch Solutions auto analyst Joshua Cobb said the bloc was only likely to start pushing hydrogen passengers cars in two to three years' time, given it was still figuring out how to pay for its battery-electric car push and how to obtain enough ""green"" hydrogen from renewable sources. 
But he added: ""It's not out of bounds to think if the (German) Greens come into power they could accelerate the push to adopt regulations favouring hydrogen fuel-cell cars.""
BMW's Guldner acknowledged hydrogen technology was too expensive to be viable for the consumer market today, but said costs would come down as trucking companies invested in the technology to bring fuel-cell vehicles to market at scale. 
To demonstrate BMW's hydrogen X5 prototype, Guldner took Reuters for a spin at 180 km (112 miles) per hour on the autobahn near the carmaker's Munich headquarters and in a few minutes gave it enough fuel to run 500 km using a hydrogen gas pump at a Total petrol station. 
Guldner said BMW saw hydrogen fuel-cell cars as ""complementary"" to its future battery electric model range, providing an alternative for customers who cannot charge at home, want to travel far and refuel swiftly. The motor in the hydrogen X5 is the same as BMW's all-electric iX.
""When the future is zero emissions, we believe having two answers is better than one,"" he added. 
A LONG AND WINDING ROAD
Yet Fitch Solutions' Cobb said that it would still take years before any European policy support for hydrogen-powered cars translated into significant sales. 
Indeed, auto consultancy LMC forecasts that various uses of hydrogen - in commercial vehicles, aviation and energy storage - would spur its adoption in passenger cars, but over the longer term. 
""We're just not going to get there any time soon,"" said LMC senior powertrain analyst Sam Adham. LMC estimates in 2030 hydrogen fuel-cell models will make up just 0.1% of sales in Europe, and sales will only take off after 2035.
There remain divisions about the technology's prospects in the global car industry, and even within auto groups.
VW's Audi unit might be researching fuel cells, for example, but Volkswagen group CEO Herbert Diess has been scathing about hydrogen-powered cars.
""The hydrogen car has proven NOT to be the solution to climate change,"" he said in a tweet this year. ""Sham debates are a waste of time.""
Stephan Herbst, general manager of Toyota in Europe, has a different view.

Speaking in his role as a member of the Hydrogen Council business group, which forecasts that hydrogen will power more than 400 million cars by 2050, Herbst said he was confident that now governments had set ambitious carbon-reduction targets, they would push hydrogen alongside battery electric cars.
""We strongly believe this is not a question of either or,"" he added. ""We need both technologies.""

517,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>","U.S. farmers face supply shortages, higher costs after Hurricane Ida","By P.J. Huffstutter and Mark Weinraub
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Troy Walker's phone will not stop ringing at his Kansas farm cooperative, with growers needing fertilizer for their wheat fields in the coming months.
In Kentucky, corn and soybean farmer Caleb Ragland said shelves at his local farm supplier are often bare of weed killer glyphosate and other crop chemicals. He expects the situation could get worse.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s glyphosate manufacturing plant in Louisiana remains shut after Hurricane Ida slammed the Gulf Coast in late August, further complicating logistical and supply chain problems that had already tightened global supplies of fertilizers and chemicals.
""Ida was like a heavyweight boxer going 15 rounds, and threw a hard upper-cut at the farmer,"" said Ragland, a ninth generation corn and soybean farmer in Magnolia, Kentucky. ""Things were already bad. Ida made it worse.""
Ida disrupted grain and soybean shipments from the Gulf Coast, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. exports, at a time global crop supplies are tight and demand from China is strong. 
Now, the storm's ripple effects are hampering production and movement of some fertilizers and crop chemicals ahead of U.S. harvest. This is straining an agricultural and food supply chain already battered by trade and logistics delays during the pandemic.
Rising input costs threaten the incomes of farmers who had banked on booming profits this year, as crop prices soared to the highest in nearly a decade, after years of stagnating around break-even levels. Ragland and other farmers have been rethinking what they will plant in the spring; crops requiring less fertilizer look more attractive.
""At the current prices for nitrogen, it's making me take a hard look at my corn acres,"" Ragland said. ""It makes me think we might grow soybeans on some of those acres.""
Before Hurricane Ida, the U.S. Agriculture Department had estimated that farmers would face a 2.2% increase in all corn input expenses for every acre planted in 2022, according to the most recent data, as chemicals and fertilizers followed higher crop prices and supply chain disruptions.
Global supplies were thin of the raw ingredients needed to make farm herbicides including glufosinate, atrazine and glyphosate, partly due to pandemic-related labor and shipping issues, said Marc-Andre Fortin, director of North American crop protection with Farmers Business Network, an online marketplace for farmers.
Imports of glyphosate containers shipped into the Port of New Orleans were down 71% from the same period a year earlier and herbicide container imports were down 1.2%, according to Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence. Potash imports into New Orleans dropped 14.8%.
Then, Ida hit and shuttered Bayer's glyphosate plant in Luling, Louisiana. The plant helps provide all the active ingredient for Bayer's Roundup branded ag herbicides in the United States, the company told Reuters.
Bayer's plant has been closed since Aug. 28. The company, which hopes to restore power within weeks, said it is also working to repair wind damage and run system tests. 
RATIONING SUPPLIES
Global glyphosate supplies were already tight as flooding, COVID-19 outbreaks and congested ports snarled production and exports in China for months, said Allan W. Gray, executive director of the Purdue University Center for Food and Agricultural Business.
As a result, chemical manufacturers are rationing supplies to farmers and others, Gray said.
Fertilizer is problematic, too. Walker and the staff at Kansas farm cooperative MKC have not been able to get price quotes from fertilizer suppliers for early 2022. Suppliers do not know if they will have anything to sell, he said - so Walker has turned away some customers.
Such problems have plagued retailers for months. China, the world's top exporter of phosphate, temporarily halted urea and diammonium phosphate fertilizer exports this summer to feed domestic demand as energy costs and corn prices rose.
More recently, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) halted operations at two United Kingdom manufacturing complexes, citing high costs for natural gas feedstock, a key raw material used in nitrogen fertilizers.
Canada's largest potash producer  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd is sold out in North America through at least the third quarter, and global stocks for potash are tight for the rest of the year, said Ken Seitz, executive vice president of potash at Nutrien Ltd.
Ida tightened fertilizer supplies further, when CF Industries and Incitec Pivot Ltd shut plants because of the hurricane and declared force majeure for customers.
As the supply chain snarled, prices spiked. Prior to the storm, a New Orleans barge of urea set to ship in September to destinations across the U.S. or Canada traded at $450 a ton, said Josh Linville, director of fertilizer at StoneX Group Inc. After, the price jumped to $552 a ton.
""In the fertilizer world, anything that can go wrong, will go wrong,"" Linville said. ""It's death by a thousand cuts.""

Wheat and cotton farmer Keeff Felty, 54, said the situation is spiraling. He is studying soil samples to see where he can cut back on fertilizer next season, and paid a company to haul some in-state after local suppliers could not fill his order.
""The price went up from Monday to Wednesday,"" said Felty, ""and by that night, they were out.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, with investors eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 180 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 50 points, or 0.4%.
The Fed concludes its latest two-day gathering later Wednesday, and is set to release a statement at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT) along with its new economic forecasts and expected path of interest rate movements.
Investors are also looking for details about when exactly the central bank plans to begin tapering its bond buying, information that will likely guide market sentiment for the next month or so.
“As a base case, we expect the Fed to formally announce a tapering of its asset purchases in November, with the first reduction in purchases starting in December,” said Bill Diviney, senior economist at ABN Amro, in a note.
Sentiment has been boosted ahead of this announcement Wednesday by China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) stating it would make a coupon payment on a domestic bond, offering a measure of relief to investors worried about the giant property developer defaulting.
In corporate news,  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Blackberry (TSX:BB) will report quarterly earnings Wednesday, while the focus will also be on FedEx (NYSE:FDX) after the delivery company reported disappointing first-quarter earnings, citing supply chain issues and a labor crunch.
 Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) will also be in the spotlight after the online personal styling service reported strong quarterly earnings, while sports betting operator DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) raised its offer for U.K.-based Entain to over $16 billion.
Crude prices pushed higher Wednesday as industry data pointed to a sharp drop in U.S. oil stocks last week in the wake of the two recent hurricanes that hit the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
The American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stockpiles fell just over 6 million barrels last week, a much bigger decline than the 2.4 million barrel drop  expected. 
That would be a seventh straight weekly decrease if data from the Energy Information Administration later Wednesday confirms it, and indicative of lingering supply disruptions.

Investing.com – FedEx stock (NYSE:FDX) fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as supply chain issues and labor crunch pulled down the company’s earnings and sales below estimates.
The company’s decision to lower its forecasts added to the disappointment, while the reiteration of a hike in shipping rates effective January 3 did nothing to counter that.
FedEx Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick W. Smith said a constrained labor market reduced the availability of personnel and resulted in network inefficiencies. This led to higher wages and increased transportation expenses. All these raised costs by $450 million, eating into profits.
Higher package and freight yields offset the cost inflation a little. Exports rose too.
The prior year’s results included a pre-tax benefit of approximately $65 million, which was not repeated this year.
Companies worldwide have struggled with labor shortages as demand has boomed and supply chains have remained disrupted due to Covid-19 restrictions and lack of raw material inputs.
FedEx said it will raise shipping rates 5.9%-7.9%. Effective this November 1, and also raise its fuel surcharge.
The company’s first quarter revenue came in at $19.3 billion, around 12% lower than a year earlier. Diluted earnings per share were $4.37, compared to $4.87 last time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's banking regulator will take a role in overseeing computer systems at Mizuho Financial Group's retail banking arm after glitches that exposed failings at the country's third-largest lender despite $3.6 billion in upgrades.
The Financial Services Agency's unusual move reflects the deep regulatory concern over deep-rooted technical problems at Mizuho Bank, which the FSA ordered to improve its business.
""I can't think of any other cases where the FSA has become so closely involved in inspections of a (banks') computer system,"" said Brian Waterhouse, senior bank analyst of Windamee Research, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform.
""This shows how much the FSA is concerned about the problems,"" Waterhouse added.
The FSA will communicate with Mizuho Bank on the running of its computers, officials said at a briefing, although the regulator stopped short of taking on direct management of the bank's systems after a series of technical meltdowns this year.
These included widespread ATM outages, causing frustration among customers and undermining confidence in Mizuho Bank.
""Mizuho will submit reports with what's needed to be done to us and we will point out if changes are needed."" an FSA official told a media briefing, adding that there would be ongoing conversations with the bank. 
The problems are all the more notable given that Mizuho spent more than $3.6 billion to overhaul its systems in 2019 following two large-scale breakdowns in 2002 and 2011. 
A third-party report commissioned by the bank found its corporate culture was to blame for its tech system failures, creating an atmosphere where managers are reluctant to express opinions and unable to respond well to crises.
Mizuho said in a statement it took the regulator's punishment seriously and reassess the need for scheduled system upgrades and updates.
""Our top priority is the stable operation of our IT system, and we will do all in our power to ensure upgrades and updates proceed steadily and securely,"" it said.

""All of our employees will continue to work together towards this goal.""
The regulator's next actions will depend on the outcome of a report from the bank, which is due by Oct. 29.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Delhi wants to block Chinese investors from buying shares in Indian insurance giant Life Insurance Corp (LIC) which is due to go public, four senior government officials and a banker told Reuters, underscoring tensions between the two nations.
State-owned LIC is considered a strategic asset, commanding more than 60% of India's life insurance market with assets of more than $500 billion. While the government is planning to allow foreign investors to participate in what is likely to be the country's biggest-ever IPO worth a potential $12.2 billion, it is leery of Chinese ownership, the sources said.
Political tensions between the countries rocketed last year after their soldiers clashed on the disputed Himalayan border and since then, India has sought to limit Chinese investment in sensitive companies and sectors, banned a raft of Chinese mobile apps and subjected imports of Chinese goods to extra scrutiny.
""With China after the border clashes it cannot be business as usual. The trust deficit has significantly widen(ed),"" said one of the government officials, adding that Chinese investment in companies like LIC could pose risks.
The sources declined to be identified as discussions on how Chinese investment might be blocked are ongoing and as no final decisions have been made.
India's finance ministry and LIC did not respond to Reuters emailed requests for comment. China's foreign ministry and commerce ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Aiming to solve budget constraints, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is hoping to raise 900 billion rupees through selling 5% to 10% of LIC this financial year which ends in March. The government has yet to decide on whether it will sell one tranche of shares seeking to raise the full amount or choose to seek the funds in two tranches, sources have said.
Under current law, no overseas investors can invest in LIC but the government is considering allowing foreign institutional investors to buy up to 20% of LIC's offering.
Options to prevent Chinese investment in LIC include amending the current law on foreign direct investment with a clause that relates to LIC or creating a new law specific to LIC, two of the government officials said.
They added that the government was conscious of the difficulty in checking on Chinese investments that could come indirectly and would attempt to craft a policy that would protect India's security but not deter overseas investors.
A third option being explored is barring Chinese investors from becoming cornerstone investors in the IPO, said one government official and the banker, although that would not prevent Chinese investors from buying shares in the secondary market.

Ten investment banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and SBI Capital Market have been chosen to handle the offering.

Investing.com – DraftKings stock (NASDAQ:DKNG) traded 0.8% lower in Wednesday’s premarket on worries that its pursuit of U.K.-based Entain (LON:ENT) will prove bad value for shareholders.
The stock had closed 7.4% lower Tuesday after Entain rejected its first offer as too low. DraftKings sweetened the offer on Sunday.
DraftKings has now offered 2,800 pence per Entain share consisting of 630 pence in cash and the balance payable in new DraftKings shares. The latest offer is a premium of 46.2% to Entain's closing share price on September 20 and amounts to over 16 billion pounds ($22 billion) more than four times the company’s 2020 revenue.
Entain said it is studying the latest offer and that DraftKings must announce a firm intention to buy not later than 5 PM on October 19 or say it does not intend to do so.
It said the deadline will only be extended with the consent of the U.K.’s Takeover Panel.
Entain is one of the world’s largest sports-betting and gaming groups, operating both online and in the retail sector. It has licenses in 27 countries and employs a workforce of more than 24,000.
In the U.S., the Group operates BetMGM, a joint-venture with MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM).

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, helped by M&A action in the leisure sector and an easing of tensions around embattled Chinese property group  Evergrande , ahead of a key Federal Reserve meeting.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7%.
Concerns that China Evergrande Group (HK:3333), the country’s second largest property developer, will default on a debt pile that accounts for over 10% of all Asian high-yield debt have recently pressured equity markets around the globe.
Some of these worries were lifted Wednesday after Evergrande's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, said it would make a bond interest payment on Thursday after private negotiations with bondholders.
This news doesn’t end the speculation of default, with Evergrande having an $83.5 million interest payment due on Thursday and a second $47.5 million interest payment due next week, but it boosted confidence of avoiding widespread market disorder.
In Europe it was the travel and leisure sector leading the way, with Entain (LON:ENT) stock jumping 7.4% to a new all-time high after the U.K.-based gambling firm revealed a $22 billion takeover proposal from U.S.-based DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG).
UBS Group (SIX:UBSG) and HSBC (LON:HSBA) also posted gains Wednesday despite data from Morningstar showing these investment banks, along with fund giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), were among the largest buyers of Evergrande debt.
Elsewhere, the Munich-based Ifo institute cut its forecast for German growth this year to 2.5% from 3.3%, reflecting the impact of Delta-variant Covid-19 and supply chain disruptions for local industry. However, it raised its estimate for growth next year to 5.1% from 4.3%.
That said, the day’s main highlight will be the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, with investors looking to see whether the U.S. central bank clears the way for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year.
Crude prices pushed higher Wednesday as industry data pointed to a sharp drop in U.S. oil stocks last week. The American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stockpiles fell just over 6 million barrels last week, a much bigger decline than the 2.4 million barrels expected.

By Aftab Ahmed and Nupur Anand
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering allowing foreign institutional investors to buy up to 20% of state-owned Life Insurance Corporation's initial public offering, a government source said on Wednesday. 
The listing of LIC is set to be India's biggest ever initial public offering, with the government aiming to raise up to 900 billion rupees ($12.2 billion) from its stake sale.
At present, even though foreign institutional investors are allowed to hold up to 74% of private insurance companies and up to 20% of state-owned banks, they are not permitted to own shares in LIC.
Enabling this would allow foreign pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds to participate in the IPO of India's largest life insurer.
The government is keen to complete the listing this financial year to help with budgetary constraints and late last month selected 10 merchant banks out of the sixteen that had bid to kick-start the process.
In total, the merchant banks will earn a fee of around 100 million rupees ($1.36 million), higher than the token fee charged on some IPOs of state-owned firms in the past, but still significantly lower than fees for private listings. 
For instance, food delivery startup Zomato paid $31 million in fees for listing earlier this year, according to Dealogic.
The low fee, however, has not been a deterrent, with nearly all the major banks barring  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) queuing up.

""We can’t care less about what is the money that is being offered. It is the biggest IPO in recent times and will be probably the biggest, say for another 5 years,"" said a merchant banker.

LONDON (Reuters) - A review of how Britain's listed companies spell out their chances of surviving found assessments had too little detail to properly inform investors, the auditing watchdog said on Wednesday.
""Clear and comprehensive disclosures on these matters are particularly important given the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic which caused greater uncertainty for some companies,"" the Financial Reporting Council said in a statement.
Many companies had to borrow money from government schemes introduced to bridge the pandemic and some industries such as travel and hospitality have been badly hit by lockdown restrictions.
""Uncertainties that impact viability or going concern should be clearly explained to stakeholders,"" the FRC said.
In their annual reports, companies typically set out how they expect to remain viable for up to three years and whether there are any ""material uncertainties"", such as potential difficulty in meeting debt repayments.
The watchdog reviewed a selection of annual reports with financial years ending between December 2020 and March 2021.
The FRC said assumptions made to underpin going concern disclosures often lacked sufficient detail to back up judgements.
The FRC, which also polices how companies apply Britain's corporate governance code of best practice, said firms should seek to extend the period over which they assess their viability and provide longer term information where possible.

Company reporting and auditing is facing widespread reform after corporate collapses at British retailer BHS and builder Carillion raised questions about the quality of auditing.
Britain has proposed that companies publish a ""resilience statement"" covering viability for five years ahead, instead of the three-year period most commonly used now for going concern assessments.

The pay of the billionaire chief executive has been challenged by a labour union over the company's decision to cancel a bonus programme while giving him an option award instead, only to then re-instate the bonus.
Proxy advisers have given a split verdict on Smith's pay, with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) giving ""cautionary support"" while Glass Lewis recommended that owners vote it down because of the reversal of the initial arrangement.

The shareholder vote on Sept. 27 is advisory and not binding on FedEx.

The litigation had sought recovery of alleged losses by PokerStars players in Kentucky from 2006 and 2011. Flutter and the Stars Group said it had relied on a centuries-old statute that was intended to allow individuals who incurred gaming losses to bring an action against their opponents.

Relief is at hand for markets on Wednesday, after China's Evergrande said it would make a domestic bond coupon payment.
U.S. stock futures, the yuan and the risk-sensitive Australian dollar are riding high, while the safe-haven yen and U.S. Treasuries are on the back foot.
Don't get too comfortable -- even if Evergrande makes its Sept. 23 onshore bond payment, it has not indicated whether it can pay $83.5 million in interest due on its March 2022 bond on Thursday. Nor is there any sign the Chinese government plans to mount a last-minute rescue.
And with the U.S. Federal Reserve set to conclude its two-day meeting later on Wednesday, perhaps this week's market excitement is not over yet.
After all gas prices are at lofty levels, threatening to hurt consumption, which means central banks meeting across the globe this week are likely to be challenged on the message that inflation is transitory.
For the Fed, weaker-than-anticipated jobs numbers have already dampened expectations it will announce an imminent start to tapering bond-buying stimulus.
It might however clear the way for tapering later this year and show in updated projections whether higher-than-expected inflation or a resurgent coronavirus pandemic is weighing more on the economic outlook.
The Bank of Japan just kept monetary policy steady but offered a bleaker view on exports and output, reinforcing expectations it won't join peers mulling a withdrawal of crisis-mode support.
Elsewhere, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday to fund the U.S. government through Dec. 3 and suspend a borrowing limit until end-2022. Senate Republicans however have vowed to block it.

Investing.com -- U.K. betting group Entain (LON:ENT) said it's considering an improved offer of 2,800 pence a share from U.S. group DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), after rejecting a first bid of 2,500p as too low. 
The new offer is a hybrid cash-and-stock offering, consisting of 630p in cash and the rest in Draftkings shares. The total offer values Entain at 46% more than its closing price on Monday. Entain stock rose 18% on Tuesday after news of the first offer, closing at 2,261p. 
Entain said it will study the new bid closely and recommended shareholders take no action at the present time. 
The move is the latest deal in a red-hot sector that had seen a flurry of deal-making in recent years.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","Facebook wraps up deals with Australian media firms, TV broadcaster SBS excluded","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Facebook Inc has told Australian publishers it has stopped negotiating licensing deals, an email to the industry seen by Reuters showed, a move which came just six months after the passing of a law designed to make tech giants pay for news content.
While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has announced deals with most of the country's largest news outlets, some companies including TV broadcaster SBS and smaller publishers have been left out in the cold, raising questions about the scope and effectiveness of the ground-breaking law.
Australia is the only country with a law where the government may set the fees if negotiations between tech giants and news providers fail, but the rejected companies are left with little recourse for the time being and are waiting for the government to review the law in 2022 as planned. 
Facebook's regional head of news partnerships, Andrew Hunter, said in an August email to publishers it had ""now concluded"" deals where it would pay Australian companies for content on its just-launched ""Facebook News"" channel. 
Nick Shelton, founder of Broadsheet Media, a website which publishes entertainment news, reviews and listings and was rebuffed by Facebook, said the decision to close off on new deals was ""clearly an attempt from Facebook to cap their exposure to independent publishers.""
The Special Broadcasting Service, or SBS, one of Australia's five national free-to-air broadcasters and the country's main source of foreign language news, said Facebook declined to enter negotiations despite months of attempts and that it was surprised and disappointed. It noted it had successfully concluded a deal with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
""This outcome is at odds with the Government's intention of supporting public interest journalism, and in particular including the public service broadcasters in the Code framework with respect to remuneration,"" an SBS spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
Hunter said in the email to publishers, which has not been made public, that rejected publishers would continue to benefit from clicks directed from Facebook and recommended they tap a new series of industry grants.
In a separate statement to Reuters, Hunter said content deals were ""just one of the ways that Facebook provides support to publishers, and we've been having ongoing discussions with publishers about the types of news content that can best deliver value for publishers and for Facebook"".
Facebook did not respond directly to questions about the statements from Broadsheet Media and SBS.
The U.S. social media giant has inked deals with a range of large Australian big media companies including News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and the Australian Broadcasting Corp and has a collective bargaining arrangement with rural publishers. But only a handful of independent and smaller publishers have reached deals.
Other rejected publishers include the Conversation https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-rejects-talks-with-australia-publisher-testing-worlds-2021-06-25, which publishes public affairs commentary by academics, Reuters has previously reported. That prompted a rebuke from the regulator which drafted the law. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission declined to comment on Wednesday.
Under the law, which drove Facebook to block third-party content on newsfeeds briefly in the country in February, Facebook and Google must negotiate with news outlets for content that drives traffic to their websites or face possible government intervention.
But before there can be any government intervention, the federal treasurer must determine that either Facebook or Google failed to negotiate in good faith, a step known as ""designation"". A representative for Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was not immediately available for comment.

Facebook's rejection of SBS and the Conversation flies in the face of law's core proposition that it ""should be required to compensate public interest journalism"", said Peter Lewis, director of the Centre for Responsible Technology, a think tank.
""The treasurer has no alternative but to revisit designating Facebook to ensure that it meets its commitments to public interest journalism in Australia.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, helped by an easing of tensions surrounding embattled Chinese property group  Evergrande , ahead of a key Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Asian stocks have been battered of late, dragging their European equivalents lower, on concerns that China Evergrande Group (HK:3333), the country’s second largest property developer, will default on a debt pile that accounts for over 10% of all Asian high-yield debt.
Some of these worries were lifted Wednesday after China Evergrande Group's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, said it would make a bond interest payment on Thursday after private negotiations with bondholders.
This news doesn’t end the speculation of default, with Evergrande having an $83.5 million interest payment due on Thursday and a second $47.5 million interest payment due next week, but it boosted the market’s confidence of avoiding widespread market disorder.
The day’s main highlight will be the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, with investors looking to see whether the U.S. central bank clears the way for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year.
Back in Europe, the economic data highlight will be the flash consumer confidence release for the Eurozone in September, which is expected to show a small fall.
In corporate news, UBS (SIX:UBSG) and HSBC (LON:HSBA) will be in the spotlight after data from Morningstar showed these investment banks, along with fund giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), were among the largest buyers of Evergrande debt. 
Crude prices pushed higher Wednesday as industry data pointed to a sharp drop in U.S. oil stocks last week in the wake of the two recent hurricanes impacting the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
The American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude stockpiles fell just over 6 million barrels last week, a much bigger decline than the 2.4 million barrel drop  expected. 
That would be a seventh straight weekly decrease if data from the Energy Information Administration later Wednesday confirms it, and indicative of lingering supply disruptions. 
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $71.53 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.3% to $75.35. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,779.55/oz, while EUR/USD edged lower to 1.1721.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican used-car platform Kavak said it has more than doubled its valuation to $8.7 billion based on its latest funding round, making it the second-most valuable startup in Latin America as it eyes further expansion beyond its home market.
Kavak's chief executive, Carlos Garcia, told Reuters the Mexico City-based firm netted $700 million in its Series E round, making the platform second only to Brazilian fintech Nubank among the highest-valued startups in the region. (https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/buffett-backed-nubank-seek-ipo-valuation-over-554-bln-sources-2021-08-25)
The injection of capital has delivered a boost to Kavak's plans to expand outside the region as a one-stop shop for browsing, purchasing and financing pre-owned cars via an app. 
Kavak said funding was led by U.S. venture capital firm General Catalyst, while SoftBank Group Corp, billionaire Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Singapore-based gaming and e-commerce company Sea Ltd, Tiger Global, Spruce House, hedge fund D1 and Ribbit Capital also participated.
The new funding round is the latest sign of an aggressive push into Latin America's startup scene by Japan's SoftBank, which last week launched https://www.reuters.com/business/softbank-renews-bet-latin-america-with-3-bln-fund-2021-09-14 a $3 billion fund to invest in the region's technology companies. 
Founded nearly five years ago in Mexico, Kavak expanded to Argentina in 2020, before landing in Brazil this year, which it described as its largest market.
The company will most likely focus next on expanding to emerging markets beyond Latin America, CEO Garcia told Reuters, noting that announcements could come within six months.
""We're looking outside the region for our next step,"" he said in an interview. ""We want to go into the biggest, most broken market where we can really make a dent, where we can really make users' lives better, so we're not agnostic to Latin America."" 
Kavak previously said it had doubled its valuation to $4 billion (https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/mexican-used-car-startup-kavak-hits-4-billion-valuation-2021-04-07) just months ago after an earlier investment round.
Since then, Garcia said, the company has grown rapidly as more consumers became eager for an alternative to peer-to-peer car buying which can be unreliable or financially risky.
Demand only increased during the coronavirus pandemic as public transportation shuttered and more people turned to pre-owned cars. Kavak says it now has 5,000 employees across Latin America. Just over a year ago, the firm had only 300.
A severe semiconductor shortage that slammed the brakes on the global auto industry, first felt in the United States, was also starting to creep in to Mexico's car market, Garcia said.
""In the U.S., you're seeing a shortage of products in the new and used car industry. We're starting to see this early trend in Latin America, we think it's going to be a huge driver for Kavak in the next few months,"" Garcia said. 
Kavak has drawn inspiration from Chinese companies like ride-hailing group Didi Global Inc as it looks to expand what Garcia called the ""super app experience,"" offering multiple services through a single app.

Chinese consumer habits closely resemble those in Latin America, Garcia said. 
""The composition of the people there, how they live, it's more similar to Latam than the composition of how people live in the U.S.,"" Garcia said. ""It's easier for us to think about logistics, how to get to users.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday urged U.S. passenger airlines ""to commit to take more action"" to address reports of violent or unruly passengers.
The agency said it had asked airline trade groups at a meeting on Tuesday to disclose within a week what steps they will take to curb such incidents. The FAA said the industry is facing a record number of airline passenger disturbances, and it plans to soon hold similar meetings with representatives from airports and labor.
The meeting with groups, including Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and others, discussed ""ways the industry can work together to reduce the number of unruly passenger incidents,"" the FAA said, adding it ""believes additional action by the airlines and all aviation stakeholders is necessary to stop the unsafe behavior."" 
On Monday, two senior U.S. Senate Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday to prosecute unruly air passengers.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin and Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said ""civil penalties alone are failing to deter criminal activity by airline passengers.""
In June, Airlines for America and aviation unions also asked Garland to prosecute disruptive and violent air passengers.
To date this year, there have been 4,385 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,199 that were mask-related. The FAA has initiated enforcement actions in 162 cases, issuing more than $1 million in proposed fines.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson imposed in January a zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on flights around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That policy will extend until at least as long as federal mask rules on airplanes are in place, which were extended last month into mid-January 2022.
Separately, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday on unruly passengers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday removed $1 billion in military funding for Israel from legislation to fund the U.S. government after objections from liberals in the House of Representatives, but party leaders pledged to bring the matter up again later this week.
Some House Democrats objected to a provision in a stopgap spending bill to provide the additional funding so Israel can replenish its ""Iron Dome"" missile-defense system. The U.S. company Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp produces many Iron Dome components.
The House is debating legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-vote-tuesday-fund-govt-through-dec-3-raise-debt-limit-2021-09-21 to fund the federal government through Dec. 3 and raise the nation's borrowing limit. 
The dispute forced the House Rules Committee to adjourn briefly before leaders of the Appropriations Committee pledged that funding for the Israeli system would be included in a defense spending bill later this year. That could set the stage for another dispute over military aid for Israel.
On Tuesday evening, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he would bring a bill to the House floor later this week that would fully fund the missile-defense system, and he expected it to pass. ""We ought to do it ... it is absolutely essential,"" Hoyer said. 
Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman, one of the Democrats who had concerns about the provision, said earlier that House members had not been given enough time to consider the matter.
""The problem is leadership (will) just throw something on our table, give us about five minutes to decide what we're going to do and then tries to move forward with it,"" Bowman told reporters.
The United States has already provided more than $1.6 billion for Israel to develop and build the Iron Dome system, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report last year. The funding reflects perennially strong support for aid to Israel among both Democrats and Republicans.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement that the removal of the funding was ""a technical postponement"" and he had been assured by U.S. Democratic leaders that funds for Iron Dome would be transferred soon. 
Some liberal Democrats objected to U.S.-Israel policy this year, citing the many Palestinian casualties after Israel struck back following Hamas rocket attacks in May. Israel said most of the 4,350 rockets fired from Gaza during the conflict were blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.

The Senate Banking Committee tied 12-12 on Chopra's nomination to the CFPB in March, but Schumer on Tuesday ""discharged"" Chopra from the committee, meaning his nomination can be put to a full floor vote.
Earlier on Tuesday, Schumer praised Chopra as having a long history of defending middle-class people from financial institutions and students from for-profit colleges.
Chopra's departure from the Federal Trade Commission, to which he was unanimously confirmed in 2018, would leave the five-member body with two Democrats and two Republicans. Three members of the commission must support a proposal for it to go forward. Privacy advocate Alvaro Bedoya has been nominated to replace him.
Progressives see both financial regulators as key to advancing policy directives around climate change and racial justice. The CFPB has been a political lightning rod since it was created following the 2009 financial crisis, beloved by Democrats as a guardian of ordinary Americans but reviled by Republicans as too powerful and unaccountable.
Chopra is expected to stamp out exorbitant lending rates and abusive debt-collection practices and address the student debt burden and gaps in minorities' access to credit.

""Americans need someone at the helm of the CFPB who is ready to stand up to the biggest banks and the most powerful corporations in order to protect consumers,"" Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday evening.
""Rohit Chopra has the expertise and track record to lead an agency dedicated to protecting working families and all consumers.""

Gensler's remarks follow a jittery trading day for Wall Street on Monday due in part to investor fears of contagion from a potential collapse of Chinese property giant China Evergrande Group.
""I do think we are in a better position in 2021 to absorb some of those shocks than we were prior to the '08 crisis,"" Gensler told the Washington Post during a livestreamed interview, citing reforms adopted following the decade-ago financial crisis to bolster the financial system.

The share of job postings advertising signing bonuses on Indeed UK rose 75% to 0.51% in the three months ending August 31, especially for gas engineers, pharmacists, drivers and social careers. 
The share of nursing roles with signing bonuses remained high, with some listings offering up to 5,000 pounds ($6,821.00), according to the survey.
Acute labour shortages due to the pandemic, which forced many overseas workers to return home, and Brexit, which has restricted access to EU workers, could last a couple of years, according to some estimates. 
In recent months, recruiters for white-collar roles have flagged wage inflation as companies are forced to pay higher salaries to woo talent.
Employers focusing on one-off financial incentives like bonuses for signing on, rather than raising wages, might be betting on current hiring difficulties being temporary, Indeed Hiring Lab economist Jack Kennedy wrote in a note.
A survey in August by Britain's Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said firms planned to increase staff numbers by the most in more than eight years over the coming months as the economy reopens after the end COVID-19 curbs. 

While the share of postings offering joining bonuses remains small overall, it seems likely that signing incentives, which in many cases run to several thousand pounds, will remain a notable feature of the recruitment landscape in the near term, Kennedy added.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 08:20PM ET</span>",Vanguard says it supported more environmental and social resolutions,"By Ross Kerber
(Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc said on Tuesday it supported environmental and socially focused shareholder resolutions 20% of the time this year, up from 6% in 2020, as climate change and diversity matters drew more focus at corporate annual meetings.
The trend was in line with how other top managers worldwide voted in the springtime proxy season, increasing pressure on companies to disclose more about their carbon emissions or the demographics of their workforces.
In a report sent by a spokeswoman, the top U.S. mutual fund firm outlined several new case studies describing how it cast critical votes this year including at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and at  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX)
At Berkshire, a little over a quarter of votes cast were in favor of two shareholder resolutions, effectively a rebuke for management.
Vanguard said it supported one calling for the company to review its diversity efforts after ""our research found that the company lacked public disclosures about its diversity measures, goals or progress."" 
Vanguard also said its funds voted in support of a call for Berkshire to outline how it manages climate risks and opportunities, ""to address a material risk.""
Berkshire representatives did not immediately respond to questions.

In another high-profile contest, Vanguard said it voted in favor of a proposal for Chevron to cut emissions, saying it allowed for sufficient flexibility in how the company would implement the request and helping the proposal receive majority support. But Vanguard said it did not support two other shareholder resolutions tied to climate matters.
Asked about Vanguard's report, a Chevron spokesman referred to recent comments from Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth that the company plans to update its climate report later this year and that ""you can expect to see in that report a response to shareholder votes from this year's annual meeting.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's move to launch new funds to support startups will help companies seeking IPOs, though it could take years before Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) might become a centre for regional tech listings, according to market players.
Despite shaping up as one of Asia's leading finance hubs, Singapore has seen a decline in listings over the past decade and failed to attract large initial public offerings.
Market participants say, though, that the setting up of two funds with S$2 billion ($1.5 billion) in capital for firms' late-stage fundraising and IPOs, coupled with blank-check companies being allowed to list in the city-state, will attract more startups to list there.
""The value proposition by the Singapore eco-system to founders and shareholders of high-growth businesses is that it will be a part of the company's journey - before, during and after the IPO,"" said Ho Cheun Hon, head of Southeast Asia equity capital markets at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""This should resonate with some founders and entrepreneurs, particularly the unicorns who are starting to think about public listings.""
The city-state has a long way to go.
So far this year, up to September 16, just three companies have listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX), raising $239 million, according to data from Refinitiv. The amount raised is less than half the figure from the same period last year and the lowest level in six years.
By comparison, funds raised on the Malaysian bourse stands at $531 million, the Indonesian and Philippines exchanges have each attracted $2.3 billion, while the Thai bourse has topped $3.5 billion.
As Southeast Asian tech dealmaking booms, Singapore is looking to attract more attention after some major companies chose to list elsewhere in recent years.
Singapore-based gaming and e-commerce firm Sea listed in the United States in 2017, for example, and is now valued at $182 billion. Southeast Asian ridehailing and delivery firm Grab is also listing in the United States, via a blank-check firm, while gaming firm Razer debuted in Hong Kong in 2017.
Vinnie Lauria, a founding partner at Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures, welcomed the government's attempts to foster startup success.
""This is another example of Singapore using capital and smart government programs to promote itself as the hub for Southeast Asia startups.""

Robson Lee, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, said the Singapore market has the potential to ""punch above its light weight by being better organised and coordinated to attract unicorns and high technology global corporates"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended near flat on Tuesday after a broad sell-off the day before, with worries over troubles at developer China Evergrande and caution ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy news keeping a lid on the market.
Trading was choppy, with the Dow and S&P 500 erasing session gains just before the close, while the Nasdaq finished slightly higher. 
Shares of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co fell 4.2% and were the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Dow after Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek said the resurgence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus was delaying production of some of its titles.
Concerns over China Evergrande Group have put investors on edge and added to recent worries over economic growth from the Delta variant.
Persistent default fears overshadowed efforts by Evergrande's chairman to boost confidence in the firm on Tuesday, while Beijing showed no signs it would intervene to stem any effects across the global economy.
""People have been preconditioned to buy pullbacks for most of the last year plus,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""But that overhead nervousness is still there,"" he said. ""The Evergrande situation is still a black cloud hanging over global markets. Combine that with uncertainty with Fed commentary coming tomorrow, and there's a reluctance to get overly aggressive on the long side.""
Investors are waiting for the end of this week's Fed meeting that may shed light on when its massive purchase of government debt will begin to ease.
Officials will reveal new projections as investors also are on alert for any timing on rate tightening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.63 points, or 0.15%, to 33,919.84, the S&P 500 lost 3.54 points, or 0.08%, to 4,354.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 32.50 points, or 0.22%, to 14,746.40.
S&P 500 industrials led losses among sectors.
Adding to late-day bearishness, shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp fell after records in Boston federal court showed the United States and several U.S. states on Tuesday filed an antitrust lawsuit against the companies. American Airlines ended down 2.8% while JetBlue fell 4.8%.
The S&P 500 index traded below its 50-day moving average, its first major breach in more than six months. The average has served as a floor for the index this year.
Analysts say a breach of the index's 200-day moving average may now be in sight. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 98 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.73 billion shares, compared with the 9.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 08:07PM ET</span>","With Gucci bags and Dyson appliances, Evergrande wooed retail investors","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Lured by the promise of yields approaching 12%, gifts such as Dyson air purifiers and Gucci bags, and the guarantee of China's top-selling developer, tens of thousands of investors bought wealth management products through China Evergrande Group. 
    Now, many fear they may never get their investments back after the cash-strapped property developer recently stopped repaying some investors and set off global alarm bells over its massive debt. 
Some have been protesting at Evergrande offices, refusing to accept the company's plan to provide payment with discounted apartments, offices, stores and parking units, which it began to implement on Saturday.
    ""I bought from the property managers after seeing the ad in the elevator, as I trusted Evergrande for being a Fortune Global 500 company,” said the owner of an Evergrande property in the conglomerate's home province of Guangdong surnamed Du.  
    ""It's immoral of Evergrande not to pay my hard-earned money back,"" said the investor, who had put 650,000 yuan ($100,533) into Evergrande wealth management products (WMPs) last year at an interest rate of more than 7%. 
    More than 80,000 people – including employees, their families and friends as well as owners of Evergrande properties - bought WMPs that raised more than 100 billion yuan in the past five years, said a sales manager of Evergrande Wealth, launched in 2016 as a peer-to-peer (P2) online lending platform that originally was used to fund its property projects.  
    Some 40 billion yuan of the investments are outstanding, said the person, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak with the media.
China Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, which was a public holiday in China.
With more than $300 billion in debt, Evergrande's liquidity crisis rattled global markets this week. The company has vowed to repay WMP investors.
CHRISTMAS PROMOTION
China's years-long effort to deleverage its economy has pushed companies to resort to off-balance sheet investments in search of funding.
After Beijing further capped debt levels of property developers last year, the most indebted players like Evergrande felt even more pressure to find new sources of capital to ease mounting liquidity stress, turning to employees, suppliers and clients for cash through commercial paper, trust and wealth management products.
Evergrande Wealth started to sell WMPs to individuals in 2019 after a regulatory crackdown led to a collapse of the P2P lending sector, said the sales manager and another Evergrande employee who bought the WMPs. 
    To attract investors, the sales manager offered gifts such as Dyson air purifiers and Gucci handbags to each person who bought more than 3 million yuan of WMPs during a Christmas promotion last year.
A product leaflet provided by the sales manager seen by Reuters showed the WMPs are categorised as fixed-income products suitable for ""conservative investors seeking steady returns"". 
'DE-FACTO EVERGRANDE PRODUCT'
In two products sold last November, a construction company in Qingdao was looking to raise up to 10 million yuan with annualised yield of 7% in one and 20 million yuan with yields ranging from 7.8% to 9.5%, depending on the investment size, in another. Minimum investments were 100,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan, respectively. 
    Evergrande also usually offers additional yield up to 1.8% to certain investors, which can push returns to above 11% for a 12-month investment, said the sales manager.  
    Proceeds were to be used for Qingdao Lvye International Construction Co's working capital, the documents showed. The firm could not be reached for comment during a public holiday.
Repayment would either come from the issuer's income or from Evergrande Internet Information Service (Shenzhen) Co, a subsidiary that runs Evergrande Wealth and promises to cover the principal and interest if an issuer fails to repay, the prospectus said.
    The sales manager said the Qingdao company was working on Evergrande projects and would use the payment from Evergrande upon completion to repay investors. 
    “It's a de-facto Evergrande product,"" the person said.
Other highly leveraged Chinese conglomerates including HNA Group, which declared bankruptcy early this year, and China Baoneng have used similar products. 
In a petition to various government bodies, a group of WMP investors in Guangdong accused Evergrande of inappropriately using money that should have gone to the issuers to fund its own projects, and not sufficiently disclosing the risks.
    They also complained that they were misled by the stature of its chairman, Hui Ka-yan, noting that he was seated prominently during a 2019 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. 

    ""The investors trusted Evergrande and bought Evergrande's WMPs out of our love for and faith in the Party and government,"" they wrote.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>","U.S. sues to stop American Airlines, JetBlue partnership","By Diane Bartz, David Shepardson and Jonathan Stempel
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department and six states filed an antitrust lawsuit on Tuesday against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp seeking to stop a partnership the government said could lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports.
The lawsuit asked a federal court in Boston to stop the ""Northeast Alliance"" partnership, announced in July 2020 and approved by the U.S. Transportation Department shortly before the end of the Trump administration. It took aim at American Airlines, the largest airline in the world, saying the alliance would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. 
""Fewer flights. More expensive tickets. Lower quality service,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta whose state was one of those that joined in the suit. ""Plain and simple: American Airlines and JetBlue's Northeast Alliance is anticompetitive.""
Shares of both airlines closed lower and both vowed to fight the suit, which struck a serious blow to a deal that could help both companies profit at a time when the pandemic has sunk sales and the outlook for air travel remains murky. 
JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes maintained the alliance has actually led to lower fares for the northeastern United States and said the airlines compete vigorously elsewhere.
""DOJ presided over an unprecedented amount of consolidation to create four large airlines,"" Hayes said, noting that blowing up the alliance would mean JetBlue loses access to slots held by American. If the government wins, ""JetBlue is the biggest loser there and they are returning all of those slots and all of that power back to (American).""
The suit also signals the Biden administration's interest in trying to inject more competition where American and three other airlines control 80% of the domestic air market.
The Justice Department said the sweeping alliance would create a de facto merger in the northeast and combine the two carriers operations at four major airports: Boston Logan, John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. 
The agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs in a move aimed at giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the Northeast.
Shares of American Airlines closed down 2.8% at $19.76 while JetBlue was down 4.8% at $14.76.
States joining the lawsuit include Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, the court records show. 
The Justice Department complaint said the partnership at least partially removed JetBlue as a disruptive maverick that would work to drive down prices. 
""JetBlue’s reputation for lowering fares is so well known in the airline industry that it has earned a name: the 'JetBlue Effect',"" it said.
Elsewhere, the government said American was ""not satisfied with the consolidation that has made it the largest airline in the world"" and was trying ""to co-opt JetBlue.""

The complaint said American chief executive Doug Parker ""has cheered ... successive waves of industry consolidation. When he was not cheering them, he led them. He served as CEO of America West when it merged with US Airways. Later, he served as CEO of US Airways when it merged with American. Internally, American has referred to Mr. Parker as the 'Godfather of consolidation.'""
Parker said in a statement the lawsuit ""seeks to take away consumer choice and inhibit competition, not encourage it. This is not a merger: American and JetBlue are – and will remain – independent airlines.""

555,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:56PM ET</span>",Explainer: Why investigators are still probing Takata air bag inflators,"By David Shepardson and Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Why are U.S. auto safety regulators opening a new investigation into Takata air bag inflators installed in millions of vehicles built over the past 20 years?
Some of those vehicles have the original inflators that were installed when they were manufactured and some have inflators installed as replacements in vehicles previously recalled. In certain situations, mainly long exposure to extreme heat and humidity, those inflators can unexpectedly rupture, sending metal shrapnel through the vehicle cabin, with the potential to cause injuries and deaths.
What is an ""inflator""?
An air bag inflator is a small explosive device designed to ignite in a split second in a vehicle crash, then rapidly fill a large cushion with inert gas to help shield and protect occupants from serious injury.
A family-run Japanese company called Takata, now controlled by China’s Joyson Electronic Corp, started supplying air bags to auto companies around the world in the late 1980s.
Takata inflators made since the late 1990s use a powerful chemical, ammonium nitrate, as a propellant. When that chemical is exposed over long periods to moisture and heat, it tends to break down and become volatile and potentially explosive.
When did Takata know?
Takata learned of the first inflator rupture in 2003. Some of the company’s managers learned of additional inflator ruptures after that. Some test report data was altered by Takata employees to hide this from Takata’s automaker customers.
The first Takata-related recall - of 4,000 Honda Accords and Civics - was announced in 2008. Over the next five years, Honda Motor Co,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co, Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp and BMW AG recalled nearly 4 million U.S. vehicles for inflator ruptures, a total that grew to more than 10 million by 2014 and eventually 67 million in 2016.
Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan in 2017.
Over the last decade, more than 100 million vehicles with Takata air bag inflators have been recalled worldwide. Of the U.S. recalls, about 50 million have had repairs or replacements.
There have been at least 28 deaths worldwide, including 19 in the United States, and more than 400 injuries tied to faulty Takata inflators.
The latest investigation
To help mitigate issues with ammonium nitrate, Takata in 2015 agreed to start building original-equipment and replacement inflators with a drying agent, called a desiccant, to absorb excess moisture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there have been no reported ruptures in vehicles on the road with air bag inflators with the drying agent.
The agency in September 2021 said it “wants to evaluate the future risk” of inflators made with desiccant and installed in vehicles that have not been recalled.

The new investigation includes vehicles assembled by Honda, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Toyota, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Nissan, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc,  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE), Mazda,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW, Chrysler (now part of Stellantis NV ), Porsche Cars and Jaguar Land Rover (owned by  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM)), among others.
NHTSA said its investigation ""will require extensive information on Takata production processes and surveys of inflators in the field.""

The iShares exchange-traded fund tracking high-yield corporate bonds, which fell 0.35% on Monday, was up about 0.17%.
High-yield bond spreads rose on Monday, after falling last week to their lowest level since July in a sign of a general risk-on mood.
The option-adjusted spread on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. High Yield Index, a commonly used benchmark for the junk bond market, widened to 323 basis points from Friday's 304 basis points in its biggest move since July 19.
The spread refers to the interest rate premium investors demand to hold corporate debt over safer Treasury bonds.
The spread on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index, a benchmark for investment-grade debt, increased only a basis point to 91 basis points on Monday.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:50PM ET</span>",Airbus in talks on sales of A350 freighter -exec,"By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (Pa:AIR) is in talks with several potential customers for a new A350 freighter while seeing signs of demand for smaller A320 passenger jets in Europe, its sales chief said on Tuesday.
With e-commerce booming, Airbus formally began marketing a proposed freight variant of its A350 passenger jet in July, taking aim at Boeing’s tight grip on the global cargo market.
“We are in a number of very encouraging discussions,” Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told reporters in Toulouse, where the European planemaker is based. 
“It is available for sale and is selling,” he added.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has for years dominated the market for purpose-built freighters, even as its European rival grabbed the crown as the world's largest maker of passenger jets.
Boeing is preparing to launch its own new freighter, a cargo version of its upcoming 777X jetliner, industry sources say.
Freighters can sell for higher prices than passenger planes and help to prop up depressed production for wide-body models at a time when long-haul travel is weak, industry experts say.
While demand for wide-body passenger jets remains stagnant, demand for smaller planes used in regional and domestic markets is rising.
""Demand is coming back,"" Scherer said. ""We need to be very careful - we are not out of the woods and we are still in a very fragile environment - but Europe is rallying quite nicely at this moment.""
Airbus plans to increase production of the medium-haul A320neo family, which competes with Boeing's 737 MAX, to a record 63 a month from 40 now, surpassing pre-crisis levels.
It has said it is also looking at pushing output as high as 75 a month, but such levels have drawn concerns about supply chains from engine makers like France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Scherer defended the existing production commitments, which he said were justified by contracts with airlines even after an industry shakeout brought about by the coronavirusus crisis.
""If anything in my world I am challenging them to be steeper,"" he said.
Airbus is talking to Hungary's Wizz Air over a sale of at least 100 more narrowbody jets, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Among other European prospects, British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) has reopened a fresh competition between Airbus and Boeing for narrowbody jets, revisiting a large provisional order for 200 MAX jets that was never finalised, the sources said.

Finnair is looking at a narrowbody purchase but a formal tender has yet to be launched.
Air France-KLM in July said it had launched a tender to extend the medium-haul fleets of Dutch unit KLM and the French and Dutch arms of low-cost subsidiary Transavia.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>","FedEx labor shortfall hits quarterly profit, earnings forecast","By Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) posted a 7% drop in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast on Tuesday, after labor shortages crimped earnings, slowed packages and drove up costs ahead of the all-important holiday peak season. 
Shares in the Memphis, Tennessee-based company fell 4.6% to $240.50 in extended trading after FedEx said staffing problems resulted in a $450 million year-over-year increase in costs due to higher wage rates and overtime, increased spending on third-party transportation services and shipping hiccups.
""The impact of constrained labor markets remains the biggest issue facing our business"" and was a key driver for the first-quarter underperformance, FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said on a conference call with analysts. 
Most of the excess labor expense hit the company's Ground network - which is now rerouting 600,000 packages a day, or 6.4% of the segment's average daily volume during the quarter - to work around woes stemming from the labor shortfall, executives said. 
As an example, Subramaniam said its hub in Portland, Oregon, is just 65% staffed. That requires FedEx to pay more and send packages to other hubs - adding time, package miles and spending on outside help. 
""We anticipate the cost pressures from network inefficiencies, such as the one I just illustrated, to persist through peak,"" Subramaniam said. ""Overcoming staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority."" 
FedEx said adjusted net income fell to $1.19 billion, or $4.37 per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $1.28 billion, or $4.87 per share, a year earlier. 
Revenue increased 14% to $22.0 billion. 
On the heels of the report, FedEx lowered its full-year forecast for earnings, excluding items, to $19.75 to $21.00 per share. FedEx previously forecast 2022 earnings per share, excluding items, of $20.50 to $21.50. 
FedEx and competitor  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) are sprinting to hire holiday help as the resurgence of Delta variant-driven COVID-19 infections threatens to increase e-commerce delivery demand during the holiday season, when package volume can easily double. 
FedEx aims to bring on 90,000 holiday workers. It hired 70,000 last year and 55,000 in 2019.
Up-and-coming rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is touting average pay of $18 per hour as it races to expand its own delivery network. Amazon's nonunion delivery contractors compete with FedEx and its Ground delivery partners for workers. 

UPS workers are unionized and among the highest paid in the industry. Shares in UPS shed 2.6% after the FedEx report. 
At the market close on Tuesday, shares in FedEx were down 10% over the past six months, while UPS shares gained 19%.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:11PM ET</span>","Pret to serve suburbs, stations and motorways in shift from skyscrapers","By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Coffee and sandwich chain Pret A Manger plans to double in size over the next five years, replacing a previous UK focus on offices with expansion in regional and suburban areas, transport hubs and motorway service stations.
Urban fast food outlets were hit hard during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting some to re-think their growth strategies.
Pret, owned by investment group JAB and founder Sinclair Beecham, said on Wednesday it plans to open more than 200 UK shops in the next two years, including 100 franchise shops.
It also intends to enter five new markets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia by the end of 2023 and invest in new digital capabilities.
Pret, as it is commonly known, currently runs 550 shops across five markets, the UK, U.S., France, Dubai and Hong Kong.
Majority owner JAB and Beecham will invest a further 100 million pounds ($137 million), on top of the 185 million pounds they ploughed in to get Pret through COVID.
Pret closed stores and shed jobs during the crisis as revenue slid 58% to 299 million pounds in 2020 and the group recorded an operating loss of 256.5 million pounds.
Many of its UK stores are located close to offices, which were badly hit when people started working from home.
SKYSCRAPER SHIFT
Pret said its recovery plan shifts from ""following the skyscraper"" to serving more people across the UK and overseas.
""Pret has just under 400 stores in the UK and a lot of our national competitors have 2,000-2,500, so we see that there's huge runway for us to grow the brand,"" Pret CEO Pano Christou told Reuters.
""We are just broadening our approach to growth,"" he said.
Pret said that over the last month its trading had gathered pace, with regional shops performing at their strongest levels.
The group's workforce has grown 28% since the start of 2021. It now employs nearly 8,000 globally, including 6,400 in the UK, and is aiming to hire a further 3,000 by the end of 2023.
To help it survive the pandemic, Pret has transformed its operating model and last year launched a subscription service for drinks.
The service was added to the U.S. last week and launches in other markets are planned over the next few months, Christou said.

Pret is also selling coffee lines through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Ocado (LON:OCDO), has delivery partnerships with Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and is also trialling shops within Tesco stores.

While this has left the markets oversold short-term, it has not done much to help valuations for most tech stocks, with the Nasdaq-100 still up more than 120% off the March 2020 lows and some leading tech stocks easily doubling this performance. The good news is that while the market itself remains expensive, as do many QQQ constituents, there are a few names trading at reasonable prices when factoring in their industry-leading growth rates. Two of these names are Paycom Software (PAYC) and Amazon.com (AMZN), with Paycom recently breaking out of a large base and Amazon currently pulling back after a failed breakout earlier this year. While neither is cheap at current levels, they are names worth paying a close eye on if this market correction continues. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
Paycom Software and Amazon have little in common. One is a large-cap Enterprise-Software company. The other is a mega-cap Internet-Retail company with a cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services. However, two traits that each company shares are market leadership with a wide moat, and incredible compound annual earnings per share growth rates. In PAYC’s case, the company has grown earnings at an astounding compound annual rate of ~64% since FY2014. In AMZN’s case, earnings have grown at 101% compound over the past five years (FY2015). While these growth rates can not persist forever, both companies are expecting to double annual EPS again between FY2020 and FY2023, suggesting that their respective growth stories are far from over. This makes them attractive buy-the-dip candidates, especially since they’ve underperformed some of their peers over the past year, so they are nowhere near as extended from a technical basis.

NEW YORK/LONDON(Reuters) - World stock markets stabilized on Tuesday and oil prices regained ground a day after heavy selling of risk assets, as investors assessed the level of contagion stemming from distress at developer China Evergrande and awaited central bank meetings. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS edged up 0.13%, following Monday's biggest percentage drop in two months. Wall Street's main indexes ended mixed after solid equity advances in Europe. 
Price moves in bonds and currencies were relatively subdued. On Monday, safe-haven assets drew bids as investors became risk averse. Gold pushed higher again on Tuesday, in a sign of investor caution. 
Investors were focused on the situation at Evergrande, where persistent default fears eclipsed efforts by the debt-laden group's chairman to lift confidence as Beijing showed no sign it would intervene to stem any domino effects across the global economy. 
There are ""some investors willing to step back in after a pretty big whack yesterday,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

(Reuters) -British gambling firm Entain said on Tuesday that U.S. fantasy sports betting company DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) had made a takeover proposal that valued it at $22.4 billion.
Under its current proposal, DraftKings plans to offer 28 pounds per Entain share, representing a premium of 46.2% to the UK firm's Monday close. Entain said it had earlier rejected a proposal from DraftKings to buy the company for 25 pounds ($34.15) per share.
Entain's shares closed up 18% as the companies confirmed the approach, which would give the U.S. firm access to the  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) Poker and bwin online betting brands. Shares of DraftKings were down 0.6% in extended trading after closing 7.4% lower at $52.77.
DraftKings' takeover proposal comes after Entain had rejected an $11 billion offer from U.S.-based MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International in January, saying it undervalued the company, but analysts expect MGM to return with a new bid as it has since accumulated more cash.
Entain and MGM already have a joint venture called BetMGM, an online sportsbook for betting on NFL and NBA games that controls about 21% of the market versus DraftKings' 17%, according to RBC Capital Markets.
Any deal in which Entain would own a competing business in the United States would require MGM's consent, MGM said on Tuesday in response to DraftKings' approach.
The deal frenzy in the online gambling space comes at a time when regional operators are looking to expand and capture opportunities in states across the United States opening up to sports betting.
In a transatlantic deal, Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment acquired Britain's William Hill, a traditional rival to Entain's Ladbrokes brand, in a 2.9 billion pound transaction earlier this year. Caesars is selling the non-U.S. assets of William Hill.
Demand for online betting boomed during the pandemic as customers took to playing from home when casinos and betting shops were off-limits.
DraftKings, which allows users to enter daily and weekly fantasy sports-related contests, confirmed it had approached Entain but did not provide any additional details. It bought rival Golden Nugget Online Gaming Inc in a $1.56 billion all-stock deal last month.

Entain said DraftKings had until Oct. 19 to make a firm offer for the company.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in Deerfield, Ill., and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) in Camp Hill, Pa., are popular drug stores in the United States. WBA is a pharmacy-led health and wellbeing company that operates through three segments—Retail Pharmacy USA; Retail Pharmacy International; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. As of August 31, 2020, WBA operated 9,021 retail stores under the Walgreens and Duane Reade brands and six specialty pharmacies. RAD operates a retail drugstore chain, selling prescription drugs, nonprescription medications, health and beauty aids, household items, pet care, and other every day and convenience products. It also offers drug benefits under the federal government's Medicare Part D program and insurance offerings. As of April 28, 2021, the company operated approximately 2,500 retail pharmacy locations in 17 states.
Because the resurgence of COVID-19 cases has led to increased demand for testing and medicines, pharmacy companies are witnessing rising sales.

The department store chain's push to hire more workers comes during a major labor crunch in the United States that has spurred retailers to raise wages to attract workers during the crucial end-of-year shopping period. 
Earlier this month, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said it planned to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division ahead of the holiday season, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.
Seasonal hiring plans of retailers also often indicate their sales expectations for the holidays. Macy's (NYSE:M) last month raised its full-year sales forecast as it benefits from shoppers splurging on perfumes, shoes and dresses as they return to post-lockdown social events. 
Last year, Macy's had cut seasonal hires to 25,000 as the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on its business. The company had hired 80,000 workers in 2019.

Macy's said about 48,000 of the new roles this year were specifically for the holiday season, while the remaining were for permanent positions beyond the holidays. About 21,200 roles are for the its fulfillment centers.

(Reuters) - Changes to the main U.S. flood insurance program will raise rates for 77% of policyholders, according to a new study issued on Tuesday, although property owners in some poorer neighborhoods will see premiums decrease.
The study by the QuoteWizard unit of financial services provider LendingTree Inc reviewed price changes due for the roughly 5 million participants in the National Flood Insurance Program, set up in 1968.
Under the new ""Risk Rating 2.0"" system from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) taking effect Oct. 1, new premiums will be based on a property's value, risk of flooding and other factors, rather than simply on a home's elevation.
Meant to account for climate-change-driven shifts like increasing flood frequency, the new plans also will make the program more equitable, said Nick VinZant, QuoteWizard senior research analyst.
""Now the smaller, lower-value homes and neighborhoods aren't going to be funding the mansions anymore,"" VinZant said in an interview.
With the weather impact of climate change worsening, flooding losses are expected to rise. Recent storms including Hurricane Ida have caused massive flooding from Louisiana and Tennessee to New York City. 
FEMA had said it aimed to ""equitably distribute premiums across all policyholders"" with the changes. Of the roughly 5 million policyholders in the program, 3.3 million will see monthly payments rise up to $10, and 3,199 will see an increase of $100 or more per month, VinZant said. Meanwhile 196,000 people will see their monthly premiums fall $100 or more, he added.

FEMA representatives did not immediately comment on the study. As of April, its flood insurance program provided $1.3 trillion in coverage but has been losing money.
The proposed changes have drawn concerns in the U.S. Congress including from representatives from Louisiana and Texas, who have asked FEMA to delay the new rates to avoid higher bills for some policyholders.

GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said last week GM expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for chip suppliers, but warned third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles due to the shortage.
Looking ahead, Reuss said a crucial issue for the auto industry would be recycling materials used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, such as rare earth minerals.
""There's a lot of material in a battery cell that can be reused,"" he said. ""We're spending time on that.""

GM in July said it was investing in a U.S. lithium project that could become the country's largest by 2024, making the No. 1 U.S. automaker one of the first to develop its own source of a battery metal needed for EVs. 
Reuss said GM was also looking at opportunities in Australia, without disclosing details.

The board's inquiry follows a Wall Street Journal report last week that Facebook exempts high-profile users from some or all of its rules, raising questions about its enforcement decisions against harmful content.
A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company will brief the board about the system known internally as ""cross-check"" over the coming days.
The cross-check system includes millions of accounts, some of which are ""whitelisted,"" meaning they are immune from Facebook's enforcement decisions, the Journal reported.

The Oversight Board said Tuesday it previously asked Facebook to explain how the cross-check system works and share its criteria for adding pages and accounts to the program. The board said Facebook did not provide its criteria.
Facebook created the Oversight Board last year as part of an effort to address criticism over how it handles problematic content. The social media company committed $130 million in a trust to fund the board, which is able to make final decisions on whether individual pieces of content can remain on the site.

Investing.com - FedEx (NYSE:FDX) Tuesday trimmed its full-year outlook and first-quarter profit that fell short expectations as higher labor costs weighed on performance.
FedEx shares lost 2.13% in after-hours trade following the report.
FedEx announced earnings per share of $4.37 on revenue of $22.00 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $21.9 billion.
""First quarter operating results were negatively affected by an estimated $450 million year over year increase in costs due to a constrained labor market which impacted labor availability, resulting in network inefficiencies, higher wage rates, and increased purchased transportation expenses,"" the company said.
Looking ahead, the company reduced its earnings outlook to reflect first quarter results, which were lower than the company’s June forecast.
""As conditions during the first quarter were more challenging than anticipated and are now expected to extend longer, the revised FedEx outlook also reflects management’s updated expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year,"" the company said.
Expectations for earnings per diluted share were trimmed to between $18.25 to $19.50 before the MTM retirement plan accounting adjustments, compared to the prior forecast of $18.90 to $19.90 per diluted share.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Tuesday, as an intraday rebound faded amid slowing global growth worries and difficulties in China ahead of the Federal Reserve monetary policy decision due Wednesday.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.15%, or 50 points, the Nasdaq added 0.2%.
Cyclical sectors including energy and consumer discretionary recovered some losses from Monday’s rout, but gains were kept in check by concerns about a potential economic crisis in China, and the wider implications for global growth, as beleaguered real estate giant Evergrande is unlikely to receive a government bail out.
“We believe Beijing would only be compelled to step in if there is a far-reaching contagion causing multiple major developers to fail and posing systemic risks to the economy,” the rating agency said in a note dated Sept 20.
EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) led the energy sector higher. ConocoPhillips receive an added boost after Shell (LON:RDSa) said it would sell its Permian Basin assets to the company for $9.5 billion in cash.
Health care stocks were also above the flatline as most vaccine stocks climbed following reports that Washington will mandate that all teachers and school staff must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by Nov. 1.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) ended lower, while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) rose 1%, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was up 2%. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) pared some gains despite releasing positive vaccine results showing that a second dose of its coronavirus vaccine boosts protection for moderate-to-severe Covid-19 to 94%.
Tech struggled to join in the broader market rebound as investors appeared wary of dip-buying in tech following a selloff a day earlier.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), were mostly flat.  
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) jumped nearly 12% after the ride-sharing company upgraded its forecast, estimating a potential maiden adjusted profit in third quarter.
The company guided third-quarter gross booking to between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion up from a prior forecast of between $22 billion to $24 billion.
The tentative rebound on Wall Street comes just as the Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting.
Ahead of the meeting, the Fed’s plan to trim its $120 billion monthly bond purchase program has dominated investor attention, but some say believe the taper has been priced in.
“I think that tapering is priced into the market at this point,” Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. ""But higher interest rates are going to be problematic for the consumer and for the economy going forward.""
Beyond the taper, however, the central bank’s projections on a first rate hike, currently expected in 2023, could surprise markets.
“If the Fed does signal an earlier rate hike [in 2022], that would be a negative shock to the equity markets, but I don't expect that,” Schuringa added."

580,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 03:41PM ET</span>","General Mills, KB Home, FOMC Statement: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Investors shook off Monday’s volatility and pushed stocks slightly higher for much of the day on Tuesday, seeming to relax about the debt worries at China’s Evergrande that shook the markets earlier. Stocks held onto gains until the very end, when the S&P 500 and Dow dipped into the red, though Nasdaq finished up.
Of course, the Federal Reserve kicks off its policy meeting today and concludes it later on Wednesday, when it will release its decision and Chair Jerome Powell will say a few words to the media. Anticipation has been building for weeks.
Tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq higher and the CBOE Volatility Index index, also called the “fear gauge” on Wall Street, dipped below the four-month high it hit a day earlier.
Evergrande concerns boiled over in yesterday’s session as investors worried that it could become a global contagion in financial markets. The world’s largest economies are trying to recover from the pandemic, and any disruption could unsettle markets.
The Fed is expected to lay the groundwork to ease its massive bond-buying stimulus, though it could put off announcing its plans until future meetings. Though this tapering is widely expected to start in the coming months, the markets are still skittish about the details.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Food earnings
 General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS), the maker of Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt, will report its first-quarter performance on Wednesday. It is expected to clock 89 cents in profit per share on revenue of $4.3 billion.
2. Focus on home builders
Home builders have had an ugly week after D.R. Horton Inc (SA:D1HI34) lowered sales expectations and  Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN)missed on revenue, both citing supply chain issues. After tomorrow’s closing bell, KB Home (NYSE:KBH)is set to report earnings. It is seen posting $1.61 in profit per share on third-quarter revenue of $1.56 billion.
3. The big meeting
The two-day meet of the Federal Open Market Committee concludes Wednesday. The Fed has indicated pulling back on its unprecedented monetary support before the end of the year. The exercise is likely to begin with the central bank first slowing its asset purchases to eventually follow it up with an interest rate hike. Major policy changes are not expected at Wednesday’s announcement by Chairman Jerome Powell, but nonetheless, all eyes are on him.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Massachusetts mayor first elected at age 23 was sentenced on Tuesday to six years in prison after being convicted in May of defrauding investors in a smartphone app company and extorting money from local marijuana businesses.
Former Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia, now 29, said nothing as U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock in Boston ordered him to be incarcerated for engaging in ""reprehensible corruption of a type that is incomprehensibly crude.""
Correia's lawyer, William Fick, argued that his client's youth impeded his ability to know better and urged Woodlock to give him just three years in prison, saying his history ""suggests there is at least hope.""
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zach Hafer argued that Correia's ""old-school corruption"" warranted an 11-year prison term, saying he continued breaking the law even when he knew was under investigation.
""That is the height of chutzpah,"" Hafer said.
Correia was elected in 2015 as the youngest mayor ever of Fall River. His case was featured in ""Run This City,"" a documentary series produced by Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg on the now-defunct streaming site Quibi.
Prosecutors said that before being elected mayor, Correia, a young Providence College graduate, lured investors into sinking $363,690 into SnoOwl, a company developing an app to connect local businesses with consumers.
Prosecutors said Correia stole more than $231,000 to fund his campaign and a lavish lifestyle that included a luxury Mercedes-Benz vehicle, jewelry, casino trips and strip clubs.
Prosecutors also said that after Correia was elected mayor, he extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from marijuana companies seeking licenses to open in Fall River.

A jury found Correia guilty https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/former-massachusetts-mayor-convicted-fraud-extortion-2021-05-14 on 21 charges including wire fraud, filing false tax returns and extortion. The judge this week threw out eight of Correia's wire and tax fraud convictions, finding that prosecutors failed to prove them.
Correia is expected to appeal his conviction on the remaining 13 counts.

Prices of agricultural commodities have risen sharply, a trend contributing to increased first-half profits reported by LDC, but remain well below peaks seen a decade ago, Michael Gelchie said.
""Unlike in 2010-2011, we're likely in store for a period of elevated volatility,"" Gelchie told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Continued waves of COVID-19, shipping congestion and question marks over when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start tapering monetary support were all fuelling volatility, he said.
""We still haven't necessarily seen a normalisation of the supply chain,"" Gelchie said.
A broader surge in commodity and energy prices also reflected a shift towards a low-carbon economy, given that ""the infrastructure to support that costs money,"" he added.
LCD, one of the world's larggest agricultural commodity merchants, earlier on Tuesday announced a sharp rise in first-half profit, supported by higher prices and strong demand for staple crops.
Gelchie declined to comment on the group's prospects for the rest of the year, noting that prices remained high and crush margins for oilseeds strong. 
The improved results further ease financial pressure on LDC after it completed this month the sale of a stake to Abu Dhabi holding firm ADQ, bringing in the first non-family shareholder in the agricultural commodity group's 170-year history.
The deal with ADQ, which allowed LDC's parent company to repay $1 billion borrowed from its operating group, would help LDC accelerate investments, Gelchie said, without giving details.

ADQ has secured four seats on an enlarged nine-member supervisory board headed by main shareholder Margarita Louis-Dreyfus. 
The deal with LDC also involves a plan to supply food commodities to the United Arab Emirates.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Persistent default fears eclipsed efforts by China Evergrande Group's chairman to lift confidence in the embattled firm on Tuesday, as Beijing showed no signs it would intervene to stem any domino effects across the global economy.
Analysts played down the threat of Evergrande's troubles becoming the country's ""Lehman moment,"" though concerns about the spillover risks of a messy collapse of what was once China's top-selling property developer have roiled markets.
In an effort to revive battered confidence in the firm, Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yuan said in a letter to staff the company is confident it will ""walk out of its darkest moment"" and deliver property projects as pledged.
In the letter, coinciding with China's mid-autumn festival, the chairman of the debt-laden property developer, also said Evergrande will fulfil responsibilities to property buyers, investors, partners and financial institutions.
""I firmly believe that with your concerted effort and hard work, Evergrande will walk out of its darkest moment, resume full-scale constructions as soon as possible,"" said Hui, without elaborating how the company could achieve these objectives.
Investors in Evergrande, however, remained on edge.
Its shares fell as much as 7%, having tumbled 10% in the previous day, on fears its $305 billion in debt could trigger widespread losses in China's financial system in the event of a collapse. The stock ended down 0.4%. 
Other property stocks such as Sunac, China's No. 4 developer, and state-backed Greentown China on Tuesday recouped some of their hefty losses in the previous session. The Hong Kong property sector index rose nearly 3%.
""We are uncertain of how far and how strong the ripple effect would be on the housing market and the developer industry,” analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a recent note. “We think investors should remain on the sideline until there is more clarity.”
Fund giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and investment banks HSBC and UBS have been among the largest buyers of Evergrande’s debt, Morningstar data showed.
BlackRock added 31.3 million notes of Evergrande's debt between January and August 2021, while HSBC increased its position by 40% through July, according to Morningstar. UBS increased its position by 25% through May, the latest date available in the fund tracker's database showed.
The Chinese government has been largely quiet on the crisis at Evergrande in recent weeks. 
""There must be negotiations behind the scenes about a systemic recapitalization (of Evergrande) by state proxies,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Hong Kong-based Orient Capital Research.
""If one piece of Evergrande's debt is allowed to default, it would trigger questions about all of their remaining debt from investors and the government doesn't want a wider crisis like that,"" he said.
World stocks stabilised somewhat on Tuesday and oil prices recovered from the previous day's heavy selling, as investors grew more confident that contagion from the distress of Evergrande would be limited. 
Hedge fund managers contacted by Reuters said they were not yet concerned about any contagion risk into other equities markets. 
“From our perspective, we … do not see any potential fundamental long-term effects on our portfolio companies,” said one London-based hedge fund professional. However, “there could likely be a lot of volatility around this one in the short term.”
A default by Evergrande has been widely anticipated by some corners of the market. 
""I would characterize Evergrande as a telegraphed and controlled detonation,"" said Samy Muaddi, the portfolio manager of the $5.1 billion T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund, who does not have a position in the company. ""If an investor was still investing in Evergrande they were investing against Chinese policy makers, which is a good way to lose."" 
However, the spillover concerns at least in the property sector remained. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings downgraded Sinic Holdings to 'CCC+' on Tuesday, citing the Chinese developer's failure ""to communicate a clear repayment plan"".
Hong Kong-listed shares of small-sized Chinese developer Sinic plunged 87% on Monday, wiping $1.5 billion off its market value before trading was suspended.
A major test for Evergrande comes this week, with the firm due to pay $83.5 million in interest relating to its March 2022 bond on Thursday. It has another $47.5 million payment due on Sept. 29 for March 2024 notes. 
Both bonds would default if Evergrande fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates.
""I think (Evergrande's) equity will be wiped out, the debt looks like it is in trouble and the Chinese government is going to break up this company,"" said Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research and one of the world’s best known short-sellers.
""But I don't think that this is going to be the straw that breaks the global economy's back,"" said Left, who in June 2012 published a report that said Evergrande was insolvent and had defrauded investors.
Evergrande missed interest payments due Monday to at least two of its largest bank creditors, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
SPILLOVER RISKS
The Chinese government will help Evergrande at least get some capital, but it may have to sell some stakes to a third party, such as a state-owned enterprise, Dutch bank ING said in a research note.
""The spin-off of non-core businesses, for example, those that are not residential real estate type businesses, will probably be done first,"" wrote Iris Pang, ING's Chief Economist, Greater China.
""After that could come sales of stakes that are at the core of Evergrande's business,"" Pang said. 
Citi analysts in a research note said that regulators may ""buy time to digest"" Evergrande's non-performing loan problem by guiding banks not to withdraw credit and extend the interest payment deadline. 
Still, Citi said that while Evergrande's default crunch was a potential systemic risk to China's financial system, it was not shaping up as ""China's Lehman moment."" 
At the same time, the U.S. market is in a better position to absorb a potential global shock from a major company default compared with the years prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler said on Tuesday. 
In any default scenario, Evergrande, teetering between a messy meltdown, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing, will need to restructure the bonds, but analysts expect a low recovery ratio for investors. 
S&P Global Ratings said in a report on Monday it does not expect Beijing to provide any direct support to Evergrande.

""We believe Beijing would only be compelled to step in if there is a far-reaching contagion causing multiple major developers to fail and posing systemic risks to the economy,"" the rating agency said.
""Evergrande failing alone would unlikely result in such a scenario,"" S&P said.

On Sept. 9, the White House said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing an emergency temporary standard that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated, or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test once a week.
The White House has said those rules will apply to more than 80 million private sector employees.
The Retail Industry Leaders Association and the National Retail Federation strongly encouraged OSHA ""to provide a 90-day implementation timeline to allow retailers and other employers to create the systems necessary.""
The retail groups, which represent companies including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), CVS Best Buy,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), asked how the administration will ensure adequate COVID-19 testing capacity to satisfy the ""significant increase in demand.""

The groups said ""there could be as many as 4 million retail workers who may need to be tested on a weekly basis."" They also asked other detailed questions like ""what remedial actions can be taken in situations in which employees refuse vaccinations and testing?""
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told travel executives last week that the OSHA order is expected in ""a matter of weeks. ... We have been told in October.""

As such, we think EnLink Midstream (NYSE:ENLC), Sharecare (SHCR), SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ:SDC), and Crescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) could be good additions to one’s watchlist now because they gained more than 10% in price last week. Read on.The stock market has been volatile lately due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, rising inflation, and simmering geopolitical tensions. This has caused a downtrend for several mid-cap stocks, which are typically more sensitive to market volatility than large-cap stocks.
However, continuing efforts to increase the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines (including initiatives to administer booster shots) and lower-than-expected inflation data for August have renewed investors’ positivity about a continuing economic recovery. This resulted in a trend reversal for some mid-cap stocks last week.
EnLink Midstream, LLC (ENLC), Sharecare, Inc. (SHCR), SmileDirectClub, Inc. (SDC), and Crescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) gained more than 10% in price last week. So, we think it could be wise to add these stocks to one’s watchlist.

The company, founded in Florence in 2010, will receive 10 million euros ($12 million) of investment to develop its digital platform, launch new planting projects and open subsidiaries in Paris and Amsterdam later this year, it said on Tuesday.
The move comes ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, known as COP26, in November which Italy is co-hosting with the UK. 
The group of investors supporting the company is led by Italian asset manager Banca Generali (MI:GASI), which put 3 million euros into it. Italian merchant bank DRV Capital and Exor will inject 2.7 million and 250,000 euros respectively. 
Rosberg, together with Italy soccer player Giorgio Chiellini, LVMH executive Andrea Guerra and other Italian investors will contribute small sums, the company said.
Rosberg, who retired from racing in 2016 shortly after becoming world champion, has already invested in several start-up companies linked to sustainability including Lilium, which is developing all-electric small jets. 
""When we met to seal the partnership, I told Nico imagine the impact we could have if every person or company in Europe gave a tree as a gift even once a year. This is our shared vision, to make the world greener one tree at a time,"" said Treedom CEO Federico Garcea.
Through the Treedom platform individuals and companies pay to plant a tree in a chosen location and can follow it as it grows. The tree can be virtually gifted to others. 
""It took 9 years to plant the first million trees, it only took a year to plant the second million,"" Garcea said, adding the company plans to open an office in New York next year.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>",J&J says second shot boosts protection for moderate-severe COVID-19 to 94%,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said Tuesday a second shot of its COVID-19 vaccine given about two months after the first increased its effectiveness to 94% in the United States against moderate to severe forms of the disease.
That compares to 70% protection with a single dose.
The data will help J&J make its case to U.S. regulators for a booster shot even as the company stresses the durability of its single-shot vaccine as a tool to ease the global pandemic.
President Joe Biden is pushing for booster shots in the face of surging hospitalizations caused by the Delta variant and J&J, the only drugmaker with a single-shot COVID-19 vaccine approved in the United States, has been under pressure to produce evidence on the effectiveness of an additional dose.
The company has now ""generated evidence that a booster shot further increases protection against COVID-19,"" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, said in a statement.
J&J said a booster given two months after the first dose increased antibody levels four to six-fold. When given six months after the first dose, antibody levels shot up twelve-fold, data released last month showed, suggesting a large improvement in protection with the longer interval between doses.
Side effects with two doses were comparable to those seen in studies with the single-dose vaccine. The data is yet to be peer reviewed but will be submitted for publication in the coming months.
To date, only  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE have submitted sufficient data for U.S. regulators to evaluate whether boosters are warranted ahead of the Biden Administration's Sept. 20 deadline for rolling out booster shots. A decision on that vaccine https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-boosters-pfize/regulators-could-ok-pfizer-boosters-for-older-americans-this-week-idUSKBN2GG0KQ is expected this week. 
On Friday, an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend emergency authorization of additional Pfizer shots for Americans 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness, but voted to recommend against broader approval, saying they want to see more data.
J&J said it has submitted data to the FDA and plans to submit it to other regulators, the World Health Organization and other vaccine advisory groups worldwide to inform their decision-making. 
The Phase III two-dose trial of up to 30,000 participants tested the effectiveness of a second dose given 56 days after the first in adults 18 and older.
While the study found that two doses of the J&J vaccine was 94% effective in the United States at preventing moderate to severe disease, there was only 1 case in the vaccine group and 14 in the placebo group, resulting in a wide confidence interval and raising questions about the certainty of the result.
The study had a short follow-up period of around 36 days, but found that a second dose was well tolerated, the company said. 
The company also said on Tuesday that evidence from a separate real world study of nearly 400,000 people in the United States who got the J&J shot showed the vaccine was 79% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and 81% effective at preventing hospitalizations compared with 1.52 million people of similar ages, genders and health issues who were unvaccinated.

J&J said there was no evidence of reduced effectiveness over the study's duration from March to late July - a period that included the impact of the Delta variant. 
Vaccine effectiveness in the real world study varied by age. For those under age 60, the vaccine was 86% effective at preventing hospitalization versus 78% for those 60 and older.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A second woman has accused former Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc Chief Executive Leon Black of rape, saying he attacked her in the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's mansion in Manhattan in 2002.
The claim, by a woman identified as ""Jane Doe,"" was included in a proposed amended civil lawsuit filed on Monday night by Guzel Ganieva, who has accused https://www.reuters.com/business/womans-lawsuit-accuses-leon-black-defamation-violent-behavior-2021-06-01 the 70-year-old Black of rape and other sexual abuse and is seeking unspecified damages.
""This claim is complete fiction and has no basis in fact or law,"" a representative for Black said on Tuesday. ""It is telling that it is asserted anonymously and concerns events that allegedly occurred some 20 years ago.
""It is abundantly clear that the only goal here is to publicly destroy Mr. Black's personal and professional reputation and to defame him by perpetrating a baseless smear campaign,"" the representative added.
In earlier court filings, Black had forcefully denied https://www.reuters.com/world/us/leon-black-rejects-russian-womans-claims-violent-behavior-files-countersuit-2021-07-19 Ganieva's claims, including that he tried to arrange for her to have sex with Epstein https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/leon-black-says-accuser-eyeing-payday-made-up-jeffrey-epstein-claims-2021-09-08 in 2008.
According to Monday's filing with a New York state court in Manhattan, Doe was a struggling single mother and former model from New Jersey who had already given Epstein massages when he arranged for her to massage Black.
The filing said that after giving Doe $300, Black violently assaulted her and caused her ""tearing pain"" in the massage room in Epstein's mansion.
Black paid Doe $5,000 when they later met in Manhattan's St. Regis (NYSE:RGS) Hotel, after she ""allowed herself to be convinced to see him,"" the filing said.
She did not report the alleged rape at the time because a friend told her no one would believe her, the filing added.
Jeanne Christensen, a lawyer for Ganieva, said in an email that Doe cannot sue Black because the statute of limitations had run out.
""As to her identity, it is hard enough for women to come forward when they have civil claims – when they are in real fear of the person that already physically violated them,"" she added.
It is unclear whether a judge will let Ganieva formally file the amended lawsuit.
Black, who is married, has said he paid Ganieva $100,000 a month for several years not to discuss their consensual 6-1/2-year relationship after she tried to extort him of $100 million.
Those payments stopped after Ganieva, a former model, tweeted about Black in March.

Black stepped down https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-apollo-global-ceo/leon-black-step-downs-as-apollo-ceo-after-review-of-epstein-ties-idUKKBN29U2LK from Apollo this year after an outside independent review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning. The review also said Black was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Black has publicly regretted his involvement with Epstein.

Ash Williams, chief investment officer of the Florida State Board of Administration, which oversees pension assets, said at a webcast state hearing that ""we've not seen any meaningful response from Unilever"" after discussions with the company.
Unilever and Ben & Jerry's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Some other U.S. states have moved to sell Unilever stock and bonds after the Ben & Jerry's move https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/ben-jerrys-end-ice-cream-sales-occupied-palestinian-territories-2021-07-19, saying like Florida that the company violated rules against boycotts of Israel. 
Florida's funds have about $139 million worth of Unilever stock, bonds and subsidiary holdings. State rules would not require the sale of those assets but would prohibit pension leaders from further purchases as of Oct. 26 unless the company changes course. 
Vermont-based Ben & Jerry's said in July it would stop doing business in the ""Occupied Palestinian Territory"" that had been handled by a licensee partner since 1987. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.

London-based Unilever has said the decision was only that of Ben & Jerry's independent board. Unilever also has said it has a ""strong and long-lasting commitment to our business in Israel,"" where it employs nearly 2,000 people.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 12:07PM ET</span>",Macau casino and junket operators seek clarity over new gambling laws,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Senior Macau casino and junket executives met with authorities in the world's biggest gambling hub on Monday seeking details on proposed regulatory changes but received little in the way of clarity.
The 70-minute meeting, shown online, highlighted the uncertainty hanging over the industry since the government kicked off a regulatory overhaul on Sept. 14. That has sent shares in the hub's casinos plunging, especially as Macau's lucrative casino licenses are up for rebidding next year.
The meeting was the only official opportunity for the industry to air its views during the 45-day gaming consultation. It was attended by Sands China (OTC:SCHYY),  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF), Galaxy Entertainment, MGM China (OTC:MCHVY), Melco Resorts and SJM Holdings (OTC:SJMHF).
Macau authorities have identified nine areas of potential change including having government representatives supervise daily casino operations, the number of licenses, better regulation and employee welfare.
During the meeting, industry executives agreed that Macau's 20-year gaming law needs to be updated and vouched support for Macau’s development as an international tourism hub. Buddy Lam, Galaxy's senior vice president for public relations, told the meeting the company wanted more information on several areas including the introduction of government representatives and clarifications on potential responsibilities and penalties for criminal acts. The company is confident a ""balance could be reached between national interests and the demands of operators,"" he said. Macau lawyer Rui Cunha, who represented SJM, argued that the future license period should take into consideration investments made in the former Portuguese colony.
Junket operators, middlemen who bring in wealthy big whale Chinese gamblers to Macau, were more vocal, asking for clarity on amendments to criminalise accepting cash deposits, currently a common practice.
Kwok Chi Chung, president of the city's junket association, enquired how junket practices could be legalised and whether operators could raise capital from the public to help the junket industry have ""a better image."" An unrelenting crackdown by China on capital flight and illicit money transfers, has seen junket operators' portion of Macau's total gaming revenue slide to about a third compared with previous highs of around 80%. One key interest of concern is a proposed increase in local directors’ ownership of casino operators with investors fretting that U.S. casino operators such as Sands, Wynn and MGM face more risk compared to local rivals.

Currently Macau permanent residents have a 10% voting right in the operators. ""Should that change to an economic right there is a negative perception that Chinese investors may be given a chance to buy these companies at very low prices,"" said Louis Lau, director of investments at Brandes Investment Partners, which invests in Macau casinos. Sands China has lost some 37% in value since last week's announcement while Wynn Macau has slid 33% and MGM China has tumbled 26%.
Authorities are due to hold four more consultations, all with the public, in October.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Explainer: Why a crisis over power prices caused panic about CO2 supplies,"By Nigel Hunt
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain struck a deal https://www.reuters.com/article/power-prices-britain-cf/uk-strikes-deal-for-co2-producer-to-restart-operations-idUKS8N2OH01S with a major producer of fertiliser and carbon dioxide on Tuesday to restart two plants which had halted operations due to soaring prices for natural gas.
The closures had led to fears that the production of a wide range of food and drinks could be shut down within days.
WHY IS CARBON DIOXIDE IMPORTANT?
The food and drink industry is the largest user of carbon dioxide with the gas used in a wide range of beverages including beer and soft drinks.
In the meat sector, it's also used to stun animals prior to slaughter while bakers often use it in a packaging process which prolongs the life of products such as crumpets and cakes.
The gas has many other applications outside of food and drink including in medicine where it is used during a wide range of procedures from non-invasive surgery to the removal of warts.
The energy sector is also an important consumer with the nuclear industry, for example, using it as a coolant.
HOW IT IS PRODUCED?
Carbon dioxide is a by-product in the production of some fertilisers and biofuels.
In Britain, the largest sources include CF Fertilisers UK's plant in Billingham in northeast England and the company's Ince plant in north-west England.
HOW IT IS TRADED?
Fertiliser producers sell carbon dioxide to industrial gas companies such as Linde (NYSE:LIN) and Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY) who purify it to the required standard before selling it to consumers.
Carbon dioxide is sold through a mixture of contracts and spot sales.
WHY IS THERE A SHORTAGE?
CF Fertilisers halted production at its two British fertiliser plants last week due to soaring prices of natural gas, a key input in the production process.
This effectively removed a large chunk of supply from the market and there have been reports that carbon dioxide suppliers were not scheduling beyond 24 hours in advance.
Many consumers only have sufficient reserves of the gas to last a few days and this created fears that production of a wide range of products could be quickly brought to a halt.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 12:02PM ET</span>",UK's first green gilt draws record $137 billion demand,"By David Milliken and Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain sold 10 billion pounds of its first 'green' government bond on Tuesday after attracting over 100 billion pounds ($137 billion) of demand from investors, a record high that shows the clamour for assets that can be marketed as good for the planet.
Proceeds from the sale will be ring-fenced for projects such as offshore wind farms and zero-emission buses, and also help Britain's government polish its green credentials before hosting the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November.
Britain has lagged behind other European countries such as Germany, Italy and Spain in issuing this type of debt, partly because of concern that investors would want higher interest rates to compensate for a relative lack of liquidity.
However, investors' appetite for green debt has surged over the past year and a half - partly because of its appeal to funds dedicated to buying green assets, but also due to concern that regulators and other stakeholders will in the future look more closely at the overall environmental impact of portfolios. 
Tuesday's launch of the new gilt maturing in July 2033 represents the largest single sale by a sovereign issuer, topping the previous 8.5 billion euro record set by Italy in March.
""It's confirmation that the demand is there even in sterling, not just in euros,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING.
Britain aims to raise around 15 billion pounds in total this year from Tuesday's sale and a new 20- to 30-year maturity green gilt next month, a relatively small fraction of the 253 billion pounds in total gilt issuance that is planned.
Foreign investors made up 17% of the demand, above the 10% that is more typical at a gilt syndication. Part of the increased foreign demand reflected the shorter maturity of the gilt than is usual at British syndications, but the novelty of the green gilt was also a draw.
The more than 100 billion pounds in orders for the gilt were the highest ever for a British bond syndication, topping a previous record of 82.6 billion pounds in May 2020. Investors typically do not expect orders to be filled in full.
The new 2033 gilt will pay a coupon of 0.875% and has been priced to give a yield of 0.8721%, 7.5 basis points more than the conventional June 2032 gilt, at the tight end of initial guidance.
Asif Sherani, HSBC's head of EMEA debt capital markets syndicate, said this reflected a 2.5 basis point 'greenium' - the slightly lower yield green bonds offer versus conventional debt, generally due to a dedicated investor base chasing a limited supply of these assets. 
Matthew Amis, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said the gilt was less pricy than some other green debt - which is often expensive in the secondary market - and offered fair value versus conventional gilts.
""We expect this gilt to perform well in the coming days and months,"" he said.
The Bank of England has said it will buy green bonds as part of its asset purchase programme.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Citi,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC and J.P. Morgan acted as joint leads on the syndication.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>",Uber could post first adjusted profit this quarter as ride demand returns,"By Nivedita Balu and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc could post its first profit on an adjusted basis for the current quarter, reaching the elusive milestone sooner than expected as online food ordering surges and ride bookings recover from pandemic lows.
Shares of the company, which has spent billions over the last few years on growing its business, were up about 8% in early trading on Tuesday following the upbeat profit outlook.
The COVID-19 pandemic and a shortage of drivers crushed Uber and smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) last year, as most people worked from home or preferred to invest in a car. However, Uber's food delivery business boomed as more people ordered in.
Uber's projections come after Lyft last month posted an adjusted quarterly profit three months ahead of target, helped by lower costs and rising demand for rides as offices reopened. Uber had forecast to reach the milestone by the fourth quarter.
Uber said on Tuesday it was expecting adjusted EBITDA, a profitability metric it uses, to breakeven in the third quarter. It forecast between a loss of $25 million and a profit of $25 million, compared with the prior forecast of a loss of $100 million.
""We view this as a clear positive sign,"" MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni said, highlighting that Uber's shares have been under pressure, having lost most than a fifth of their value so far this year, as profitability remained uncertain and spending related to driver incentives were unclear. 
Over the past year, Uber has reduced staffing and offloaded its food delivery business in unprofitable markets to cut costs and emerge from the pandemic a slimmer company.
""We've not only grown our global leadership across both mobility and delivery; we've done so more profitably than ever before... Uber is reaching an important milestone,"" Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said.

Uber forecast gross bookings between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion in the third quarter compared with its prior forecast of $22 billion and $24 billion.
The revision is evidence that rides were returning to pre-COVID levels, said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.

The social media giant said it now has 40,000 people working on safety and security, compared with 10,000 five years ago.
Facebook played down the negative effects on young users of its Instagram app and had a weak response to alarms raised by employees over how the platform is used in developing countries by human traffickers, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing a review of internal company documents.
""In the past, we didn't address safety and security challenges early enough in the product development process,"" the company said in a blog post. ""But we have fundamentally changed that approach.""

Facebook said its artificial intelligence technology has helped it block 3 billion fake accounts in the first half of this year. The company also removed more than 20 million pieces of false COVID-19 and vaccine content.
The company said it now removes 15 times more content that violates its standards on hate speech across Facebook and its image-sharing platform Instagram than when it first began reporting it in 2017.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is pulling back from U.S. retail banking with the $8 billion sale of MUFG Union Bank (MUB) to U.S. Bancorp as digital technology and industry consolidation squeeze out smaller lenders.
The deal includes $5.5 billion in cash and $2.5 billion worth of shares that will give Japan's biggest lender a 2.9% stake in Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the fifth largest bank in the United States, the banks said on Tuesday. 
Following the deal, which it expects to close by the end of June next year, MUFG will focus on corporate and investment banking in the United States through other units and through its partnership with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which is a fifth owned by the Japanese bank. 
""We can't succeed without a certain scale of business,"" Morito Emi, a managing director for corporate planning at the Japanese bank, said at a press briefing. ""There's a lot of mergers and acquisitions going on there,"" he added.
In order to compete, MUB, which has around 300 branches mostly on the West Coast of the United States, would have had to invest heavily in new digital technology to keep pace with bigger rivals offering new online banking services, Emi said.
The pandemic has further emphasized longstanding trends facing U.S. banks. Historically low interest rates have made earning profits tough, and lockdown measures to contain the virus have made consumers more comfortable utilizing digital channels, forcing greater spending on technology.
Consolidation has been one way to address these challenges, with deals reaching $55 billion in value last year, the highest in more than a decade.
Much activity has been focused on the mid-sized and larger regional lenders, who are trying to keep up with the big four national banks. The combination which created Truist Financial Corp (N:TFC), completed in December 2019, kicked off a mini wave that saw banks including PNC Financial Services (N:PNC) and Citizens Financial Group (N:CFG) announce transactions.
STRATEGY
For U.S. Bancorp, the MUB deal boosts its presence in California to become the fifth-largest deposit holder in the most populous American state, according to a statement.
The acquisition is being made at 1.3-times MUB's tangible book value, a common indicator used to judge bank mergers, while U.S. Bancorp said it will extract $900 million of cost savings from integrating systems and combining real estate footprints.
The exit from MUB is the latest departure from U.S. retail banking by non-American lenders, which have struggled to compete against domestic rivals. Spain's BBVA (MC:BBVA) completed offloading its operations to PNC in June, and HSBC agreed in May to sell or wind down its branches.
MUFG's push into U.S. banking had been part of a strategy to expand business overseas to boost profits because ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking population in Japan have made it difficult to earn at home.
The deal with U.S. Bancorp comes as MUFG shifts its focus more to other parts of Asia.
Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) in 2008 paid around $3.5 billion for the third of Mitsubishi Union Bank it did not already control. With assets of $132 billion, it provides corporate, commercial and retail banking as well as wealth management. 
In addition to the $8 billion of cash and stock from U.S. Bancorp, the Japanese parent will also get around $9.6 billion from dividends or share repurchases at MUB, bringing the total value of the transaction to $17.6 billion.

Part of MUB's administrative functions and its corporate and investment banking departments will be transferred to other parts of MUFG's U.S. operations.

British-born Manley took over as CEO of FCA in July 2018 after long-time chief Sergio Marchionne, a charismatic and iconic figure credited with saving Fiat, fell ill and died suddenly after succumbing to complications from surgery. 
Manley, 57, led FCA until January 2021, when the company merged with PSA to form Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker, a merger that he helped negotiate.
Manley, who also oversaw the successful overhaul of FCA's high-margin Jeep and RAM brands, currently serves as Head of Americas for Stellantis, with North America being the group's most profitable region.
Under Manley, Stellantis' North America region posted a record 16.1% adjusted operating profit margin in the first half of this year.
By 1440 GMT Milan-listed shares in Stellantis were down 0.1%, underperforming a 1.3% rise in Italy's blue-chip index. AutoNation shares were flat. 
""It's been my privilege to know Mike first as a competitor, then as a partner and colleague in the creation of Stellantis, but most importantly, always as a friend,"" said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, who formerly lead PSA. 
Stellantis said that Manley will join the board of the Stellantis Foundation, the carmaker's charitable arm.
An investment banker, who has worked with FCA, said Manley's ambition was to become a CEO again.
""I think he realized he had to wait too much time to go back to the top in Stellantis,"" he said.
Stellantis said its chief operating officers of North America and Latin America would now report directly to the group's CEO Tavares. (https:// Manley will take charge at Ft.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>",Universal Music dances to $55 billion in electric stock market debut,"By Toby Sterling and Sudip Kar-Gupta
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Universal Music Group's shares leapt more than a third in their stock market debut on Tuesday as investors bet a boom in music streaming still has a long way to run.
The world's biggest music label, which represents musicians and song catalogues from Billie Eilish to The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, saw its market value leap to 47 billion euros ($55 billion) in Europe's largest listing of the year. 
The company was spun off by France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which handed a 60% stake in Universal to its shareholders. Vivendi saw its market value drop by two thirds to about 12 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data, as it refocuses on other media assets such as pay TV brand Canal+.
Big winners from the Amsterdam listing include U.S. hedge fund billionaire William Ackman and China's Tencent, alongside Vivendi's controlling shareholder Vincent Bollore, who are retaining large slices of Universal. 
Universal Chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge will also get bonuses linked to the listing that a source close to the company said would amount to at least $140 million.
Universal's shares were trading at 24.97 euros by mid-session trading, up around 35% from their reference price of 18.50 euros. Shares in Bollore, which holds 27% of Vivendi, were up 2.4%, while the Amsterdam-listed shares of Ackman's Pershing were up 4%.
At that price, Universal - the biggest of the ""big three"" record labels - trades at a 25% premium to its only listed competitor, Warner Music, said analyst Matti Littunen of Bernstein. Both compete with  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music.
""No sign of a European discount here,"" Littunen said in a note, adding that the stock's performance would reduce pressure to seek a dual U.S. listing for Universal, which is based in Hilversum, Netherlands, but has headquarters in Santa Monica, California.
The strong debut is also a vindication for Ackman, who was forced into an embarrassing U-turn after U.S. regulators blocked his plans to invest into Universal via his special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in July. 
Ackman, whose grandfather was a songwriter, instead opted to take a 10% stake via his main Pershing Square hedge fund, which is now sitting on a paper gain of more than 30%. 
BEATLES TO BIEBER
Amid the streaming boom https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6q2hD/4, Universal - whose other hit singers and catalogues include Justin Bieber and The Beatles - hopes to build on deals with ad-supported sites such as TikTok and YouTube as well as streamers led by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
""I believe that we're only at the beginning of the next wave of growth as music subscription and ad-supported consumption is scaling globally and has a long runaway ahead,"" Grainge told Reuters.
Part of Universal's business derives from the rights attached to its huge catalogue, and it also collects royalties for the artists it represents across social media platforms and performance fees whenever their songs are played. 
The COVID-19 pandemic hit live concerts and Universal's merchandising business, but ad-supported revenues have picked up after a blip. 
Its flotation carries high stakes for Vivendi, which hopes to rid itself of a conglomerate discount that it believes has weighed on its shares.
Vivendi said last week it was set to purchase another stake in Lagardere, paving the way for a potential full takeover of the Paris Match magazine owner.
Universal has increased sales for six years in a row, with core earnings of 1.36 billion euros in 2020 on revenue of 7.43 billion euros. It has forecast revenue growth of at least 10% this year and in the high single digits after that.
The listing is the latest win for Euronext in Amsterdam, which has grown as a financial centre since Britain's departure from the European Union. Before Universal, Amsterdam had attracted a record 14 IPOs this year.

The deal was handled by 17 banks which are expected to make a combined $60-$65 million in fees from advising Vivendi and Universal, with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and other lead advisers taking the largest share, according to Refinitiv estimates.

While a few stocks in this space, including Iridium Communication (IRDM), Globalstar (NYSE:GSAT) Inc. (SAT), and AST SpaceMobile (ASTS), advanced in price solely on rumors that AAPL’s iPhone 13 is satellite compatible, they plummeted shortly after mobile analysts denied such rumors. So, we believe these stocks are best avoided now. Read on to learn more.
Businesses are increasingly turning to satellite communication (SATCOM) to make their operations more efficient. In addition, companies with operations in distant areas rely heavily on satellite communication to provide real-time asset and facility monitoring.
However, pandemic-induced business disruptions are still impeding the SATCOM industry. Consequently, industry participants are not only concerned about technological advancement but also regulatory decisions, standards and protocols, capital financing, and consumer-oriented digital market dynamics.
Despite the concerns surrounding the SATCOM industry’s growth prospects, shares of  Iridium Communications  Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM),  Globalstar Inc . (GSAT), and AST SpaceMobile Inc. (ASTS) skyrocketed in price based on rumors that Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently launched iPhone 13 will be satellite compatible. However, mobile analysts and communication specialists eventually refuted the speculation, resulting in a trend reversal for these stocks. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these fundamentally weak SATCOM stocks.

The lawsuit will argue that the alliance between the two airlines threatens competition, with the potential for making travel costlier for passengers, according to the report.
Under a code share agreement announced on July 16, the two carriers agreed to market one another’s flights at the three New York area airports and in Boston.
The carriers began implementing the partnership this year after agreeing to shed some slots at airports in New York and Washington to secure the Transportation Department’s approval.

LONDON (Reuters) - Blockchain-based fantasy soccer game Sorare has raised $680 million in a funding round led by SoftBank, with players including ex-England international Rio Ferdinand and Spain's Gerard Pique also investing, the company said on Tuesday.
Paris-based Sorare said the investment valued the company at $4.3 billion.
Founded in 2018, Sorare is an online game where players buy officially licensed cards representing soccer players and build teams which play against each other, with the outcome based on the players' performance in real-life games.
The cards are traded in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a kind of crypto asset which records the ownership status of digital goods on the blockchain.
The market for NFTs has seen explosive growth in 2021, with collectible and sports-related the most popular types of token.
""We think NFTs represent a new paradigm in the collectability, usability, and engagement with assets,"" Michel Combes, president of SoftBank Group International, said in emailed comments.
""This evolution from physical assets to digital assets is very powerful, and creates a lot of exciting potential business models.""
Sorare is the largest sports-based NFT platform by sales volume, according to NonFungible.com, a website which tracks NFT market data. It plans to open an office in the United States and expand into sports other than soccer.
""We saw the immense potential that blockchain and NFTs brought to unlock a new way for football clubs, footballers, and their fans to experience a deeper connection with each other,"" said Nicolas Julia, CEO and co-founder of Sorare.
""We believe this is a huge opportunity to create the next sports entertainment giant.""
Since January 2021, there have been $150 million of sales on Sorare, which accepts payments via credit card and the cryptocurrency ether. The most expensive unique card is of Cristiano Ronaldo, which was bought for 245,072 euros ($287,420.44) on March 13.
The fundraising round was SoftBank's first time investing in Sorare, via its SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
SoftBank's Latin America fund also contributed, which Combes said was because SoftBank can use its relationships with U.S. and Latin American soccer leagues and its investment in broadcaster Televisa-Univision, to increase Sorare's user base there.
This is not SoftBank's first foray into NFTs: it also led investment in the NFT marketplace OpenSea in July and invested in the decentralised finance platform Juggernaut in March.

Other investors in Sorare's raise include: venture capital firms Accel and Bessemer Ventures as well as the footballers Pique, Ferdinand, France's Antoine Griezmann and Spain's Cesar Azpilicueta.

624,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 09:54AM ET</span>",Universal Shares Soar as Music Giant Makes $53 Billion Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- Universal Music Group BV shares soared in their stock market debut as investors seized the chance to own the dominant player in a resurgent music industry. 
Spun off from French media company Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SE, UMG hit the Amsterdam stock market with a value of 45.4 billion euros ($53.2 billion). The listing comes days after the U.S. recorded music sector reported strong sales growth driven by a surge in streaming audiences on platforms such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music during the pandemic. 
UMG is seen by analysts as the overwhelming winner in new markets because it produces more stars and hit songs than its rivals,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. UMG controls about 40% of the industry and that success helps it to lure the next generation of talent. Nine of the top 10 selling musicians worldwide last year were UMG artists, according to global industry body IFPI. 
While streaming is showing signs of peaking in some markets -- and many artists are still reeling from the hit to touring income caused by the pandemic -- analysts have been ratcheting up their valuations of the company behind Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, Elton John and the Beatles to take account of new revenue streams from e-commerce, video games and fitness apps. 
The spinoff will also result in a bumper windfall for Lucian Grainge, UMG’s chief executive officer, who could receive over $150 million following the deal. 
The stock jumped 36% to 25.14 euros in Amsterdam from the reference price of 18.50 euros. Vivendi shares rose 21% to 11.08 euros after adjusting for the value of the spinoff.
The challenge for UMG will be to keep its pole position when a new generation of smaller, digital-focused competitors are trying to draw artists away from the majors by giving them more control and more choice on which label services to use. UMG has ratcheted up spending on new musicians and songwriters in the past two years as that competitive environment inflates talent costs.  
“As hit music continues to see its market value spiral ever-upwards, the majors become ever-more competitive with each other and with newer industry upstarts like Hipgnosis to sign and own the rights,” said Tim Ingham, founder of music industry news and analysis site Music Business Worldwide.  
UMG, Sony and Warner have responded to the competitive threat by letting musicians pick and choose the label services they want -- while still allowing them to benefit from the majors’ powerful global marketing and distribution machines. 
UMG’s “recent capital markets day underlined its powerful position in the industry and highlighted strong current growth trends,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a research note this month. The firm is advising Vivendi on the spinoff.
More Control 
Vivendi spun off 60% of UMG to its stockholders -- giving them one share of the music business for each Vivendi share held -- and is retaining a 10% stake. 
Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management LP hedge fund bought 10% of UMG from Vivendi over the past couple of months, and a consortium led by China’s Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. owns the remaining 20%.
Vivendi and its controlling shareholder, billionaire Vincent Bollore, have taken a hands-off approach to its most lucrative asset, leaving Grainge and his executive team in charge of major decision making. 
For that reason, analysts don’t expect UMG’s transition to publicly listed status to lead to any immediate change in strategy, or the way that Grainge runs the business.  
Music has made a dramatic recovery from the start of the century, when the internet killed the market for CDs. 
The labels still have work to do to get tech startups and social media companies to license music and take down tracks they haven’t paid for.
But streaming is making the business more predictable thanks to the reams of data they can harvest on audience tastes from social media and platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. 
“Much rarer are the occasions when a major label would risk a $10 million advance on an artist whose record then flops, and who then walks away from the deal leaving the major millions of dollars in debt,” said Ingham.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 09:42AM ET</span>","As America reopens, airlines hunger to reclaim transatlantic cash","By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Sarah Young
CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) -America's reopening to international air travelers can't come soon enough for U.S. and European airlines which have sorely missed the lucrative transatlantic market.
The Biden administration's decision https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/us-relax-travel-restrictions-passengers-uk-eu-november-source-2021-09-20 on Monday to reopen the country to fully-vaccinated air travelers from around the world will allow tens of thousands of passengers to fly to the United States from early November. 
For the large traditional European airline players, like British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, it represents a chance to recover the transatlantic routes that are key to their profits. 
U.S. carriers, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), will also benefit, although their finances had already been helped by a recovery in the large U.S. domestic market to near pre-pandemic levels.
""The transatlantic market is a key profit generator for the main European legacy airline groups,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. 
Pre-pandemic, in 2019, those routes accounted for more than 26% of IAG's revenues, Roeska estimates, over 24% of Lufthansa's and over 16% of Air France-KLM's. Transatlantic flights accounted for between 11% and 17% of U.S. airlines passenger revenues that year. 
Shares in IAG rose 4% on Tuesday, having jumped 11% on Monday when the White House announced the reopening. Air France was up 3% on Tuesday. 
The news will also benefit British-based airline Virgin Atlantic, a transatlantic specialist, which has turned to cargo to help it survive the pandemic. 
LEAN WINTER 
The lifting of restrictions coincides with the onset of winter season, historically a lean period for international travel, when many airlines tend to make a loss. 
Colin Scarola, vice president equity research at CFRA Research, said the decision would encourage companies to approve overseas business trips, yet COVID-19 risks remain, and he does not expect international travel to rebound to pre-pandemic levels before late 2022.
British Airways said that its customers were keen to fly again, citing an increase of nearly 700% in searches for holidays to U.S. destinations like New York, Orlando, Las Vegas and Miami on its website on Monday, versus the same day last week. 
In the United States, though, airlines fear the travel recovery could by blunted by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
While Europe has been contending with the fast-spreading variant for months, it hit the United States later and carriers there have warned this month about the consequent financial hit. 
Several airlines have slashed revenue forecasts, citing a slowdown in bookings and increased cancellations. 

Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James, called the White House's decision an ""incremental positive"" that would give U.S. carriers clarity for next year's summer travel season. Yet it did not prompt her to revise her financial estimates for them or the outlook for air-travel.
In early September, U.S. airline passenger volumes for international travel were just 44% of the pre-pandemic levels, according to data from trade body Airlines for America.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, rebounding from their worst day in months on Monday as nerves about the Chinese real estate debt crisis eased. 
Better-than-expected data from the housing market also supported sentiment. Housing starts and building permits for August both came in above expectations, albeit not by enough to cause any acceleration in the  Federal Reserve's timeline for running down its asset purchases or raising interest rates. The Fed's latest two-day policy meeting starts later Tuesday.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 232 points, or 0.7%, at 34,202 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
China Evergrande Group's (OTC:EGRNY)'s looming default - it has already skipped payments to banking creditors - continues to occupy minds, with many mindful of the fact that it could become the second-biggest bankruptcy in history, after Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008.
Wall Street analysts - who hardly distinguished themselves ahead of that fiasco - have been playing down the risk of a systemic financial crisis in China, pointing to the still-extensive range of options available to Beijing.
""We do not see the Evergrande crisis as China's Lehman moment"", analysts at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) wrote, because policymakers will likely prevent systematic risk ""to buy time for resolving the debt, and push forward marginal easing for the overall credit environment.""
Mainland Chinese stock markets reopen after a long holiday weekend on Wednesday, and most analysts expect an announcement of at least some measures before then. 
Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock stood out in early dealings, rising 7.6% after a securities filing in which the company said it expects to make a profit at the level of adjusted EBITDA - its preferred metric - in the current quarter, thanks to a rebound in its ride-hailing business and sustained strength in food delivery. It had previously said that its first profit might have to wait until the final quarter of 2021 or even later.  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock rose 2.8% in sympathy.
Elsewhere, Quantumscape (NYSE:QS) stock emerged from a five-month coma, rising 16% after the company said it had signed an agreement with another 'top 10' automaker, which it said had ""committed to collaborate with the Company to evaluate prototypes of the Company’s solid-state battery cells, and to purchase 10 (megawatt-hours) of capacity from the Company’s pre-pilot production line facility.""
Quantumscape's claims that it was closing in on a breakthrough in so-called 'solid-state' battery technology, promising a game-changing increase in the power of electric vehicle batteries, came under a harsh spotlight earlier in the year, after short-seller Scorpion Capital published an investigation into its alleged shortcomings. That caused the stock of the Volkswagen-backed company to fall over 90% from its peak. 
Vaccine makers were also in demand, with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) rising 1.5% and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rising 1.2%, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock rose 0.6% after it said its single-shot vaccine demonstrated much higher effectiveness with a booster shot after several weeks."

Read on.Uranium mining and exploration company  Uranium Energy Corp .

It holds interest in several projects, including Palangana mine in Texas, Slick Rock in Colorado, and Alto Parana titanium projects in Paraguay. 
UEC’s stock has gained 84.1% in price so far this year and 62% over the past month. This can be attributed primarily to uranium prices hitting an eight-year high this month, following the recent launch of an exchange-traded trust by Sprott Asset Management LP and the growing utilization of nuclear power as a low carbon emission energy option.
But UEC’s stock is currently trading 20.7% below its 52-week high of $3.77. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic-related supply disruptions on uranium mining and issues with processing activities could make it challenging to meet the growing demand. And the industry’s cyclical nature only makes matters worse. This volatile backdrop could cause the stock to experience a downtrend.

Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary was quoted as telling the Financial Times last week that rivals easyJet and Wizz Air would need to merge or be taken over as the industry consolidates in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""(It is) complete nonsense,"" easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren told Reuters in an interview. ""I would urge anyone who runs an airline to focus on their own business rather than speculate about others, (where) they have no idea about what's going on.""
Lundgren said consolidation was already taking place in Europe as weaker airlines cancel capacity, and that easyJet was not opposed in principle to consolidation carried out in the form of external transactions.
""We are not against any M&A type of activity but it needs to be able to deliver value for shareholders and to deliver a reason to believe in a successful outcome,"" he said.
Asked whether easyJet saw itself as a buyer in any future shake-out of the European airline industry, Lundgren said: ""We would be looking at companies, as I am sure companies would be looking at us. There is no drama around that at all.""
Tensions had flared days after easyJet said it had rejected a takeover approach from Wizz Air that would have created a low-cost airline to rival Ryanair, opting instead to raise $1.7 billion from shareholders.
Lundgren said the rights issue was attracting broad investor support, but acknowledged some discussions about the timing.

""As with anything, we are having discussions about the size and the timing, but also the need we have to make sure we are right-funded to make sure we can invest in growth when those opportunities come,"" he said.

Investing.com – Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) stock jumped 6% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after the company said it will reach an adjusted profit already in the current quarter, sooner than had been expected.
Uber projects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other costs between a loss of $25 million and a profit of $25 million in the third quarter that ends in nine days' time. It was earlier expected to post a loss of under $100 million by that measure.
“With positive adjusted ebitda in July and August, we believe Uber is now tracking towards adjusted ebitda break-even in Q3, well ahead of our prior guidance,” chief financial officer Nelson Chai said in the filing.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of basic operating profit. An adjusted profit is expected in the next quarter as well, the company said.
Strong demand at Uber Eats, its online food ordering services, and a recovery in cab bookings are driving the company’s optimism.
Smaller rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) had earlier beaten Uber in forecasting an adjusted profit when it said in April that it will turn a corner by the end of this year.

MADRID (Reuters) - A rush to buy after the end of coronavirus lockdowns has reduced the stock of homes for sale in Spain's big cities by 4% over the past year, data from leading property advertising portal Idealista on Tuesday showed. 
Madrid and the Mediterranean seaside town Valencia both saw their pool of homes for sale drop by 11%, while in the Andalusian tourism hubs of Seville and Malaga the available stock dropped by 6% and 5% respectively over the same period.
Pent-up demand during the first 9 months of 2020 meant that when the harshest coronavirus restrictions in Europe were lifted in September 2020, people rushed to buy homes.
Some Spaniards sought a change of scenery after being confined to their homes for extended periods, while a 6.6% rise in household saving during 2020, according to research by Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA), meant they had more cash for deposits once restrictions eased.
Among the most striking drops in the availability of housing for sale was the northern city of Pamplona, famed for its San Fermin bull-running fiesta, which saw its stock plunge 28% from September 2020, the Idealista data shows.
Barcelona, where the local government established rent controls in September last year, was the only exception, with some 7% more homes for sale than 12 months ago.
""It could be related to the caps on rental prices - landlords might prefer not to rent out their properties and opt to sell them instead,"" a source with knowledge of Catalonia's real estate market told Reuters.

""There are 40% fewer properties available to rent in Barcelona now than a year ago,"" the source added.

Investing.com – AstraZeneca ADRs (NASDAQ:AZN) traded 1% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as the proposed changes to rules governing travel to the U.S. will accommodate those vaccinated by the company’s Covid-19 shots.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is still not approved by the U.S. drugs regulator. But according to comments made by Anthony Fauci, a top infectious diseases expert who heads the U.S. response to the pandemic, it looks like those vaccinated by the vaccine will face no problem entering the U.S.  
“Given we have a substantial amount of information on the AZ vaccine . . . I would predict it would not be a problem,” he said, according to The Times of London.
The U.S. eased travel rules Monday, allowing fully vaccinated travelers to enter the country from November onward without them having to quarantine. They will have to present a proof of vaccination before boarding and proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of the flight.
The easing of travel rules and Fauci’s comments added to the positive sentiment for the stock generated by the findings of a study involving the company’s potential drug to treat breast cancer. The company on Saturday said Enhertu, an antibody drug conjugate, demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the existing treatment. The company is jointly developing the drug with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo (T:4568).

634,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Explainer-Why are BMW and Daimler being sued over climate change?,"By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - German activists have filed a lawsuit against automakers BMW and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) for refusing to tighten carbon emissions goals, the first time German citizens have sued private companies for exacerbating climate change.
The lawsuit from the heads of Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), is similar to one being lined up for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) by the heads of Greenpeace's Germany division in collaboration with Fridays for Future activist Clara Mayer and an unidentified landowner. However, this group has given Volkswagen until Oct. 29 to respond.
DUH also challenged energy firm Wintershall to restrict its emissions targets, but no suit has been filed against the company as of yet.
Here's what the cases mean, and why they matter.
WHERE HAS THIS COME FROM?
In May last year, Germany's top court ruled the country's climate law was not doing enough to protect future generations. It set carbon emissions budgets for major economic sectors, increased the percentage by which emissions must be reduced from 1990 levels by 2030 to 65% from 55%, and stated that Germany as a country must be carbon-neutral by 2045.
While meeting these demands implies some restrictions to current generations' lifestyles, not meeting them would force future generations to make significantly more drastic sacrifices in order to both survive in a warmer world, and prevent the problem from getting worse, the court argued at the time. 
In the same month, environmental groups in the Netherlands won a case against oil company Shell (LON:RDSa) for not doing enough to mitigate its impact on the climate – the first private firm to be ordered by a court to reduce its emissions.
On the back of those two rulings, the German activists are making their case. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
This case is important on two levels.
Firstly, because of the legal precedent it could set - namely, that companies are directly responsible for the effect on people's lives of the emissions their products create. 
If the defendants win, citizens could be emboldened to sue other companies – from airlines to retailers to energy firms – for not doing enough to mitigate their impact on the planet.
Secondly, because companies will be forced to prove in court that their emissions targets are as watertight as they say they are – stress-testing their claims that they are taking climate change seriously. 
WHY THESE COMPANIES? 
Daimler and BMW have set a number of climate-related targets.
Daimler aims to produce purely electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, and provide an electric alternative for all models by 2025. BMW wants at least half of global sales to be EVs by 2030, and reduce CO2 emissions per vehicle by 40% in the same timeframe. Volkswagen has said it will stop producing fossil fuel-emitting cars by 2035. 
All three firms have stated that their targets are in line with the international Paris Agreement on tackling global warming.
But the defendants argue that the companies' goals aren't enough to adhere to the German climate ruling and carbon emissions budgets set by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).
By prolonging carbon-emitting activities, the companies are directly responsible for the constraints on individual rights that will have to endured in future if carbon budgets aren't stuck to, the case argues. 
These are by no means the only firms to which such an argument could apply - and if DUH wins, more lawsuits could follow.
WHAT DO THEY WANT?
DUH wants both autos firms to legally commit to ending production of fossil fuel-emitting cars by 2030, and to ensure the CO2 emitted by their activities before those deadlines does not go beyond their fair share. 
What do they mean by their fair share? It's a complex calculation – but put simply, the NGO has calculated a personal ‘carbon budget’ for each company, based on a figure put together by the IPCC of how much carbon we can still emit globally without warming the Earth beyond 1.7 degrees Celsius, and how much carbon the companies emitted in 2019.
According to its calculations, the companies' current climate goals aren't enough to keep them within their allocated budget – meaning that even if everyone else sticks to their budgets, these companies' activities would push emissions over the limit.
WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID? 
Daimler said on Monday it did not see any grounds for the case. ""We have long provided a clear statement for the path to climate neutrality: it is our aim to be fully electric by the end of the decade - wherever market conditions allow,"" it said in a statement.
BMW said its climate targets were already at the forefront of the industry, and its goals were in line with the ambition of keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees.
Volkswagen said it would consider the case, but that it ""does not view suing individual firms as a suitable method to tackle societal challenges.""
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
It's now up to Germany's district court to decide whether the case should be taken forward. If it thinks so, the companies will be asked to present evidence to defend themselves against the charges, and a written debate between the two sides will ensue.

A ruling could be years away. But the longer it takes, the higher the risk to the companies if they lose - as they could be left with very little time left to meet any court demands by 2030.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) said on Tuesday it is adding smoked brisket to its menu in the United States and Canada after testing it last year. 
The new menu item, which costs $10.25 on average as an entree in Chipotle restaurants, comes as beef prices rise. 
""We have established long-term relationships with certain key suppliers and therefore, been able to secure acceptable pricing for our initiatives,"" said Carlos Londono, the company's head of supply chain. 
Beef and veal prices were up 48% in August versus January, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Chipotle tested the smoked brisket in Sacramento, California, and in Cincinnati, Ohio, last year. Its $10.25 average price for its brisket is higher than other beef entrees in one Chipotle location in downtown Sacramento.
A burrito with steak or barbacoa for pickup would start at $9.20 in the Sacramento location, according to its website. In the test markets, an entree with brisket had cost $9.50, the company said. 

The smoked brisket will be available to Chipotle U.S. rewards members on Tuesday and Wednesday.
It will be available to all customers in the United States and Canada on Sept. 23 and on third-party delivery apps starting Sept. 27.

Europe's largest low cost carrier earlier this month abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemaker over a new order of the larger 737 MAX 10 jets, worth tens of billions of dollars, due to differences over price.

Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said that ""Europe's low cost carriers will drive demand for Airbus A320 family aircraft and not Boeing"" unless it cuts its prices and does a deal with Ryanair.
He made the comments in a letter responding to a Reuters article that quoted a Boeing executive forecasting low-cost carriers would drive growth.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock traded more than 1% up in Tuesday’s premarket on encouraging results from a phase-III real-world study on a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine.
The company said its booster shot is 94% effective when administered two months after the first dose. It said the booster increases antibody levels by four to six times relative to one shot.
Boosters given six months after the first shot appear to give even higher protection, the company said. All rises were irrespective of age, the company said.
J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine is the only one approved by western economies that is administered with a single dose.
Around 14.8 million Americans have received the company’s single-dose vaccine so far. The study included 390,000 people who received the J&J Covid-19 vaccine.
An advisory committee on Friday recommended  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) booster shots to people 65 years and older, along with other vulnerable population groups. A final decision from the Food and Drug Administration is expected any day now. The panel voted against endorsing Covid-19 booster shots widely, a plan that the Biden administration favored.
The administration’s plans on boosters have received flak from various quarters, notably the World Health Organization, as much of the world is still unvaccinated, allowing the virus to spread and mutate freely in those countries.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",A life and death question for regulators: Is Tesla's Autopilot safe?,"By Hyunjoo Jin, Mike Spector and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Robin Geoulla had doubts about the automated driving technology equipped on his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S when he bought the electric car in 2017.
“It was a little scary to, you know, rely on it and to just, you know, sit back and let it drive,” he told a U.S. investigator about Tesla’s Autopilot system, describing his initial feelings about the technology. 
Geoulla made the comments to the investigator in January 2018, days after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, slammed into the back of an unoccupied fire truck parked on a California interstate highway. Reuters could not reach him for additional comment. 
Over time, Geoulla's initial doubts about Autopilot softened, and he found it reliable when tracking a vehicle in front of him. But he noticed the system sometimes seemed confused when faced with direct sunlight or a vehicle in front of him changing lanes, according to a transcript of his interview with a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator. 
He was driving into the sun before he rear-ended the fire truck, he told the investigator.
Autopilot’s design allowed Geoulla to disengage from driving during his trip, and his hands were off the wheel for almost the entire period of roughly 30 minutes when the technology was activated, the NTSB found.
The U.S. agency, which makes recommendations but lacks enforcement powers, has previously urged regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to investigate Autopilot's limitations, potential for driver misuse and possible safety risks following a series of crashes involving the technology, some of them fatal.
""The past has shown the focus has been on innovation over safety and I’m hoping we’re at a point where that tide is turning,"" the NTSB's new chair, Jennifer Homendy, told Reuters in an interview. She said there is no comparison between Tesla's Autopilot and the more rigorous autopilot systems used in aviation that involve trained pilots, rules addressing fatigue and testing for drugs and alcohol. 
Tesla did not respond to written questions for this story.
Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance feature whose current version does not render vehicles autonomous, the company says on its website. Tesla says that drivers must agree to keep hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles before enabling the system.
LIMITED VISIBILITY 
Geoulla’s 2018 crash is one of 12 accidents involving Autopilot that NHTSA officials are scrutinizing as part of the agency’s farthest-reaching investigation since Tesla Inc introduced the semi-autonomous driving system in 2015. 
Most of the crashes under investigation occurred after dark or in conditions creating limited visibility such as glaring sunlight, according to a NHTSA statement, NTSB documents and police reports reviewed by Reuters. That raises questions about Autopilot’s capabilities during challenging driving conditions, according to autonomous driving experts.
""NHTSA’s enforcement and defect authority is broad, and we will act when we detect an unreasonable risk to public safety,"" a NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.
Since 2016, U.S. auto safety regulators have separately sent 33 special crash investigation teams to review Tesla crashes involving 11 deaths in which advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of being in use. NHTSA has ruled out Autopilot use in three of those nonfatal crashes. 
The current NHTSA investigation https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-opens-formal-safety-probe-into-tesla-autopilot-crashes-2021-08-16 of Autopilot in effect reopens the question of whether the technology is safe. It represents the latest significant challenge for Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive whose advocacy of driverless cars has helped his company become the world's most valuable automaker https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stocks-int/tesla-market-value-crosses-800-billion-for-the-first-time-idUSKBN29D20B. 
Tesla charges customers up to $10,000 for advanced driver assistance features such as lane changing, with a promise to eventually deliver autonomous driving capability to their cars using only cameras and advanced software. Other carmakers and self-driving firms use not only cameras but more expensive hardware including radar and lidar in their current and upcoming vehicles.
Musk has said a Tesla with eight cameras will be far safer than human drivers. But the camera technology is affected by darkness and sun glare as well as inclement weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow and fog, experts and industry executives say.
""Today's computer vision is far from perfect and will be for the foreseeable future,"" said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 
In the first known fatal U.S. crash involving Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving technology, which occurred in 2016 west of Williston, Florida, the company said both the driver and Autopilot failed to see the white side of a tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky. Instead of braking, the Tesla collided with the 18-wheel truck. 
DRIVER MISUSE, FAILED BRAKING
NHTSA in January 2017 closed an investigation of Autopilot stemming from that fatal crash, finding no defect in the Autopilot performance after some contentious exchanges with Tesla officials, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. 
In December 2016, as part of that probe, the agency asked Tesla to provide details on the company's response to any internal safety concerns raised about Autopilot, including the potential for driver misuse or abuse, according to a special order sent by regulators to the automaker.
After a NHTSA lawyer found Tesla's initial response lacking, Tesla's then-general counsel, Todd Maron, tried again. He told regulators the request was ""grossly overbroad"" and that it would be impossible to catalog all concerns raised during Autopilot's development, according to correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
Nevertheless, Tesla wanted to co-operate, Maron told regulators. During Autopilot’s development, company employees or contractors had raised concerns that Tesla addressed regarding the potential for unintended or failed braking and acceleration; undesired or failed steering; and certain kinds of misuse and abuse by drivers, Maron said, without providing further details.
Maron did not respond to messages seeking comment. 
It is not clear how regulators responded. One former U.S. official said Tesla generally co-operated with the probe and produced requested materials promptly. Regulators closed the investigation just before former U.S. president Donald Trump's inauguration, finding Autopilot performed as designed and that Tesla took steps to prevent it from being misused. 
LEADERSHIP VACUUM IN NHTSA
NHTSA has been without a Senate-confirmed chief for nearly five years. President Joe Biden has yet to nominate anyone to run the agency. 
NHTSA documents show that regulators want to know how Tesla vehicles attempt to see flashing lights on emergency vehicles, or detect the presence of fire trucks, ambulances and police cars in their path. The agency has sought similar information from 12 rival automakers as well.
""Tesla has been asked to produce and validate data as well as their interpretation of that data. NHTSA will conduct our own independent validation and analysis of all information,"" NHTSA told Reuters.
Musk, the electric-car pioneer, has fought hard to defend Autopilot from critics and regulators. Tesla has used Autopilot’s ability to update vehicle software over the air to outpace and sidestep the traditional vehicle-recall process. 
Musk has repeatedly promoted Autopilot’s capabilities https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autonomous-factbox/elon-musk-on-teslas-self-driving-capabilities-idUSKCN1RY0QY, sometimes in ways that critics say mislead customers into believing Teslas can drive themselves - despite warnings to the contrary in owner's manuals that tell drivers to remain engaged and outline the technology's limitations. 

Musk has also continued to launch what Tesla calls beta - or unfinished - versions of a ""Full Self-Driving"" system via over-the-air software upgrades.
""Some manufacturers are going to do what they want to do to sell a car and it’s up the government to rein that in,"" the NTSB's Homendy said.

640,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",U.S. agency confirms air bag safety probe into 30 million vehicles,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety investigators said on Tuesday they have opened a probe into 30 million vehicles built by nearly two dozen automakers that have potentially defective Takata air bag inflators.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an engineering analysis into an estimated 30 million U.S. vehicles from the 2001 through 2019 model years, Reuters first reported on Sunday, citing a document that had not been made public. The agency confirmed the new probe on Tuesday and said it applied to 1,384 different vehicle models.
No immediate safety risk has been identified and drivers do not need to take action, the agency said. 
Over the last decade, more than 67 million Takata air bag inflators have been recalled in the United States and more than 100 million worldwide, in the biggest auto safety callback in history prompted by concerns the inflators could explode and, in rare instances, send deadly metal fragments flying.
There have been at least 28 deaths worldwide, including 19 in the United States tied to faulty Takata inflators, and more than 400 injuries.
The new investigation includes vehicles assembled by Honda Motor Co, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE), Nissan Motor, Mazda,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW Chrysler (now part of Stellantis NV), Porsche Cars, Jaguar Land Rover (owned by  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM)), among others.
NHTSA said in an emailed statement that ""while no present safety risk has been identified, further work is needed to evaluate the future risk of non-recalled"" inflators. 
The agency added it ""is not aware at this time of any ruptures, injuries or fatalities due to propellant degradation in these inflators, and the driving public does not need to take any action.""
The 30 million vehicles that are part of the new investigation have inflators with a ""desiccant"" or drying agent. 
NHTSA has said the prior Takata recalls were spurred by propellant that could break down after long-term exposure to high-temperature fluctuations and humidity. The agency has required all similar Takata airbags without a drying agent to be recalled.
Automakers affected by the probe either said they were cooperating with the agency or did not immediately comment.
Honda said automakers ""have been working collaboratively with NHTSA to assure the safety of these inflators for several years... Honda is committed to quickly informing NHTSA and other stakeholders if this ongoing analysis shows any risk of rupture.""

The Japanese automaker vowed to take quick action ""if Honda believes that there is a threat to the safety of our customers. 
In the United States, 16 deaths in Honda vehicles have been reported, two in Ford vehicles and one in a BMW, while 9 other Honda deaths occurred in Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico.

The main equity indices sold off aggressively Monday, weighed by concerns about contagion from Chinese property giant China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt crisis, political difficulties surrounding the passing of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda and lingering Covid-19 issues - not to mention the Fed meeting.
The U.S. central bank’s policy-setting meeting starts later Tuesday, and markets will be looking for more information about plans for reining in its pandemic-era bond-buying program, the quarterly economic forecasts and the so-called dot plot, which the Fed uses to signal its outlook for the path of interest rates.
“ It is quite a close call, but we do not expect the Median Dot Plot for the first rate hike to shift from 2023 to 2022,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
In corporate news, Uber (NYSE:UBER) will be in the spotlight after a company executive said it will make an adjusted profit for the first time in the third quarter, an improvement on its previous guidance.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",How India flipped its vaccine fortunes,"By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Only months ago, India ran so short of COVID-19 vaccines that computer experts wrote software code https://www.reuters.com/world/india/high-tech-hunt-scarce-covid-19-vaccines-india-raises-fear-fairness-2021-05-05 to help people snag scarce immunisation slots and the then health minister had to constantly battle opposition criticism on social media.
The minister later quit and in came a little-known but hands-on politician, Mansukh Mandaviya, who, according to a person close to him, communicates with vaccine producers on a near daily basis and tries to resolve their problems promptly.
Vaccine supplies have surged. 
Government officials say they are confident of fully immunizing nearly all adults by December, giving it the confidence to announce a gradual restart of vaccine exports in the October quarter, for the first time since April when a second surge in infections overwhelmed hospitals.
That will help the sputtering global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, which is far behind its pledge to deliver 2 billion doses this year following supply problems and India's export curbs.
The GAVI vaccine alliance, which sponsors the programme along with the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the CEPI, this month cut COVAX's supply target by nearly 30% to 1.425 billion doses.
""This could have an immense positive impact on both health security within India as well as globally,"" a GAVI spokesperson told Reuters about the export announcement on Monday.
""Our priority right now is to engage with the government of India and Serum Institute of India (SII) to understand the impact this will have on our supply schedule."" 
The turnaround is chiefly thanks to the SII, which is cranking up more doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shot than the government's most optimistic projection.
SII would supply 200 million doses of the vaccine, branded Covishield, to the government this month, compared with about 150 million the previous month, said a government source who declined to be identified.
NEW PRODUCTION LINES 
The government said in May that Covishield output could reach 750 million doses between August and December, but the actual output could be more than 900 million, said two other sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
""The company added new lines, got quick approvals to divert a line meant for some other vaccine,"" said one of the sources.
It now has five production lines making Covishield, up from just two in April, according to the source. The person said SII's monthly output could go as high as 215 million doses.
The health ministry and SII did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bharat Biotech, the producer of India's first domestically developed shot, Covaxin, told Reuters its monthly output would nearly treble to 100 million doses by the end of the year.
SII also received funding and diplomatic help from the government that ensured supplies of raw material https://www.reuters.com/world/india/us-provide-vaccine-components-medical-supplies-india-2021-04-25 from the United States following a plea https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-vaccine-giant-sii-warns-supply-hit-us-raw-materials-export-ban-2021-03-05 on social media and elsewhere.
That enabled India, which has reported the most number of infections in the world after the United States, to ramp up its vaccination campaign, giving at least one dose to 65% of its 944 million adults and the necessary two doses to 22%.
Health Minister Mandaviya told reporters on Monday that he expected overall domestic vaccine production to exceed 1 billion doses in the October-December quarter, which would be more than enough to meet domestic demand.

India is the world's biggest vaccine maker and its companies including SII, Bharat Biotech and Biological E, which does bottling work for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 shot, have trebled their capacity to make nearly 3 billion doses a year, much of which could be available for overseas sale from next year.
""We will keep producing more to meet our needs and also export,"" Mandaviya said.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>","Reserve manager interest in European bonds growing, say bankers","LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign central banks and reserve managers are showing growing interest in new debt issued by the European Union and other pan-European bodies, in a positive sign for the euro's international role, speakers told a virtual financial conference on Tuesday.
The EU is selling bonds to finance a fund worth up to 800 billion euros ($939 billion) to aid the post-COVID 19 recovery.
The fund's temporary nature means there is still no permanent Europe-wide asset rivalling U.S. Treasuries to boost the euro's role as an international reserve currency.
But bankers and other speakers at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) said EU debt sales were drawing strong demand from central banks and reserve managers, particularly in Asia. 
""We've seen massive interest from Asian investors, we've seen interest from reserve managers for the euro reserves and we have not seen any cannibalisation of any sovereign issuance,"" Georges Elhedery, group managing director and co-chief executive officer of global banking and markets at HSBC, told a panel.
Niall Bohan, a director of the European Commission's budget directorate, said this kind of demand was more important than the level of overall orders EU bonds had received.
Kalin Anev Janse, chief financial officer and member of the management board of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), said bonds issued by his institutions were also seeing strong foreign demand.
""In 2020, we had the most Asian investors ever outside of the euro area. We had investors from around the globe, we had central banks, more and more coming into the euro and actually seeing the euro as a stronger alternative to the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency,"" he told the panel. 
Anev Janse estimated that the value of European safe assets issued would reach 2 trillion euros in coming years, a move he said was ""appealing to reserve managers globally"".
Pablo de Ramon-Laca Clausen, director general of the Spanish Treasury, said the EU recovery fund ""could become permanent if it is seen as useful"", adding that many investors wanted the euro to become a stronger reserve currency.

Christian Kopf, chief investment officer for fixed income and foreign exchange at Union Investment, said he believed that positive sentiment among investors towards the recovery fund was leading to some reallocation in favour of some European assets.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's plan to tighten rules on its fast-growing e-commerce market has run into internal government dissent, memos reviewed by Reuters show, with the Ministry of Finance describing some proposals as ""excessive"" and ""without economic rationale"".
The memos offer a rare glimpse of high-stakes policy-making governing a market already featuring global retail heavyweights from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Walmart (NYSE:WMT), plus domestic players like Reliance Industries and Tata Group. The sector is forecast by Grant Thornton to be worth $188 billion by 2025. 
It's not clear how the objections from the finance ministry - a dozen in total - will ultimately be reflected in the proposed rule changes, first floated in June https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-plans-tighter-e-commerce-rules-amid-complaints-over-amazon-flipkart-2021-06-21. But watchers of the influential government arm say its complaints won't fall on deaf ears in the upper echelons of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration.
""The ministry of finance raising such concerns would likely spur a rethink of the policy,"" said Suhaan Mukerji, managing partner at India's PLR Chambers, a law firm that specialises in public policy issues.
India in June shocked the e-commerce world with proposals from its consumer affairs ministry that sought to limit 'flash sales', rein in a push to promote private-label brands and raise scrutiny of relationships between online marketplace operators and their vendors. There is not yet a formal implementation timeline for the new rules.
Though the rules were announced after complaints from brick-and-mortar retailers about alleged unfair practices of foreign companies, they also drew protest from Tata Group, with more than $100 billion in revenue https://reut.rs/3hQinGB, which is planning an e-commerce expansion.
But the finance ministry, the ministry of corporate affairs and the federal think-tank NITI Aayog - an active player in policy-making - have all raised objections in memos reviewed by Reuters, saying the proposals go far beyond their stated aim of protecting consumers and also lack regulatory clarity.
An Aug. 31 memo from the Finance Ministry's Department of Economic Affairs said the rules appeared ""excessive"" and would hit a sector that could boost job creation as well as tax revenue.
""The proposed amendments are likely to have significant implications/restrictions on a sunrise sector and 'ease of doing business',"" said the three-page memo. ""Care needs to be taken to ensure that the proposed measures remain 'light-touch regulations'.""
The finance ministry did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
A spokesman for India's consumer affairs ministry said in a statement that ""internal discussions among various stakeholders including government agencies is (a) sign of mature and healthy decision making process in a democracy."" 
'UNPREDICTABILITY' IN POLICY-MAKING
Voicing its own objections on July 6, NITI Aayog's vice chairman, Rajiv Kumar, wrote to Piyush Goyal, who is minister for commerce as well as consumer affairs minister, saying the rules could hit small businesses.
""Moreover, they send the message of unpredictability and inconsistency in our policy-making,"" Kumar wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. 
Minister Goyal and NITI Aayog's Kumar did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The arguments put forth by the finance ministry and NITI Aayog are in line with concerns raised by sector operators, and even the U.S. government https://reut.rs/2n6rBoM. They say New Delhi has in recent years changed e-commerce policies too often and taken a hard-line regulatory approach that especially hurts American players.
But Indian consumer affairs minister Goyal https://reut.rs/39lsazN and brick-and-mortar retailers disagree and have repeatedly said big U.S. firms have bypassed Indian laws https://reut.rs/3EBODqI and their practices hurt small retailers.
The consumer affairs ministry has said the new rules were aimed to ""further strengthen the regulatory framework"" and were issued after complaints of ""widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in the e-commerce ecosystem."" 
Its statement said a large number of state governments, industry bodies, e-commerce companies and others have supported the regulations and the ministry wants to have the best workable rules for consumers and business.
FLASH SALES, REGULATORY OVERLAP
But the proposals have met with resistance in more than one ministry.
In a July 22 memo, the corporate affairs ministry objected to one proposed clause to be enshrined in new rules that says e-commerce firms should not abuse their dominant position in India. The ministry said the provision was ""unnecessary and superfluous"", and that the subject was best handled by India's antitrust watchdog.
""It is undesirable to introduce a mini-competition law regime in the consumer"" rules, said the memo. The corporate affairs ministry did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The finance ministry has taken a much harder stance on the proposals and raised a total of 12 objections.
Among them, it said, a proposal that makes online shopping websites liable for its sellers' mistakes would be a ""huge dampener"" and could force companies ""to revisit their basic business models"".

It also lodged a protest against the banning of flash sales, which see deep discounts on offer on websites like Amazon and are popular during festive seasons. 
""This is a normal trade practice. The proposed restriction ... seems without economic rationale,"" the ministry wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus has appointed SAP executive Brian Duffy as a senior adviser in its technology team as it bets on the digital transformation of its portfolio companies while also scouting for new tech targets.
The U.S. firm, known as a ""growth investor"" as it deploys cash to support companies that offer strong earnings potential in industries that have profited from the COVID-19 pandemic, has heavily invested in the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector since the start of the pandemic and will rely on Duffy's expertise to identify new investment opportunities globally.
Duffy will be based in Chicago where he will continue working with SAP as ""president of cloud"" overseeing the strategy to drive more customers to cloud computing.
Warburg Pincus' managing director Flavio Porciani said in a statement the firm wanted to provide its ""current and prospective portfolio companies and their management teams with access to industry leaders and deep sector expertise,"" stressing Duffy's track record in promoting digital transformation.
Duffy, who has spent 16 years at SAP in various roles including head of its global strategic initiatives, will work closely with Warburg Pincus' European tech team, which recently worked on a 5.1 billion euro deal to take control of Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s Dutch unit, T-Mobile Netherlands, as part of a consortium with Apax.
The 41-year-old Irishman will frequently travel to Europe where Warburg Pincus' regional co-heads, Adarsh Sarma in London and René Obermann in Berlin, both have a technology background and remain hungry for sector expansion.
Warburg Pincus has invested more than $24 billion in technology businesses since it was founded in 1966. 

In 2020, it clinched deals for Norwegian software firm Visma and Britain's Community Fibre, while earlier this year, it backed Israeli fintech firm Personetics Technologies and analytics software firm Quantexa.
The New York-based company is in the early stages of raising $16 billion from investors for its latest flagship private equity fund, its biggest ever, sources told Reuters.

Investing.com – Universal Music stock climbed 43% on its first day as a listed company after being spun off by French media giant  Vivendi  (OTC:VIVHY).
The shares jumped to 26.45 euro (around $31) from their reference price of 18.50 euro on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange, giving the company a valuation of around 46 billion euro. This also made it Europe’s largest listing yet this year.  
UMG is one of three major labels who control the rights to most of the world's best-known music acts, with its back catalog boasting iconic artists like Bob Dylan and The Beatles. It’s also behind today’s household names like Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.
The listing follows Vivendi's (PA:VIV) decision to distribute 60% of UMG shares to shareholders of the parent company.
UMG accounts for around 75% of Vivendi’s profits. Vivendi now owns only a 10% stake in UMG while billionaire William Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square also owns around as much. China’s Tencent owns around 20%.
The spin off is a landmark in the recovery of the global music publishing business, which went into a long, piracy-driven decline at the start of the digital age. The rise of the streaming model has now comprehensively reversed that decline."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA will make its case at a U.S. trial beginning on Tuesday that it is not liable for nearly $150 million in debts owed to a unit of Siemens Energy because U.S. sanctions prevented it from making payments. 
In January 2017, cash-strapped PDVSA issued a promissory note to oilfield equipment provider Dresser-Rand for some $120 million, plus interest. PDVSA made the first two payments of around $4 million, but defaulted after Washington in August 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-venezuela-sanctions/trump-slaps-sanctions-on-venezuela-maduro-sees-effort-to-force-default-idUSKCN1B5216 issued sanctions preventing trade in the company's new debt. 
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in May 2020 entered a $149.5 million judgment in Dresser-Rand's favor. 
PDVSA, in a bench trial before U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton, will present evidence it says shows attempts to pay were blocked by banks wary of sanctions. It wants the judge to find it is no longer obligated for the debt.
""Sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on PDVSA ... made it impossible or objectively impracticable for PDVSA to make the requisite payments,"" attorneys for PDVSA wrote in a pre-trial brief filed on March 29.
The case shows how the PDVSA sanctions, which Washington says are meant to press socialist President Nicolas Maduro to restore democracy, have had far-reaching unintended consequences. Companies often decline to engage in even U.S.-approved transactions with PDVSA out of an abundance of caution. 

Dresser-Rand will try to show that an exemption to the sanctions meant PDVSA's payments would have been allowed, and that the company offered alternative options after a  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) unit declined to process the payments, its pre-trial brief shows. 
PDVSA has sought to compel Dresser-Rand to hand over communications with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces sanctions, to try to prove the exemption did not apply.

PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) on Tuesday reported a sharp rise in first-half profit, in another sign that mounting commodity prices and strong demand for staple crops are boosting earnings for international merchants.
The improved results further ease financial pressure on LDC after it completed this month the sale of a stake to Abu Dhabi holding firm ADQ, heralding the first non-family shareholder in the agricultural commodity group's 170-year history.
Group net profit reached $336 million, up 167% from $126 million a year earlier, partly due to a reduced tax bill linked to currency effects, LDC said in a statement https://www.ldc.com/press-releases/louis-dreyfus-company-b-v-reports-robust-2021-half-year-consolidated-financial-results.
Core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 23% to $778 million.
A surge in commodity prices and strong grain demand from China have supported earnings for agricultural merchants during the coronavirus pandemic, and helped LDC's profits to recover last year.
An economic rebound, as countries have eased restrictions to curb COVID-19, has also revived demand for textiles and crop-based biofuel.
LDC said an upturn in cotton and biofuel contributed to a 4.2% increase in its shipped volumes in the first half.
Among its other products, grains and oilseeds continued to perform strongly while rice sustained favourable margins despite higher freight rates and logistics constraints, LDC said.
Citing ""a persistently volatile environment"", Chief Executive Michael Gelchie said LDC's market knowledge, risk management and hedging strategies led to ""solid results for the first half of the year.""
LDC, known as Dreyfus, is the ""D"" of the ""ABCD"" quartet of renowned global agricultural commodity firms alongside Archer- Daniels-Midland Co,  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd and Cargill Inc.
LDC has sold a 45% indirect stake to ADQ, concluding a long hunt for an investor by controlling shareholder and chairwoman Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who had built up debt buying out other family members during a period of lean profits.
The ADQ deal has allowed LDC's parent company to repay $1 billion borrowed from its operating group, a debt relating to Brazilian sugar firm Biosev that was previously owned by LDC's parent.
LDC's group equity as of June 30 rose to $5 billion from $4.9 billion at the end of 2020, with first-half net income partly offset by a $191 million dividend paid to shareholders, the group's results showed.

LONDON (Reuters) -British home improvement retailer  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) reported a 62% jump in first-half profit as it rode a do-it-yourself (DIY) boom during the pandemic but concerns over inflation and product availability pushed its shares down almost 5%.
The group, which owns B&Q and Screwfix in the United Kingdom and Castorama and Brico Depot in France and other markets, said it was seeing higher than normal cost price inflation arising from certain raw materials and freight costs.
""We expect inflationary pressures to persist through H2 as higher cost inventory is sold through but as demonstrated in H1 we are committed to maintaining our strong competitive price position,"" CEO Thierry Garnier told reporters on Tuesday.
He said that despite supply chain disruption the group's product availability is currently above where it was in January. However, stocks of timber, cement and some products containing semiconductor chips were still below target levels. 
Shares in Kingfisher were down 4.9% at 0950 GMT, paring 2021 gains to under 30%, reflecting concern over the inflationary and availability outlook.
Separately on Tuesday British building materials supplier SIG warned an industry-wide shortage of materials will likely continue this year. 
Kingfisher made an adjusted pretax profit of 669 million pounds ($914.3 million) for the six months ended July 31, beating guidance and the 415 million pounds made a year earlier.
Many people have discovered or rediscovered DIY during the COVID-19 crisis as they were forced to spend more time at home.
Kingfisher's sales rose 22.2% on a constant currency basis to 7.1 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales up 22.8%.
The group said it had made a good start to its second half, with resilient demand across all markets, though third quarter to Sept. 18 like-for-like sales were down 0.6% reflecting high numbers a year ago.
Kingfisher raised its second half outlook, forecasting like-for-like sales down 7% to 3% versus previous guidance of down 15% to 5%.
It forecast a 2021-22 adjusted pretax profit of 910-950 million pounds, up from 786 million in 2020-21.
The group also declared an interim dividend of 3.8 pence, up 38%, and plans to return 300 million pounds to shareholders through a share buyback.
Garnier said he had addressed many of Kingfisher's past issues with ""fixes"" now complete in the UK and Poland and positive results in France from a strategy to repair ranges.

The group plans to accelerate Screwfix's expansion in the UK and Ireland, targeting over 1,000 stores from 900 previously, and will open its first Screwfix stores in France in 2022. It also plans to accelerate the expansion of Castorama Poland.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Universal Music solo project proves a hit with investors,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Universal Music Group's shares leapt more than a third in their stock market debut on Tuesday as investors bet a boom in music streaming still has a long way to run.
Here are facts about Universal and its flotation: 
FROM THE BEATLES TO BILLIE EILISH
By revenue, Universal Music Group or UMG is the largest of the ""big three"" record labels. It represents a huge range of musicians and song catalogues, from Billie Eilish to The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. 
Major competitors include  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music, part of Sony, and Warner Music Group. The ""big three"" are estimated to account for just under 60% of global sales generated by music rights from their catalogues. 
Universal started out in the early 1930s when British label Decca Records set up a U.S. branch, which later merged with other music companies. In 2011 Universal swooped on EMI's recorded music business for $1.9 billion, giving it access to catalogues for The Beatles, Radiohead and Pink Floyd. 
A SHIFTING MUSIC INDUSTRY
Universal is benefiting from a boom in streaming revenues, with young music fans in particular relying on their smartphones to listen to songs. It makes money from subscription services through deals with the likes of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
It also has deals in place with ad-based social media companies such as TikTok and YouTube to compensate artists for the use of their songs in ""user-generated content"" on those platforms - though the terms of those deals are not public.
While digital piracy cut into music sales in the first decade of the century, Universal is now pushing into areas such as social media platforms which use its music, such as TikTok, as well as fitness applications and video games. 
Universal still faces competition from independent labels and startups looking to release music in a purely digital fashion. The company said in its listing prospectus that it expected to grow its streaming business in markets such as South Korea, Brazil, India and Russia. 
THE LISTING
Universal was spun off by French media group Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY). Vivendi's investors, including its controlling shareholder Vincent Bollore, received 60% of the shares of Universal after it listed in Amsterdam.
Universal saw its market value leap to almost 47 billion euros ($55 billion) on Tuesday in Europe's largest listing of the year. 
Vivendi will continue to hold 10% of Universal after the transaction. A consortium led by China's Tencent will have 20% and billionaire hedge fund investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings will hold 10%. 
Bollore and Tencent have agreed to consult each other on matters such as dividend policy and some aspects of the board ahead of general meetings, Universal said in its prospectus. 
REVENUES AND COVID-19 IMPACT
Universal reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.49 billion euros on sales of 7.43 billion euros in 2020. The company has 2 billion euros of net debt.

For the mid-term, Universal forecasts sales growth in the high single digits, with an EBITDA margin in the mid 20% range.

Investors and environmentalists have been critical of South African banks for not doing enough to meet sustainability targets and being easy on funding to fossil fuel based projects. 
Under pressure, the top four banks in the country have taken measures such as reducing funding for coal and increasing exposure to renewable and environmentally sustainable projects.
""By achieving pre-agreed sustainability performance targets, Mediclinic Southern Africa will benefit from a reduced facility margin through an incentive-based pricing mechanism,"" the country's third biggest hospital chain operator said. 
The targets are directly linked to key group environmental and social goals of progressing to becoming carbon neutral with zero waste to landfill by 2030, it said. 
RMB, a division of FirstRand Ltd, said the loan was Africa' first syndicated sustainability-linked loan arranged by a bank in Africa.
South Africa's FirstRand, among the country's top banks, said last week that it will end funding for new coal-fired power stations and coal mines as part of its initiative to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
It is among the two top banks out of four in the country to have explicitly announced a halt to fossil fuel-based funding.

Nedbank Group had said in April it would stop funding new thermal coal mines by 2025 as it plans to phase out fossil fuel exposure over the next 24 years.

Despite the slightly reduced borrowing needs at the end of the year, overall 2021 debt issuance will reach a record high of some 482 billion euros, the agency said.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has asked parliament to suspend the debt brake in the constitution for the second year in a row, allowing net new debt of up to 240 billion euros in 2021 to finance emergency measures in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Investing.com – Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) ADRs (NYSE:RDSa) traded 4% higher in premarket Tuesday on the energy giant’s plans to return to shareholders a large part of the cash it will get from the sale of Permian assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).
Under the deal announced by the companies Monday, Shell has agreed to sell all its assets in the Permian basin, the most active U.S. oil field, to ConocoPhillips for around $9.5 billion. Of this, Shell plans to return to shareholders $7 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks. This will be in addition to the 20%-30% of cash flow from operations the company plans to return to its shareholders on a routine basis.
The remaining cash will be used to strengthen the balance sheet, the company said.
The deal is part of the broader industry-wide shift towards cleaner energy, which is forcing Shell to focus on its most profitable high-carbon businesses and grow a portfolio of lower-carbon assets. Just last week, Shell announced plans to build one of Europe’s biggest biofuels facilities, a 820,000-ton per year unit in the Netherlands.
Shell's exit from the Permian is a recognition that it cost too much to expand its presence there to optimal scale. 
The deal with ConocoPhillips overshadowed the other announcement Shell made on Monday, with respect to operations at its West Delta platform in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the company, Hurricane Ida has inflicted significant structural damage to its offshore facilities. The WD-143 ‘A’ platform facilities will be offline for repairs until the end of 2021, and the facilities on WD-143 ‘C’ platform will be operational only in the fourth quarter of the current financial year, according to the company.
At this stage, the company said around 60% of its production in the Gulf of Mexico is back online."

After a harrowing Monday that saw risky assets tumble globally on fears of a collapse in China Evergrande Group, some of the world’s biggest banks and money managers raced to assure investors that this is no Lehman moment.
The message from firms including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Fidelity International Ltd. and AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) Holding LP: Evergrande may indeed default, but Chinese authorities will take steps to prevent the company’s crisis from destabilizing the financial system and economy. 
Gains in S&P 500 Index futures on Tuesday suggest investor angst has subsided, at least for now. 
Here’s a sampling of what strategists and money managers are saying about the prospect of contagion:
Ajay Rajadhyaksha,  Barclays  (LON:BARC)
So, is this China’s Lehman moment? Not even close, in our opinion.
Yes, Evergrande is a large property firm. And yes, there could (probably will) be spill-over effects on China’s property sector, with economic implications. And yes, it comes at a time when China’s growth has already started to disappoint. But a true ‘Lehman moment’ is a crisis of a very different magnitude. One would need to see a lenders’ strike across large parts of the financial system, a sharp increase in credit distress away from the real-estate sector, and banks being unwilling to face each other in the interbank funding market. And with all that, we would also need to see massive policy mistakes on the part of Chinese authorities. In our view, the conditions are simply not in place for even a large default to be China’s Lehman moment.
Judy Zhang, Citigroup
We do not see the Evergrande crisis as China’s Lehman moment given policy makers will likely uphold the bottom line of preventing systematic risk to buy time for resolving the debt risk, and push forward marginal easing for the overall credit environment.
We believe regulators may buy time to digest Evergrande’s NPL problem (e.g., guiding banks not to withdraw credit and extend interest payment deadline).
Kenneth Akintewe, Aberdeen Standard Invest Asia 
Our base case is that there will be a relatively orderly restructuring, it’s not in the interest of policy makers, economy or the market to go into a destabilized uncontrollable spillover, and have this impacting other parts of the economy.
Near term there will be uncertainty and volatility, but outside of Evergrande, policy makers will be able to engineer some sort of recovery from this.
Bhanu Baweja, UBS
I don’t think this is a Lehman moment. I think when you try to reduce moral hazard after four major credit cycles, it is going to be messy. The biggest risk out here is not what happens to suppliers or what happens to the financial system in the near term, I don’t think that’s an issue. I think China has managed that reasonably well. Default levels are pretty low in the overall economy and the capital adequacy for banks, particularly the large banks, is quite high.
I think the most important issue is what this does to the collateral of the entire credit boom -- which is property prices -- and therefore confidence in property itself. 
Catherine Yeung, Fidelity International
If we look at the past three years, we have seen restructuring that the government or regulators have been involved in, whether it’s Huarong, China Fortune Land, and other single credit events. So they have the confidence in terms of this potential restructuring. 
The likely scenario is that they will avoid bankruptcy when it comes to Evergrande [and] seek restructuring with strategic investors or bridge investors. The priority from a domestic perspective and a sentiment perspective is projection completion and supply chain cash settlements.
Vishwanath Tirupattur,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
The expectations of a broad contagion may be overdone. Clearly the impact on growth is there. But I think the key point here is I continue to believe this is not a moment like what we had in 2008. There has certainly been a subtle change of signal from the policy makers in China. A lot of that we think is already reflected in price.

[The market sell-off] is primarily driven by technical selling flows (CTAs and option hedgers) in an environment of poor liquidity, and overreaction of discretionary traders to perceived risks. Our fundamental thesis remains unchanged, and we see the sell-off as an opportunity to buy the dip.
Risks are well-flagged and priced in, with stock multiples back at post-pandemic lows for many reopening/recovery exposures. We look for cyclicals to resume leadership as delta inflects.
Shujin Chen, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) 
Against the market view, we see regulators keeping a close eye on Evergrande and think it could soon put forward a plan or meaningful progress to reduce the impact.
We expect a plan to resolve the issues, or help make meaningful progress to be out by the end of the year (also possible within 1-2 months) as China will focus on boosting 1Q22 economic growth starting from 4Q21.
Larry Hu, Macquarie
A major concern is the contagion risk for other high-leveraged developers, as banks, suppliers and homebuyers would all turn more cautious in view of the Evergrande saga. As the result, a self-fulfilled liquidity crunch could happen to other high-leveraged developers. That said, the government has the will and capability to intervene, if the market goes panic. 
It could break the negative feedback loop by easing liquidity, as what it did during the interbank credit crunch in 2013. Moreover, given property policy is unprecedentedly tight at this moment, policy makers have plenty of room to loosen if they want. It seems that they are willing to wait a bit longer to reduce the moral hazard in the future, but they could step in anytime for the sake of financial and social stability.
John Lin, AllianceBernstein
There is very little likelihood of default spilling over into a systematic crisis. First, Chinese regulators are the ones triggering the most recent fall of Evergrande.  The regulators have prepared for it, and they will be able to manage through it.
Because there is low likelihood of a systematic crisis, many of the Chinese developers – particularly the higher quality companies with strong balance sheet, capable management and good product reputation – will survive this round of correction.  In the market panic over the last two weeks, their valuations have already overshot on the down side.  In our opinion, these select quality developers present compelling return opportunities for long-term minded investors.
Tommy Wu, Oxford Economics
Concerns over the rising default risk of Evergrande, the property developer, have roiled financial markets over the last week. While we think the government doesn’t want to be seen as engineering a bail out, we expect it to step in to conduct a managed restructuring of the firm’s debt to prevent disorderly debt recovery efforts, reduce systemic risk, and contain economic disruption."
657,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>",Shell exits Permian with $9.5 billion Texas shale sale to ConocoPhillips,"By David French and Jessica Resnick-Ault
(Reuters) -Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Monday it would sell its Permian Basin assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for $9.5 billion in cash, an exit from the largest U.S. oilfield for the energy major shifting its focus to the clean energy transition.
For ConocoPhillips, it is the second sizable acquisition in a year in the heart of the U.S. shale industry, as American and European producers diverge in whether to focus on hydrocarbons going forward.
Like all of the world's largest oil companies, Shell is under pressure from investors to reduce fossil-fuel investments to help reduce global carbon emissions and fight climate change.
Europeans such as Shell and BP (NYSE:BP) PLC have set targets to slowly move away from crude production while investing in non-fossil energy sources like solar and wind power, while U.S. producers including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) are doubling down on hydrocarbons.
Through the deal, ConocoPhillips sides with the latter, but concurrently announced it would tighten its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, an acknowledgement of heightened focus on climate considerations.
ConocoPhillips is acquiring around 225,000 net acres, as well as over 600 miles of associated infrastructure, according to its statement announcing the transaction. This builds on its existing portfolio of 750,000 net acres in the Permian.
U.S. shale producers have used mergers and acquisitions to boost their size to compete against the largest operators and lower production costs through economies of scale.
To help pay for the deal, ConocoPhillips will hike its own divestment targets by 2023 to between $4 billion and $5 billion, up from between $2 billion and $3 billion.
VALUE
For Shell, selling the Permian assets will leave its U.S. oil and gas production almost entirely in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, where it is the largest single producer. It sold its Appalachian gas assets last year.
The sale was announced on the same day Shell disclosed damage to offshore transfer facilities from Hurricane Ida will cut production from the area into early next year.
""We have had a once in a 20-30 year storm that has been impactful, but we continue to believe this is a very valuable position,"" Wael Sawan, the company's director of upstream, told Reuters.
Sawan said the company would continue to invest in its top oil and gas assets globally, and while it had looked at options which would have retained and boosted its Permian acreage in recent years, it was decided the position did not have sufficient scale for Shell to continue to operate it.
""This sale came up for us as a very compelling value proposition,"" Sawan said.
U.S. will continue to account for around one-third of Shell's global spending, as it focuses on its Gulf position as well as petrochemicals and renewables.
Shell will return $7 billion of the proceeds to shareholders as dividends on top of existing commitments, with the rest going to pay down debt, it said. Conoco also announced it would increase quarterly cash payments to shareholders by 7% from Dec. 1.

Reuters first reported in June that Shell had put up for sale its assets in the Permian, the shale formation stretching across Texas and New Mexico that accounts for around 40% of U.S. oil production.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co advised Shell, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) supporting ConocoPhillips. Legal advice for the seller and buyer came from Norton Rose Fulbright and Baker Botts respectively.

(Reuters) -Building materials supplier SIG on Tuesday predicted its annual earnings would top expectations but joined other British companies in warning that severe supply constraints will likely persist for several months.
SIG, which sells roofing and insulation materials in Britain and a handful of European countries, said trading was ""solid"" during July-August despite the supply disruptions, which are being worsened by a shortage of truck drivers.
The Sheffield-based company said it expected full-year underlying operating profit above prior expectations, provided current supply constraints do not worsen.
Shares in SIG were 1.6% higher at 50.65 pence by 0835 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) raised their estimates for SIG's 2021 profit to 32 million pounds ($43.8 million) from 25 million, predicting stronger profit margins from France and Germany. SIG had reported a loss of 43.2 million pounds in 2020.
Globally, businesses across industries have been hit by supply bottlenecks at ports and warehouses and a raft of companies in Britain have said the issues are leading to higher costs and could weigh on earnings.
Home improvement retailer  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) warned on Tuesday its suppliers were challenged by high order levels, and flagged supply issues at its building materials and outdoor ranges businesses.
SIG posted an underlying operating profit of 13.6 million pounds for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss a year earlier.

Investing.com - European stock markets bounced Tuesday, helped by a strong debut from Universal Music Group, while the Federal Reserve's policy meeting continues to dominate thinking.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% higher, rebounding from its lowest level since late July, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.4% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%.
European equities pushed higher Tuesday, rebounding after a poor start to the week, with most sectors in demand, including the mining and energy stocks which were hard hit on Monday.
Universal Music Group, the company behind successful singers such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, soared more than 35% above its reference price in its first day of trading after the largest listing in Europe so far this year.
U.K. transport company Stagecoach (LON:SGC) stock soared 17% after the news  National Express  (LON:NEX), up 3.9%, was in talks to acquire its rival operator in an all-share deal, opening up potential cost savings and new growth opportunities.
On the flip side,  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) stock fell over 5% despite the U.K. home improvement retailer reporting a sizable jump in first-half profit and raising its sales expectations for the second half.  The company warned of continuing Covid-related uncertainty and said problems in sourcing shipping containers would likely extend into 2022.
However, the main focus Tuesday will be on the Federal Reserve, with the U.S. central bank starting its two-day meeting. Most expect the Fed to give a strong signal that it will start running down its bond purchases before year end, while there is more doubt about whether the central bank's so-called 'dot plot' will shift to reflect expectations of earlier rate hikes.
There also remain concerns of a disorderly default in property giant China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) Group, potentially hurting China's property and financial sectors at a time when growth in the world's second-largest economy is already slowing.
Evergrande has an $83.5 million interest payment for its March 2022 bond due on Thursday and a second $47.5 million interest payment due on Sep. 29 for its March 2024 notes, and a grace period of 30 days on both. It has already missed a small payment to bank creditors. 
Crude prices also rebounded Tuesday, advancing after days of losses after indications that disruptions to crude output in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico will last into next year.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), the biggest oil producer in the region, said Monday that production from two of its largest fields there will not resume until 2022 given the damage caused by Hurricane Ida in late August. Shell stock rose 3.3% on Monday's news that it will sell its Permian assets to ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) for $9.5 billlion, returning $7 billion of the proceeds to shareholders.
Investors will now focus on crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute later in the session for more information.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $71.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $74.92. Both contracts slumped around 2% last session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,760.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1728.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>","Evergrande woes hit Japan's toilet, air-conditioner and paint manufacturers","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Concern that China Evergrande may default https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-fears-consume-investors-awaiting-trading-2021-09-21 on its mountain of debt hit shares of toilet maker Toto and other Japanese firms that are seen vulnerable to a further slowdown in China's property development.
Toto lost 6.1 % on Tuesday, extending its fall since Thursday to 14.8%, on the perceived risk of exposure to Evergrande, which investors fear could miss debt payment later this week.
""There are rising and widely reported concerns about fund flows at leading local developer China Evergrande Group, whose business scale suggests to us it is very likely one of TOTO's major customers,"" said Arisa Katsuyama, analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Year-to-date debt defaults by real estate companies in China, not just China Evergrande, already exceed the cumulative figure for the past 10 years as tighter regulations bite,"" she said, adding investors should bear in mind the risk Toto may have to book loan loss reserves.
China accounted for about 30% of Toto's profit last year but the firm's spokesperson said it could not comment on specific transactions including whether it has deals with Evergrande.
Other potential suppliers to Chinese house builders and constructors were also caught in the melee, with air-conditioner manufacturer Daikin losing 4.7%.
Almost a quarter of Daikin's air-conditioner sales came from China in the last financial year, compared with 13-16% in previous years. 
Paint maker Nippon Paint Holding, for which China is by far the largest market, slid 7.5%. 
Manufacturers of construction machines, which have long benefited from the construction boom in China, also suffered, with Komatsu (OTC:KMTUY) losing 5.4% and Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Construction Machinery shedding 5.5%.
Investors also dumped SoftBank Group, a big investor in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech firms, on fears Beijing will continue to tighten its grip on them.
SoftBank Group shares lost 5.0% as U.S.-listed Alibaba shares hit a two-year low on Monday. 
Tomoichiro Kubota, senior strategist at Matsui Securities, said the damage could spread to more companies if China's slowdown becomes more evident.
""It looks like Chinese authorities are clamping down on outright lavishness, which seems to have support from the Chinese public. That has some resemblance to Japan's post-bubble era, when expensive house prices were considered bad for ordinary people."" 
While many Japanese firms rely on Chinese demand, Japanese institutional investors have relatively limited exposure to Chinese assets.

Japan's biggest investor, Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), had exposure of 9.673 billion yen ($88.31 million) to Evergrande as of March, 5.9 billion yen in bonds and 3.7 billion yen in stocks, out of its 186.1 trillion yen ($1.70 trillion) assets.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - London-based fintech startup TrueLayer said on Tuesday it had raised $130 million from investment firm Tiger Global Management and payments technology provider Stripe in a funding round that valued the company at more than $1 billion.
The company, which last raised $70 million in April, has seen 400% growth in monthly payment volume this year so far, as it expanded across Europe and doubled its customer base.
Founded in 2016, TrueLayer is one of several startups seeking to take advantage of European Union and the UK open banking rules which require lenders to open up their data to other companies so they can tailor products to their customers.
The company operates in 14 European countries and would launch its services in Australia in the coming months, Chief Executive Officer Francesco Simoneschi said in an interview.
TrueLayer, which counts Freetrade, Revolut and Cazoo among its customers, accounts for more than half of all open banking traffic in the UK, Ireland and Spain.

Boeing said on Tuesday that it expects airlines in Europe to order 7,100 new single-aisle planes, usually used for short haul trips, between now and 2040, with low-cost specialists like Ryanair behind that demand. 
In fact, Europe's demand for planes will be even more strongly driven by low-cost carriers than elsewhere in the world, said Boeing vice president, commercial marketing Darren Hulst. 
""Globally our forecast in general is about 40% of single aisle demand is low-cost carrier, and I would say you could argue in this European space that number would be slightly higher,"" he told a press briefing.
In the widebody or long-haul sector, Boeing is expecting demand for 1,545 new jets in Europe over the 20-year period. 
Of the 7,100 new single aisle jets, where Boeing's 737 jets compete against Airbus's A320 and A321s, Hulst is expecting demand for close to 3,000 to come in the next ten years. 
Many traditional carriers like British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Air France-KLM also operate their own low-cost brands, such as Vueling and Transavia respectively.
Ryanair, one of Boeing's biggest customers in Europe, earlier in September abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemaker over a new order of the larger 737 MAX 10 jets, worth tens of billions of dollars, due to differences over price.

But Boeing's Hulst said that Ryanair could always come back if it wanted more. 
""I think we would continue to make sure that the 737 MAX 10 and you know other derivatives of the 737 can help Ryanair change the game even more,"" he said.

Arctos's technology is a potential way to treat inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) and other diseases that involve photoreceptor loss, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
Existing gene therapy treatments aim to correct a specific gene, so only a small number of patients can benefit, Novartis said. The Arctos technology is not limited to a specific gene, and can potentially address many forms of IRDs, it said.
IRDs affect more than 2 million people globally and often result in complete blindness. AMD, meanwhile, affects an estimated 170 million people globally, Novartis said.

The acquisition underscores its commitment to using optogenetics-based therapies to restore vision to patients with advanced blindness, the company said.
""Optogenetics is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach that might restore sight to patients who are legally blind,"" Jay Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, said in a statement.

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) shares continued their downward trend, after S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings warned that the developer is on the brink of default.
Shares slid 3.51% to HK$2.20 ($0.28) by 12:35 AM ET (4:35 AM GMT), after dropping as much as 7% during the previous day’s session.
“We believe Beijing would only be compelled to step in if there is a far-reaching contagion causing multiple major developers to fail and posing systemic risks to the economy,” S&P said in a report dated Sep. 20.
“China Evergrande failing alone would unlikely result in such a scenario.”
The focus is now on whether the company will be able to pay an $83.5 million interest payment for its March 2022 bond due on Thursday. A second $47.5 million interest payment for its March 2024 notes is due on Sep. 29.
Chinese authorities had previously warned major lenders not to expect repayment of interest on bank loans due this week. However, some investors argued that some form of government intervention is inevitable as the crisis deepens.
“While we think the government does not want to be seen as engineering a bailout, we expect it to step in to conduct a managed restructuring of the firm’s debt to prevent disorderly debt recovery efforts, reduce systemic risk, and contain economic disruption,” Oxford Economics lead economist Tommy Wu and head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs said in a note.
However, financial conditions for the broader property sector will remain tense for some time, with some spill-over into wider financial sector stress, the note added."

In an alert to investors, the SEC detailed the potential risks in putting money into U.S.-listed companies that have contracts with but no control over a Chinese entity, known as a variable interest entity (VIE). It is the most recent move by the agency to address concerns that Chinese companies are flouting rules for accessing U.S. markets.
In July, the agency said https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-us-regulator-freezes-chinese-company-ipos-over-risk-disclosures-2021-07-30 it will not allow Chinese companies to raise money in the United States unless they fully explain their legal structures and disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their business. Earlier this year, the agency began rolling out a new law, aimed at China, that would kick foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards.
According to the SEC, these U.S.-listed companies often own a subsidiary in China that was formed to enter into the contractual arrangements with the China-based VIE. The contracts can include powers of attorney, equity pledge agreements, and exclusive services or business cooperation agreements. 

The VIE structure is typically used because of Beijing's restrictions on non-Chinese ownership of companies in key industries in China, the SEC said. In selling shares to U.S. investors, the firms are raising capital from U.S. investors without distributing ownership of those firms to them.
The SEC warned investors that they are exposed to risk if Beijing determines they violate Chinese law, may be subject to Chinese jurisdiction in enforcing any contracts and may be affected by conflicts of interest between the owners of the entity and U.S. shareholders.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Monday began offering a free mobile plan with about one-quarter of its TV shows and movies in Kenya, a strategy aimed at sparking growth in a key African market, the company told Reuters.
The free plan is available on Android mobile phones and will not have ads. It features Netflix movies and TV shows such as dramas ""Money Heist"" and ""Bridgerton"" and African series ""Blood & Water,"" plus some of the programming the company licenses from others. 
Netflix hopes the free plan will lead to users signing up for a paid option with more content. 
The world's largest streaming video service is looking to add customers outside of more saturated markets such as the United States, where new subscriber signups have slowed https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-current-quarter-forecast-misses-estimates-shares-fall-2021-07-20 at a time when competition for online audiences has intensified. 
Executives remain bullish on the long-term future, noting there are large markets where streaming television is just starting to take hold. To attract customers in Africa, Netflix is investing in locally made programming such as ""Queen Sono"" and ""Jiva!"" and has partnered with production studios in Nigeria.
""If you've never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service,"" Cathy Conk, director of product innovation at Netflix, said in a blog post. ""And if you like what you see, it’s easy to upgrade to one of our paid plans so you can enjoy our full catalog on your TV or laptop as well."" 
The free plan started on Monday and will roll out across Kenya in the coming days. 
The non-paying Netflix subscribers in Kenya will not be counted in the paid total the company reports each quarter, a spokesperson said.
Netflix has experimented with free offers before. In 2020, it made some episodes of series such as ""Stranger Things"" and movies including ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" available around the world for no charge via web browsers. 
The free plan in Kenya is broader. It will look similar to paid Netflix profiles to give viewers a feel for the service, the spokesperson said. Shows that are not included in the free plan will be marked with a lock icon. Clicking on one of those titles will encourage the user sign up for a paid option. 
Anyone 18 or older in Kenya can enroll in the free plan and create up to five profiles. No payment information will be required. 
Some functions, such as the ability to download a show or movie, will not be available under the free plan.
Netflix, which streams in more than 190 countries, has taken other steps to boost usage in Africa https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-netflix/netflix-turns-to-telecoms-tie-ups-in-challenging-african-markets-idUSKBN2751FC, including creation of a paid mobile-only plan and partnerships with local telecom operators to ease payments.

The company reported 209 million paying customers worldwide at the end of June. New member pickups slowed in the first half of 2021 after a boom early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Africa currently is a relatively small market for streaming TV subscriptions. Digital TV Research projects Netflix will lead subscription video on demand services on the continent with 6.26 million paying customers in 2026, followed by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+.

""I guess it's the China news but... it's not altogether surprising given how bullish people were.""
Wednesday will bring the results of the Fed's policy meeting, where the central bank is expected to lay the groundwork for a tapering, although the consensus is for an actual announcement to be delayed until the November or December meetings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 614.41 points, or 1.78%, to 33,970.47, the S&P 500 lost 75.26 points, or 1.70%, to 4,357.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 330.07 points, or 2.19%, to 14,713.90.
The Dow registered its biggest daily percentage drop since July, while the CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose.
The S&P 500 is now down about 4% from its Sept. 2 record high close.
Strategists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said they expected a 10% correction in the S&P 500 as the Fed starts to unwind its monetary support, adding that signs of stalling economic growth could deepen it to 20%.
Most airline carriers ended higher after the United States announced it will relax travel restrictions in November on passengers from China, India, Britain and many other European countries who have received COVID-19 vaccines.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 193 new lows.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin and Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell called on the Justice Department and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to coordinate efforts to ""ensure qualifying passenger behavior is criminally prosecuted.""
""Civil penalties alone are failing to deter criminal activity by airline passengers,"" Durbin and Cantwell wrote in the letter to the FAA https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FAA%20Unruly%20Passenger%20Letter%20(Sept.%2020%202021)%20Final%20Signed.pdf.

The letter from Airlines for America said the ""incidents pose a safety and security threat to our passengers and employees, and we respectfully request the (Justice Department) commit to the full and public prosecution of onboard acts of violence.""
To date this year, there have been 4,284 reports of unruly passenger incidents https://www.faa.gov/data_research/passengers_cargo/unruly_passengers/?ipid=post_link_1, including 3,123 that were mask-related. The FAA has initiated enforcement actions in 154 cases, issuing more than $1 million in proposed fines.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson imposed in January a zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on flights around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That policy will extend until at least as long as federal mask rules on airplanes are in place, which were extended last month into mid-January 2022.

""It is critical that DOJ direct federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors to use these authorities to fully investigate reported incidents on aircraft, and, when supported by the evidence, prosecute those who are criminally responsible,"" Durbin and Cantwell's letter to Garland said.

Market indices dropped by over 2% at one point this afternoon due to the potential ripple effects of a default of a major Chinese real estate company. When you add in recent concerns over the passage of fiscal measures and the infrastructure bill, things certainly appear dicey.
While I don't believe we are headed for a market crash, there's no reason for investors to consider less risky stocks in their portfolios. I consider safe or defensive stocks to be less risky due to a number of features. The first is beta. According to Investopedia, beta is a measure of the volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.
So, if a stock has a beta of 1, it has the same volatility as the market. That's why I only want to consider stocks with a beta below 1. In addition, I also want companies that have a consistent history of positive earnings growth and a Buy rating in our POWR Ratings system. Three stocks that fit the bill are Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL), Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX), and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW).

PARIS (Reuters) - In a bid to drum up investor appetite for rough, natural diamonds, mining company Lucara Diamond Corp and manufacturer HB Antwerp on Monday unveiled a 1,175-carat diamond in New York City. 
The companies are billing the stone as the largest rough diamond to be shown in the United States, and the third-largest to be discovered. Reuters could not independently verify these claims. 
HB Antwerp told Reuters it has yet to decide whether the uncut diamond will be cut into polished stones. 
The massive diamond was unveiled at the Whitby Hotel in upper midtown Manhattan, kicking off a week of viewings.
The uncut stone was one of three diamonds of over a thousand carats extracted from the Karowe Mine in Botswana in recent years. In 2020, the two companies teamed up with Louis Vuitton to show the Sewelo diamond, also from the Karowe Mine, with each of the three parties taking ownership.
“We’ve been in the business for many years, for quite some time, and these types of things do get us excited because of the sheer size,” Oded Mansori, chief executive officer of HB Antwerp, told Reuters. He held up a hand, curling his fingers as if holding an egg, to demonstrate its size.

The partners aim to throw the spotlight on the natural state of the stone, at a time when lab-grown diamonds are casting themselves as viable commercial alternatives to real diamonds.
The mining company started using x-ray technology in 2015 to help locate and identify diamonds. ""We do expect that we will recover more exceptional diamonds in excess of a thousand carats in size - but on a global basis, this is still an extremely rare and unusual event,” said Lucara's chief executive, Eira Thomas.

The U.S. housing market has faced labor supply issues over the past several months, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials along with a rise in construction costs, while demand for new homes has been rising.
""During the third quarter, our company and the homebuilding industry as a whole continued to experience unprecedented supply chain challenges which we believe will continue into the foreseeable future,""  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said. 
""The housing market has proven to be strong in the current environment as demand continues to outstrip limited supply.""
Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose in July after three straight monthly declines, but housing market momentum is slowing as surging housing prices amid tight supply sideline some first-time buyers from the market.
Lennar flagged land supply chain challenges due to delays in permit approvals, and said it expects to deliver about 18,000 homes in the fourth quarter, compared with estimates of 20,343 homes, according to Refinitiv data.
Larger rival D.R. Horton Inc  Orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 4.6% to 16,277 homes in the third-quarter, while deliveries increased to 15,199 units from 13,842 units. Average price for homes delivered rose by 8% to $428,000. Excluding mark-to-market gains, Lennar earned $3.27 per share. 
Net earnings attributable to the company rose 111% to $1.41 billion, or $4.52 per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31. Revenue rose 18.2% to $6.94 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $6.87 billion.

Given this, we think that high dividend-yielding stocks  BP  plc. (LON:BP (NYSE:BP)), British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), and Petrobras (PBR) could be good bets now. So, let’s examine these names.The Fed’s anticipated bond tapering is still shrouded with uncertainty, and interest rates are still at near-zero levels. Ten-year Treasury yields have fallen to 1.32% as investors rush to bonds, driven by uncertainties surrounding the equity markets.
Meanwhile, equity dividend payouts have increased substantially in the second quarter and are expected to hit $1.39 trillion in 2021. Thus, amid the declining Treasury yields and heightened stock market volatility with the COVID-19 Delta variant threatening the economic recovery, high dividend-yielding stocks with reliable dividend-paying history could be ideal bets.
We believe BP p.l.c. (BP), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI), and Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR) could be wise additions to one’s portfolio now for a steady stream of income.

But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), which is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), in Jacksonville, Fla., are two popular railroad operating companies in the United States. UNP hauls agricultural, automotive, and chemical products and offers long-haul routes from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to Eastern gateways, connects with Canada's rail systems and serves the major gateways to Mexico.

The railroad industry is recovering from its pandemic lows, owing to the gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions and the resumption of industrial activities. President Biden’s proposed infrastructure spending, which includes a general federal transportation support reauthorization, is expected to be a boon for the railroad industry. The market size of the U.S. rail transportation industry is expected to increase by 9.8% in 2021. So, both UNP and CSX should benefit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Monday that battery production for its recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle had resumed and that battery replacements will begin next month.
GM said supplier LG battery plants in Holland and Hazel Park, Michigan, have resumed production and LG is adding capacity to provide more battery cells to GM. 
Last week, the largest U.S. automaker said it would extend a shutdown of a Michigan assembly plant to mid-October following a new recall of its Bolt electric vehicles over battery issues after 13 reported fires. GM declined Monday to say when it might resume production of the vehicles. 
GM shares recovered some of their earlier losses after the announcement, closing down 3.8% at $49.37.
GM in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules, at a cost now estimated at $1.8 billion. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from LG.
GM said on Monday ""replacement battery modules will begin shipping to dealers as soon as mid-October.""
GM says the root cause of the rare circumstances that could cause a battery fire is two manufacturing defects known as a torn anode and a folded separator.
GM said LG has implemented new manufacturing processes and has worked with GM to ""review and enhance its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward.""
Within about 60 days, GM will launch a new ""advanced diagnostic software package that will increase the available battery charging parameters over existing guidance,"" it said.

The software is designed to detect ""specific abnormalities that might indicate a damaged battery.""
GM said owners should continue to park outside immediately after charging and not leave vehicles charging indoors overnight.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 suffered its biggest slump since May, amid fears a debt crisis at China Evergrande Group could spark credit crunch in China's crucial real estate sector, leading to a potential economic crisis in the world's second largest economy.    
The S&P 500 fell 1.7%, and is down about 5% from its recent highs. The Nasdaq fell 2.1%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.8%, or 614 points, though had fallen more than 900 points at the lows of the day. 
China Evergrande Group, the second largest property company in China, has more than $300 billion in liabilities, and reports suggest it won’t hit an interest payment deadline on its offshore bonds due Thursday.
Failure of the Chinese property giant to make good on its debt payments could force it into bankruptcy, sparking a wider liquidity crisis in real estate sector -- a key component of the nation's economy - that added to investor angst over growth, the impact of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, and ongoing budget negotiations on Capitol Hill. 
'The Evergrande crisis comes at a time when the Chinese consumer economy has slowed due to COVID-19 concerns ... this could combine to create growth challenges in China and many commodities,"" DA Davidson said in a note. ""This creates more risk for U.S. equity investors, who are already navigating concerns about peak growth of U.S. GDP and corporate earnings, consumer hesitancy caused by the COVID Delta variant, inflation, and Congressional budget negotiations,"" it added.
Fears of the potential economic crisis in China, the largest energy consumer, sent oil prices tumbling, and triggered a more than 4% drop in energy.
Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA), Hess (NYSE:HES) led the declines to the downside in energy.
Financials, meanwhile, were dragged lower by falling bank stocks amid a slump in U.S. Treasury yields, with Citigroup (NYSE:C), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) nursing heavy losses.
Tech also participated in the broad-based selloff as investors appeared to take a breather from the ‘buy the dip’ mentally ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting starting Tuesday.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), ended mostly more than 1% lower. 
Travel stocks, however, sidestepped the market malaise as airlines were boosted by easing travel restrictions.
The U.S. is set to ease travel restrictions for international visitors who are vaccinated against Covid-19 in November, the White House said Monday.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) outperformed relative to broader-market meltdown."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Illumina Inc expects an EU order to keep recently acquired Grail Inc as a separate company, the U.S. life sciences company said on Monday, hours after EU antitrust regulators warned of interim measures for closing the deal before their approval.
The company is likely to face other measures on top of the hold separate order, however, with the EU competition enforcer sending a warning to other companies.
Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) finalised the Grail takeover last month and said it would hold the company separate while waiting for a European Commission decision on the deal, defying EU merger rules against gun-jumping.
Previous instances of gun-jumping have resulted in companies being hit with million-euro fines. Sanctions can be as much as 10% of a company's global turnover.
""We had anticipated that the Commission would seek to impose a hold separate order, and this is the reason why it has already voluntarily agreed to such an arrangement; their proposals are based on Illumina's voluntary undertakings,"" Illumina said in a statement.
It said it would discuss certain changes suggested by the EU in the coming days.
The EU competition enforcer earlier on Monday said it had sent a statement of objections or charge sheet to the companies, setting out the interim measures it plans to take. It did not provide details.
Under EU merger rules, the competition watchdog can order companies to unwind their deals or sell off shares or assets acquired for violations.
Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager underlined the seriousness of Illumina's actions, saying it was the first time companies had openly implemented a deal while regulators were still investigating.
""The standstill obligation is a cornerstone of our ex-ante merger control regime which aims at preventing harmful effects to competition while our review is ongoing,"" she said in a statement.

The Commission said the interim measures aim to restore and maintain effective competition pending a final decision on the deal.
The Commission will make a final decision on the measures after receiving the companies' response.

Consequently, we think investors are better off avoiding fundamentally weak casino stocks  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN). Let’s discuss.The casino industry has experienced a decent recovery this year with the reopening of brick-and-mortar casinos and the growing popularity of online gambling. However, shares of Macau casino operators declined by approximately one-third of their values, losing about $18 billion, on September 15, as Macau declared stronger supervision of casino companies in the world’s largest gambling hub. Macau's secretary for economy and finance, Lei Wai Nong, gave notice of a 45-day consultation period, pointing to shortcomings in the industry’s supervision.
The new regulations are designed primarily to restrict illegal cash transfers and unregulated lending. However, the shares of U.S. operators suffered the worst selloffs on investor anxiety over the uncertainty surrounding the future of casinos in Macau.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to steer clear of casino stocks Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM), and Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN), which possess weak growth prospects and bleak financials.

Investing.com -- Stocks tumbled in volatile trading on Monday, with markets spooked by a debt crisis at China’s largest property developer.
The company, China Evergrande, could potentially miss a debt payment later this week, and that raised concerns that a contagion could sweep through global markets as have other big disruptions in the past.
But in the U.S., there are worries on multiple fronts, including a looming standoff in Congress over the federal debt ceiling along with the Federal Reserve’s two day policy meeting starting Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averageplunged more than 900 points and the S&P 500and NASDAQ Composite were also down sharply with less than an hour of trading left in the U.S. session.
Stocks are having a terrible September, with the Dow having its worst day since October last year, weighed by fears that Congress will raise corporate taxes as companies are trying to battle margin pressure because of rising input prices.
Investors are waiting to hear what Federal Reserve officials have to say Wednesday after their meeting. The central bankers are expected to debate the timing of the tapering of monthly bond purchases, though an actual announcement might not come until November or December.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 
1. Software earnings
Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) will release its third-quarter results Tuesday. The company is expected to announce earnings per share of $3.01 on revenue of $3.9 billion.
2. Shipping update
FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), the logistics company that was a beneficiary of the extra shipping activity during the pandemic, is seen posting revenue of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $4.94 for the first quarter. But most everyone will be listening to hear the company’s update on the next few months and business activity in general.
3. Get your car parts here
Parts and accessories seller AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO)’s fourth-quarter EPS is seen at $29.71 and revenue at $4.57 billion. Car sales ran hot during the pandemic as people bought used cars because of the chip shortage that delayed the rollout of new models.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's sweeping regulatory crackdown of recent months does not aim to rein in the country's private enterprises or decouple from the United States or international financial markets, a top Chinese regulatory official told Wall Street leaders last week.
The actions instead intend to strengthen the regulation of consumer-facing platform companies with a key role in promoting ""common prosperity"", or easing wealth inequality, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai said at a private gathering, according to attendees.
""I don't think you can find a government anywhere in the world that is as positive and as focused on technology as China,"" Fang was quoted as telling the fifth China-U.S. Financial Roundtable (CUFR) last Thursday.
Fang said, for example, that Beijing was expected to approve a record number of initial public offerings this year and a majority of companies going public in China would be private companies, said two of the people.
CSRC and Fang did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The sources who attended the meeting declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media about the discussions.
The attendees said Fang's remarks at the close of his presentation addressed China's unprecedented regulatory crackdown, which has wiped billions of dollars in market value https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/factbox-china-crackdown-wipes-hundreds-o-idUSKBN2G90CK off some of the country's best-known private firms and has weighed on foreign investor sentiment.
Bloomberg News reported on Saturday that the CSRC defended its crackdown https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-defends-clampdown-tech-firms-meeting-with-wall-st-execs-bloomberg-news-2021-09-19 on various industries during the roundtable meeting with Wall Street executives. 
COMMON PROSPERITY
China accelerated the pace of opening up its multi-trillion dollar financial sector to U.S. firms in recent years, after years of lobbying by Wall Street firms for better access, even as Sino-U.S. tensions rose on issues from trade to geopolitics.
However, Beijing's sweeping new policy moves - including crackdowns on internet companies, for-profit education, online gaming and property market excesses, and its ""common prosperity"" wealth-sharing drive to ease inequality - have rattled some foreign investors. 
That prompted officials and state media in recent weeks to try to assuage markets.
China's Vice Premier Liu He told a forum https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-liu-he-says-support-private-business-has-not-changed-2021-09-06 early this month that the government's policies and guidelines would keep supporting the private sector.
One of the participants said last week's comments by Fang, who is also the president of the CUFR, were well-received by his Wall Street audience.
""They listened very intently to what Fang had to say and most of us were very satisfied,"" said the person, referring to the Wall Street executives. 
The meeting was held virtually and attended by around 35 people including leaders of top Wall Street firms, said people with knowledge of the discussions.

The CUFR, formed amid escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies in 2018, last met virtually in October 2020 after meeting twice in person the previous year, before the coronavirus outbreak.
The meeting last week lasted for three-and-a-half-hours, and discussed ideas for further opening and developing financial markets and creating a level playing field between domestic and foreign entities in the world's second-largest economy.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped further into the red Monday, amid a jolt of volatility that swept through the market as investors mulled the broader implications of a liquidity crisis at China Evergrande Group.
The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.8%, or 966 points, the Nasdaq fell 3.4%.
China Evergrande Group, the second largest property company in China, has more than $300 billion in liabilities, and reports suggest it won’t hit an interest payment deadline on its offshore bonds due Thursday.
Failure of the Chinese property giant to make good on its debt payments could force it into bankruptcy, sparking a wider liquidity crisis in real estate sector -- a key component of the nation's economy - that some fear could trigger an economic crisis in China and severely hamper global growth.
The S&P 500 VIX Futures – Wall Street's so-called fear gauge - surged more than 30% in a sign that investors are growing nervous about the spillover of a economic crisis in China at time when Beijing has been cracking down on debt in sectors such as real estate.
“The source of the angst is ongoing worries about the broader implications of worsening developments at the beleaguered China Evergrande Group  […] reports that more companies in the property sector might be prospective targets for Beijing’s regulators,” Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note.
Fears of the potential economic crisis in China, the largest energy consumer, sent oil prices tumbling, and triggered a more than 4% drop in energy.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA), Hess (NYSE:HES) led the declines to the downside in energy.
Financials, meanwhile, were dragged lower by falling bank stocks amid a slump in U.S. Treasury yields, with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) nursing heavy losses.
Tech also participated in the broad-based selloff as investors appeared to take a breather from the ‘buy the dip’ mentally ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting starting Tuesday.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), fell more than 3%.
Travel stocks, however, sidestepped the market malaise as airlines were boosted by easing travel restrictions.
The U.S. is set to ease travel restrictions for international visitors who are vaccinated against Covid-19 in November, the White House said Monday.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) outperformed relative to broader-market meltdown."

The combination of the world's two largest aircraft leasing companies, which will rank as the largest buyer of airliners built by Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA), is due to be completed by the end of the year.
Asked if he expected further consolidation in the industry, which helps finance $150 billion of aircraft every year, Chief Commercial Officer Peter Anderson said: ""I do ... and frankly it would be welcome. There is enough room in this industry for several large players.""
""We welcome some discipline, rational competition in the market,"" he added, speaking to the Airline Economics conference in London. 
""There are some great platforms out there. Who buys who is a completely different question which I don't know the answer to.""
The aircraft leasing sector finances 50-60% of all new passenger aircraft deliveries, its highest ever level, Anderson said. 
He said Airbus and Boeing may become more cautious about how many planes they sell to smaller players since some lessors delayed deliveries during the COVID-19 crisis. 
They ""are going to be a little more conservative with the lessors in terms of who they sell to and how big they sell,"" Anderson said. 
AerCap is facing a mixed recovery in the airline sector, Anderson said. 
""It's not a constant recovery. It's going to be rocky for a while,"" he said, pointing to Southeast Asia as a laggard. 

But he said a strengthening of the sector meant that the ""window was closing"" for airlines to get the kind of concessions that were offered in recent months to help struggling carriers stay afloat. 
There is not likely to be any lasting impact in lease rates due to COVID-19, he said.

A year ago, when the ceremony was held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, the audience for the highest awards in television slumped to 6.4 million viewers.
CBS said Sunday's TV audience was the largest since 2018. The figure does not include those who watched outside home, or in bars and restaurants.
Viewership for all award shows has been dropping for years. The recent high for the Emmys was in 2013, when some 17.7 million people tuned in.

(Reuters) - U.S. grain exports increased last week as shippers along the Louisiana Gulf Coast recovered from flooding and widespread power outages caused by Hurricane Ida's Aug. 29 landfall, but volumes were much lower than normal, preliminary data showed on Monday.
Just seven export vessels were loaded with grain and soybeans at Louisiana Gulf Coast terminals in the week ended Sept. 16, down from 23 vessels in the same week last year, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data showed.
Ida crippled overseas grain shipments weeks before the start of the Midwest harvest and the busiest period for U.S. crop exports, sending export prices soaring and stoking global worries about food inflation.
Weekly USDA grain inspections data, an early indicator of shipments abroad, showed the volume of corn weighed and certified for export last week reached 403,104 tonnes, up from the previous week's revised tally of 159,429 tonnes, an 8-1/2 year low.
For soybeans, weekly export inspections reached 275,169 tonnes, up from the prior week's revised count of 193,429 tonnes.
The USDA said 199,849 tonnes of corn and 150,272 tonnes of soybeans in the latest week were inspected along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The figures marked an improvement from the prior week, when no grain was inspected at the busiest outlet for U.S. crops.
Still, for corn, the latest figure was down about 48% from the year-ago inspections figure of 768,084 tonnes. [USDA/I]
More than 60 bulk vessels were lined up along the lower Mississippi River on Monday waiting to dock and load with grain once terminals reopen, an industry vessel lineup report and Refinitiv Eikon shipping data showed.
Most of the nearly dozen large grain terminals dotted along the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico escaped the storm with minor damage, but the region's devastated power grid hobbled the recovery.

Cargill Inc said it reopened its Westwego, Louisiana, grain export terminal last week, by which time rivals Louis Dreyfus Co and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co had been loading export shipments for several days.
A Destrehan, Louisiana, facility owned by  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd has been ""running intermittently,"" the company said on Thursday, while CHS Inc said it expected its Myrtle Grove, Louisiana, export terminal to be operational by the height of the U.S. corn and soy harvest, which typically peaks in October.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 01:51PM ET</span>",Universal Music valued around $39 billion ahead of stock market debut,"By Matthieu Protard and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Universal Music Group, the business behind singers such as Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, is valued at around 33.5 billion euros ($39.30 billion) ahead of the record label's stock market debut in Amsterdam on Tuesday.
France's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) is spinning off Universal and on Monday set a reference price for the listing at 18.5 euros per share, according to a statement issued by Euronext. 
Universal Music Group's (UMG) listing will be Europe's largest this year and will hand 60% of shares to Vivendi shareholders.
Universal is betting that a boom in streaming led by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) that has fuelled royalty revenue and profit growth for several years still has a long way to run, in a music industry it dominates along with Warner and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music, part of Sony Group Corp.
Its flotation carries high stakes for Canal+ owner Vivendi, which hopes to rid itself of a conglomerate discount. However, the listing raises questions about Vivendi's strategy once it parts ways with its cash cow, in which it will retain only a 10% stake. 
Several high-profile investors have also already snapped up large Universal stakes, banking in part on the group's back catalogue, which includes the likes of Bob Dylan and the Beatles. They also hope deals with ad-supported software and social media platforms such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube and TikTok will sustain its performance and valuation.
U.S. billionaire William Ackman suffered a setback when his attempt to invest in Universal via a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) hit a snag with regulators and investors. However, Ackman still got a 10% stake via his Pershing Square hedge fund. China's Tencent owns 20% of Universal.
One winner in the listing will be Vincent Bollore, the French media tycoon who is Vivendi's controlling shareholder. He will receive Universal shares worth 6 billion euros at Monday's price.
Bollore has been an aggressive consolidator in France's media and publishing landscape, and he has a long-held ambition to build up a southern European media powerhouse.
Vivendi itself may suffer in the short run, however, and shares are expected to fall Tuesday as they begin trading without Universal.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Natixis, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) are the lead financial advisers on the deal, out of 17 banks in total -- an unusually large total.
The fee pot is expected to be below standard listings as no fresh cash is being raised as part of the spin-off. 
Universal said in its prospectus that the overall expenses to be paid in relation to the Universal deal would not go beyond 0.5% of the total amount of the share distribution.
The listing is the latest win for Euronext in Amsterdam, which has grown as a financial centre in the wake of Britain's departure from the European Union. Before Universal, Amsterdam had attracted a record 14 IPOs so far this year, of which 10 were SPACs.

But the only Amsterdam listing of a size comparable to Universal in recent history was the 95 billion euro listing of technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF), also a spin-off, in September 2019.
($1 = 0.8524 euros)

713,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>",Pfizer/BioNTech say data show COVID-19 vaccine safe and protective in kids,"By Michael Erman
(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on Monday their COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response in 5 to 11 year olds, and they plan to ask for regulatory authorization as soon as possible to use the shot in children in that age range in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. 
The companies said their two-dose vaccine generated an immune response in the 5-to-11 year olds in a Phase II/III clinical trial that matched what was previously observed in 16-to-25 year olds. The safety profile was also generally comparable to the older age group, they added.
""Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. - underscoring the public health need for vaccination,""  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a news release. 
""These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency,"" Bourla added.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already has won U.S. regulatory authorization for people age 12 and up, including full Food and Drug Administration approval https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine last month for ages 16 and up.
Top U.S. health officials believe regulators could make a decision https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-us-decision-pfizer-covid-19-shot-kids-age-5-11-could-come-october-2021-09-10 on whether the shot is safe and effective in younger children within three weeks of the companies submitting a request for authorization, two sources told Reuters this month. A rapid authorization could help mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide.
COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths have surged in the United States in recent months due to the highly contagious Delta variant, especially in areas with low vaccination rates even as President Joe Biden implores vaccine holdouts to get their shots. Pediatric cases are also up, particularly as children under 12 are all unvaccinated, but there is no indication that, beyond being more transmissible, the Delta virus is more dangerous in kids.
FDA acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said that once the agency receives the application, its process for determining if the vaccine is safe and effective for children in the younger age group includes verifying the manufacturing processes for the lower concentrations of the shots and any study of its safety.
""We'll look at the clinical data and make sure that children responded to the vaccine the way we would expect,"" Woodcock said during an appearance on former Biden administration official Andy Slavitt's podcast.
Pfizer shares fell 1.3% to $43.28 before the bell on Monday amid broader market weakness. 
DATA FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, called Comirnaty, is authorized for use in children as young as 12 in many countries in addition to the United States. It was originally authorized for emergency use in people 16 or older in the United States in December 2020.
The 5-to-11 year olds were given two shots of a 10-microgram dose of the vaccine, a third the dose size given to people 12 and older. 
In addition, the companies said they expect data on how well the vaccine works in children ages 2-to-5 years and children ages 6 months-to-2 years as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. 
Unlike the larger clinical trial that the drugmakers previously conducted in adults, the 2,268-participant pediatric trial was not primarily designed to measure the vaccine's efficacy by comparing the number of COVID-19 cases in vaccine recipients to those who received a placebo.
Instead, it compares the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in the adult trial.
A Pfizer spokesperson said the companies may later disclose vaccine efficacy from the trial but there have not been enough cases of COVID-19 yet among the participants to make that determination.
The vaccine was around 95 percent effective in the adult clinical trial, but Pfizer has said that immunity wanes some months after the second dose. U.S. regulators are expected to authorize a third, booster dose of the vaccine for older and high-risk Americans early this week. 
The companies said the vaccine was well-tolerated, with side effects generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age. 

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of three shots authorized in the United States, along with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s two-dose vaccine and Johnson and Johnson's one-dose shot. The Moderna and J&J (NYSE:JNJ) shots have not yet received full FDA approval for any age groups. 
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been linked by regulators to rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, particularly young men. Pfizer said they did not see any instances of heart inflammation in the trial participants.

CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With demand for toys at an all-time high, U.S. suppliers and retailers are racing to outrun severe air, sea and land shipping snarls so Santa has a mountain of dolls, scooters and video game consoles to deliver at Christmas. 
The holidays account for a major chunk of the toy industry's nearly $33 billion annual sales, and LEGO blocks, MGA Entertainment's L.O.L. Surprise dolls, Mattel's Barbies and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation game consoles were among top sellers last year. 
Hitches in logistics could result in empty-handed consumers and lost sales for retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) - where Reuters and analysts this year have seen some gaps in shelves among seasonal items, from school supplies and backpacks to Halloween decor and costumes. Reuters spoke with six leading toy makers - including MGA, Kids2 and Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) Inc - that said they are using pricey cargo planes, routing shipments to new seaports, and asking retailers like Target to do their own shipping.
In the first seven months of 2021, U.S. imports of dolls, toys and games - one key slice of the toy market - averaged $1.88 billion per month, up 50% from the same period in 2019, said Jason Miller, associate professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's Eli Broad College of Business. 
Miller, who checked imports back to 2002, said the first seven months of 2021 are a record.
""There is more demand than we can supply,"" Isaac Larian, CEO of California-based MGA, said, referring to retail orders. 
Walmart and Target, which have hired their own ships in the scramble to secure goods, did not comment on holiday toy inventories.
Macy's (N:M) said in August that it would open Toys'R'Us sections in more than 400 of its stores next year, hoping to tap the nostalgia associated with what was the biggest U.S. toy chain for decades before it went out of business in 2018. The company, which has already begun selling toys online under the Toys'R'Us brand, placed toy orders up to three months earlier than usual, said Stephen Moore, an executive at the department store.'IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE' 
 Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) in July warned that its supplies were disrupted when COVID-19 related temporary port and plant shutdowns in Asia worsened shipping container shortages. The company did not comment for this story.
MGA is one of many toy sellers flying in products to overcome ocean delays that can stretch from days to months. For the first seven months of this year, import tonnage of toys into the U.S. by air was more than two times what it was for the same period in 2019, said Frederic Horst, managing director of Cargo Facts Consulting in Australia.
Much of that gain was fueled by pricey video game consoles https://www.reuters.com/article/gaming-sony-microsoft-focus-int/clash-of-consoles-new-playstation-and-xbox-enter-150-billion-games-arena-fight-idUSKBN27P09A, the data showed, signaling another year of shoppers battling it out https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-ecommerce-scalper-bots/insight-good-luck-finding-a-playstation-5-walmart-and-other-retailers-battle-bots-snatching-up-hot-products-idUSL1N2IO02C for PlayStations and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xboxes.
With most planes spoken for, demand for air charters is at a level never seen before, said Neel Jones Shah, global head of air freight at Flexport. He said one-way charter flights now cost $1.2-$1.5 million, versus upwards of $500,000 in normal times. ""There's no capacity left, it almost would take a miracle for you to find a charter between now and the end of November, early December,"" Jones Shah said. 
Airplanes can't easily supplant cargo ships which can carry thousands of containers at once, so toymakers are tweaking their ocean shipping strategies to navigate global gridlock. Kids2, the maker of Baby Einstein toys, expanded its seaports from two to nine. It also added seven freight forwarders in the Far East. Adding those forwarders, who arrange shipping for companies, has increased output by 30%. 'PROBLEM ON PROBLEM ON PROBLEM' 
With the holiday toy push gearing up, supplier LEGO said it isn't ""experiencing any significant disruption to the overall supply of our products or raw materials and are able to meet demand"" because its factories and distribution centers are close to its markets. 
While stores currently have ""healthy"" stocks of toys, that could change as Christmas nears and shipping disruptions ranging from COVID-19 to overbooked cargo ships cascade, said Ed Desmond, the Toy Association's executive vice president of external affairs. ""We just don't know what's going to happen down the road,"" Desmond said as toy companies sweat cascading shipping snafus.
""We've had multiple containers just sitting in Asia, the factories are backed up - it's just problem on problem on problem,"" said Kids2 CEO Ryan Gunnigle. Funko said 70% of its non-plush Pop! products are made in Vietnam - where COVID-19 lockdowns hit port operations - so it is sending toys to be picked up in China by customers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart.

Demand for Funko's holiday products - including bobble-head figures like The Nightmare Before Christmas' Jack Skellington and a Minnie Mouse with a Santa hat - is at an all-time high, while supply has never been more constrained, said incoming CEO Andrew Perlmutter, who projected that the company would sell out of some products starting in November. The problem is even worse for Manhattan Toys, which sells stuffed animals and other items to Walmart, Target and other stores. ""We're a small company so even we get lucky on a vessel, they bump us - we're trying to accommodate for that by paying anywhere from five to 10 times as much for a container,"" said Nora O’Leary, Manhattan Toys CEO. 
""The whole system has to adapt and it's hard to do,"" Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Illinois-based toy maker Learning Resources, said. ""Christmas can't be delayed.""

Let’s discuss.Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focused investing has increased exponentially due to growing climate change concerns and the rising demand for socially responsible business activity. According to a Morningstar report, sustainable funds’ total assets rose 19% to nearly $2 trillion in the first quarter, marking a record high for the fourth quarter in a row. Investor’s interest in sustainability-focused investing is evidenced by the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF’s (ESGV) 5.5% gains over the past three months.
Last month, S&P Dow Jones CEO Dan Drape asserted that ESG-based investing is one of their biggest growth opportunities. Furthermore, according to BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) head of iShares Americas, Armando Senra, ESG investments could become a $1 trillion category by 2030.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on shares of established companies Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Visa Inc .

The airline, which is owned by IAG (LON:ICAG) and recently bought struggling Spanish rival Air Europa in a cut-price deal, said that it would propose a furlough to workers citing ""organisational and productive causes"".
It did not give further details of what any possible deal could entail. 
""The slowdown of the economic recovery and the growing uncertainty as to whether, and under which conditions, the force majeure furloughs will apply to the aerial sector have spurred Iberia to begin negotiations with its labour unions,"" the company said in a statement.

The airline added that it continued to operate 30-35% below pre-pandemic levels, largely due to the restrictions on tourism towards the United States, Latin America, Japan and China.
Air travel to Spain has slowly begun to recover in recent months with 5 million international passengers arriving in August, according to official data released on Monday, soaring by 172% from a year ago, but less than half pre-pandemic levels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing companies are for the first time buying more of the world's passenger planes than airlines after the pandemic clobbered carriers around the world, senior industry executives said on Monday.
The historic shift, following decades of gradual growth, is down to leasing giants being able to access cheaper financing than carriers in another sign of the financial woes facing much of the airline industry, they said.
Aircraft lessors, who buy planes from manufacturers like Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and lease them on to airlines, had accounted for around 40-45% of aircraft deliveries before the pandemic, said industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy. 
""Leased content has grown to around 60% of deliveries,"" Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of lessor Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp, told the Airline Economics conference in London.
Udvar-Hazy, who said he remembered the sector providing finance for just 1% of deliveries when he helped pioneer the industry in the early 1970s, said it was hard to say if the number could go higher. 
""It's in a range now that is probably a good equilibrium for the industry,"" he told Reuters. ""I never thought it would get to 50% or even 40%.""
As the industry recovers, airlines may recover the ability to get the financing on their own, he added. 
A senior executive for larger rival AerCap agreed that the leasing sector was now responsible for financing a majority of new passenger jet deliveries, financing somewhere between 50% and 60%. 
""Going into COVID, we were always 'will we ever get to 50%?' and we've blown through that,"" AerCap Chief Commercial Officer Peter Anderson told Reuters, adding he thought the new level was sustainable. 
Udvar-Hazy said the 60% number included sale-and-leasebacks, finance leases and operating leases. 
He said the industry's manufacturing duopoly of Airbus and Boeing were comfortable with the shift in power from the airlines to the leasing companies. 

""It's much better for Airbus to have a financially capable buyer,"" he said. ""The leasing industry has the capital to show up at delivery and actually take delivery."" 
Some lessors are paying under 2% for finance compared with over 4% for some of the largest airlines in the United States and Europe, Udvar-Hazy told the conference, the first major gathering of leasing sector since the pandemic hit.

Investing.com – Coinbase stock (NASDAQ:COIN) recouped some losses but still traded 6% lower Monday after the platform succumbed to pressure from regulators and dropped plans to launch a crypto lending business.
The company announced its decision in a blog post Friday.
In a communication to the crypto platform, the Securities and Exchange Commission had threatened to sue the company if it went ahead with its plans to let users earn interest by lending crypto assets.
This came to light when early this month, the crypto exchange’s Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong, took on the markets regulator publicly.
“If you don't want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry,” Armstrong tweeted on September 8 while pointing out that plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer the lending feature.
He lamented that the regulator has failed to provide any guidance on the products even as it threatens to take it to court.
The slump in cryptos today added to the weakness in Coinbase. Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the largest crypto by market cap, fell more than 7% to trade just above $44,000, recouping some of the losses after it fell to 42,547.1 earlier in the day.

(Reuters) - Partners Group Holding AG told Reuters on Monday it raised $15 billion for a private equity program to invest in assets such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods companies.
Partners Group amassed $6 billion for its fourth flagship direct equity fund and an additional $9 billion through separately managed accounts investing alongside the fund, Partners Group Chief Executive David Layton said in an interview.
There has been a flurry of dealmaking by private equity firms seeking to take advantage of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Partners Group said its new private equity program has already invested about $6 billion to acquire stakes in 17 companies. They include Reedy Industries, a Deerfield, Illinois-based industrial firm, women's healthcare provider Axia Women's Health, and European drugmaker Pharmathen, which Partners Group acquired from BC Partners for 1.6 billion euros ($1.89 billion) in July.
""This is very much a continuation of the strategy we have put in place over the last programs. What we're really focused on is finding sectors that we believe are structurally sound with a potential to grow while avoiding sectors with potential for disruption risks,"" Layton said.
Partners Group said it plans to invest the remaining capital in its latest private equity fund in mid-market companies, which have an enterprise value of less than $2 billion, operating in sectors including beauty and personal care products, sustainable agriculture, next-generation supply chain, biopharmaceuticals, and technology.
For its third flagship buyout fund that closed in 2017, Partners Group had raised 3 billion euros and an additional 3 billion euros in separately managed accounts committed alongside the fund. That fund had generated a net internal rate of return of 22% as of the end of June this year, the firm said.

The inaugural Partners Group buyout fund had collected $800 million in 2009 and its successor fund had raised $1.8 billion in 2012.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Growing fears of China Evergrande defaulting rattled global markets on Monday as investors worried about the potential impact on the wider economy dumped Chinese property stocks and sought refuge in safe-haven assets.
Shares in Evergrande, which has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders, suppliers and investors, closed down 10.2% at HK$2.28 on Monday, after earlier plummeting 19% to its weakest level since May 2010.
Regulators have warned that its $305 billion of liabilities could spark broader risks to China's financial system if its debts are not stabilised.
World shares skidded and the dollar firmed as investors fretted about the spillover risk to the global economy. U.S. stocks were sharply lower, with the S&P 500 down nearly 2%. (N)
A major test comes this week, with Evergrande due to pay $83.5 million in interest relating to its March 2022 bond on Thursday. It has another $47.5 million payment due on Sept. 29 for March 2024 notes. 
Both bonds would default if Evergrande fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates.
In any default scenario, Evergrande, teetering https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-house-cards-evergrande-threatens-wider-real-estate-market-2021-09-14 between a messy meltdown, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing, will need to restructure the bonds, but analysts expect a low recovery ratio for investors. 
Evergrande's troubles also pressured the broader property sector, with Hong Kong-listed shares of small-sized Chinese developer Sinic Holdings down 87%, wiping $1.5 billion off its market value before trading was suspended.
Evergrande executives are working to salvage its business prospects, including by starting to repay investors in its wealth management products with real estate.
""(Evergrande's) stock will continue to fall, because there's not yet a solution that appears to be helping the company to ease its liquidity stress, and there are still so many uncertainties about what the company will do in case of a restructuring,"" Kington Lin, managing director of Asset Management Department at Canfield Securities Limited, said.
Lin said Evergrande's shares could fall to below HK$1 if it is forced to sell most of its assets in a restructuring.
""As of right now, I don't see any systemic risk for the global economy from the Evergrande situation, but there doesn't need to be any systemic risk in order for markets to be affected,"" David Bahnsen, chief investment officer, The Bahnsen Group, a wealth management firm based in Newport Beach, Calif, said in emailed commentary. 
There was some confidence, however, that the situation would be contained. 
""Beijing has demonstrated in recent years that it is fully able and willing to step in to stem widespread contagion when major financial/corporate institutions fail,"" Alvin Tan, FX Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. 
DOLLAR BONDS 
Despite mounting worries about the future of what was once the country's top-selling property developer, analysts, however, have played down comparisons to the 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
""First, the dollar bonds will likely get restructured, but most of the debt is in global mutual funds, ETFs, and some Chinese companies and not banks or other important financial institutions,"" said LPL Financials' Ryan Detrick.
""Lehman Brothers was held on nearly all other financial institution's books,"" he said. ""Secondly, we think the odds do favor the Chinese communist government will get involved should there be a default.""
Policymakers in China have been telling Evergrande's major lenders to extend interest payments or rollover loans, but market watchers are largely of the view that a direct bailout from the government is unlikely.
The People's Bank of China, its central bank, and the nation's banking watchdog summoned Evergrande's executives in August in a rare move and warned that it needed to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
Trading of the company's bonds underscore just how dramatically investor expectations of its prospects have deteriorated this year.
The 8.25% March 2022 dollar bond was traded at 29.156 cents on Monday, yielding over 500%, compared to 13.7% at the start of year. The 9.5% March 2024 bond was at 26.4 cents, yielding over 80%, compared to 14.6% at the start of 2021.
PROPERTY PUNISHED
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said last week that because Evergrande has dollar bonds issued by both the parent and a special purpose vehicle, recoveries in a potential restructuring could differ between the two sets of bonds, and the process may be prolonged.
Investors, meanwhile, are increasingly worried about the contagion risk, mainly in the debt-laden Chinese property sector, which along with the yuan came under pressure on Monday. 
The yuan fell to a three-week low of 6.4831 per dollar in offshore trade.
Hong Kong-listed Sinic, which saw massive selling pressure, has nearly $700 million in offshore debts maturing before June 2022, including $246 million due in a month -- a bond which has tumbled to around 89 cents on the dollar.
Sinic has a junk rating from Fitch, which downgraded its outlook to negative on Friday.
Other property stocks such as Sunac, China's No.4 property developer, tumbled 10.5%, while state-backed Greentown China shed around 6.7%.

Guangzhou R&F Properties Co said on Monday it was raising as much as $2.5 billion by borrowing from major shareholders and selling a subsidiary, highlighting the scramble for cash as distress signals spread in the sector. [L1N2QM0XG]

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's meat processors will start running out of carbon dioxide (CO2) within five days, forcing them to halt production and impacting supplies to retailers, the industry's lobby group warned on Monday.
A jump in gas prices has forced several domestic energy suppliers out of business and has shut fertiliser plants that also make CO2 as a by-product of their production process.
The CO2 gas is used to stun animals before slaughter, in the vacuum packing of food products to extend their shelf life, and to put the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks. CO2's solid form is dry ice, which is used in food deliveries.
The CO2 crisis has compounded an acute shortage of truck drivers in the UK, which has been blamed on the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit.
""My members are saying anything between five, 10 and 15 days supply (remain),"" Nick Allen of the British Meat Processors Association told Sky News.
With no CO2, a meat processor cannot operate, he said.
""The animals have to stay on farm. They'll cause farmers on the farm huge animal welfare problems and British pork and British poultry will disappear off the shelves,"" Allen said.
""We're two weeks away from seeing some real impacts on the shelves,"" he said, adding that poultry could start disappearing from shops even sooner.
Allen said the government was working to try and resolve the issue and might be able to persuade fertiliser producer CF Industries (NYSE:CF) to re-start its UK plants.
Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he met CF Industries CEO Tony Will on Sunday to explore ways to secure CO2 supplies.
""Work is ongoing ... to ensure that those sectors which are impacted by this ... have appropriate contingency plans in place to ensure that there is minimal disruption,"" he told parliament.
Meanwhile, the British Soft Drinks Association warned some manufacturers had only a few days of CO2 left.
UNHAPPY CHRISTMAS?
Some in the poultry industry fear a Christmas crisis.
Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of 2 Sisters Food Group and Bernard Matthews, said the CO2 issue was ""a massive body blow"", noting that the supply of turkeys this Christmas was already compromised by labour shortages.
Shares in processor Cranswick, whose products include fresh pork and chicken and gourmet sausages, fell 4% after it said production could be halted. 
The crisis is also having a more immediate impact.
Online supermarket group Ocado (LON:OCDO) said it had temporarily reduced the number of lines it is able to deliver from its frozen range. Dry ice is used to keep items frozen during delivery. Ocado shares fell 1.6%.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents retailers including the major supermarket groups, said the CO2 shortage had compounded existing pressures on production and distribution.
""... it is vital that government takes immediate action to prioritise suppliers and avoid significant disruption to food supplies,"" said Andrew Opie, the BRC's director of food and sustainability.
Britain's National Farmers Union said it was concerned about the shortages of fertiliser and CO2.

""We’re aware of the added strain this puts on a food supply chain already under significant pressure due to lack of labour,"" NFU vice president Tom Bradshaw said.
Britain's big four supermarket groups - market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons declined to comment.

OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Norway agreed on Monday to increase natural gas exports to the rest of Europe as record high wholesale natural gas prices prompted suppliers in Britain to seek state support and raised fears of a food supply crunch. 
Wholesale gas prices have soared in recent months as economies reopened from COVID-19 lockdowns and high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia pushed down supplies to Europe, leading to a shortage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the food industry.
Britain's biggest energy companies have asked the government for support to help cover the cost of taking on customers from firms that have gone bust due to soaring wholesale gas prices, sources in the companies said.
Equinor, Europe's second-largest gas supplier after Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), said on Monday that Norway was allowing a combined 2 billion cubic metre (bcm) increase in exports for the gas year starting Oct. 1 from the Troll and Oseberg fields.
The increase corresponds to nearly 2% of Norway's annual pipeline gas exports, according to Reuters calculations.
British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the move by Norway, which supplies just under a third of Britain's gas, but sought to reassure consumers that there would be no crisis.
""We have sufficient capacity and more than sufficient capacity to meet demand, and we do not expect supply emergencies to occur,"" Kwarteng told parliament.
He said there would be no return to the 1970s when Britain was plagued by power cuts that made the economy the 'sick man of Europe', with three-day working weeks and people unable to heat their homes.
""This winter, there's absolutely no question, Mr Speaker, of the lights going out or people being unable to heat their homes.""
European consumers though are facing the prospect of soaring winter heating bills due to a confluence of global factors that have raised questions about how vulnerable Europe remains to swings in global energy prices.
Benchmark European gas prices have risen by more than 250% since January due to low storage stocks, high European Union carbon prices, soaring demand in Asia, lower gas supplies from Russia, low renewable output and nuclear maintenance outages.
Surging gas prices have led to an array of stresses in other markets, including a shortage of carbon dioxide after fertilizer plants had to shut. 

Some of Britain's meat processors will run out of CO2 - also used to put the fizz in beer, cider and soft drinks - within five days, forcing them to halt production, the head of the industry's lobby group warned.

""More significant from the perspective of world markets is the concerning situation with huge Chinese property developer Evergrande, which appears to be teetering on the precipice with concerns about contagion from the situation infecting the wider economy in China. This is particularly bad news for miners,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 
The benchmark European STOXX 600 has declined for three straight weeks on worries about slowing global growth, soaring inflation, persistently high COVID-19 cases and the spillover from tighter regulation of Chinese firms.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday is in focus as the central bank is expected to lay the groundwork for a trimming of its massive pandemic stimulus. Overall, 16 central banks are scheduled to hold meetings this week, including in the UK, Norway, Switzerland and Japan. 
""Expectations are growing the U.S. central bank will start laying out the groundwork for a tapering of bond purchases, potentially tee-ing up for a November kick-off,"" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.

(Reuters) - A court-appointed receiver has recouped more than $1 billion for victims of Texas financier Allen Stanford's Ponzi scheme, the largest by dollar amount other than Bernard Madoff's fraud, the receiver's lawyers said on Monday.
The threshold was crossed when Ralph Janvey, the receiver for Stanford Financial Group, received $65 million from a June 2016 settlement with insurers including Lloyd's of London, which won final court approval in January after years of litigation.
Janvey expects to distribute money from the settlement in the first quarter of 2022. As of April 29, he had received court approval to distribute about $550 million, and had distributed $443 million.
Once considered a billionaire but later declared indigent, Stanford, 71, is serving a 110-year prison sentence following his 2012 conviction for running a $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme affecting approximately 18,000 former investors.
Prosecutors said Stanford sold fraudulent high-yielding certificates of deposit through his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank, and used investor money to make risky investments and fund a lavish lifestyle.
The fraud lasted about two decades, and was uncovered in February 2009.
""When the receivership started, the receiver found only $63 million in a bank that was supposed to be holding more than $7 billion,"" Kevin Sadler, a Baker Botts partner representing Janvey, said in an interview. ""It has taken more than 12 years, but getting to $1 billion is a significant achievement.""
More recoveries are possible.
Janvey is defending against appeals from a $124.9 million judgment he won against Colorado billionaire Gary Magness.
He is also working with the Official Stanford Investors Committee on a $4 billion lawsuit against five former Stanford banks including HSBC, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and TD Bank. 
Last month, U.S. District Judge David Godbey in Dallas rejected HSBC's and Societe Generale's bids to dismiss that case.

Recovery efforts from Madoff's Ponzi scheme have recouped more than $18 billion for victims.
Madoff died in April at age 82 while serving a 150-year prison term. His fraud was uncovered in December 2008.

Because several manufacturers plan production cuts due to the chip crunch, the industry is expected to generate weak momentum in the near term. Therefore, we think it may be prudent to avoid financially weak EV stocks Fisker Inc. (FSR) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE), whose ratings have recently been downgraded by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Read on.Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to dominate the automotive market eventually as governments across the world implement various measures to reduce carbon emissions. However, recent production and supply bottlenecks have caused some companies in this space to suffer declining financials.
A worldwide semiconductor chip shortage is expected to stifle the EV industry's growth prospects because several players intend to drastically reduce output and close down factories temporarily. Furthermore, intense competition in the EV space as dominant automakers increase their EV investments to capitalize on the industry tailwinds could mar the growth of smaller players.
Thus, we think investors should avoid Fisker Inc. (FSR) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (RIDE), which were recently downgraded by analysts at Bank of America, given these companies’ weak fundamentals and negative earnings growth potential.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Didi co-founder Liu told associates she plans to leave - sources,"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Didi Global Inc co-founder and President Jean Liu has told some close associates that she intends to step down, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the Chinese ride-hailing giant faces intense regulatory scrutiny following its New York listing earlier this year.
Liu, 43, has in recent weeks told some associates that she expected the government to eventually take control of Didi and appoint new management, said the two sources. 
Liu, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) banker, told a couple of executives close to her in recent weeks - including those who had followed her to join Didi from the Wall Street bank - that she planned to leave and encouraged them to start looking for new opportunities as well, said one of the sources who was briefed on the matter.
Some of those executives have since approached industry contacts for job leads, the source said.
Reuters was unable to learn further details, including whether Liu had submitted a formal resignation letter or set a date to leave.
Didi said it is ""actively and fully cooperating with the cybersecurity review. Reuters' rumors about management changes are untrue and unsubstantiated."" 
Liu did not respond to Reuters request for comment sent via the company spokespersons. 
Didi’s shares were recently down nearly 5% in U.S. trading on Monday. The benchmark S&P 500 index was recently off around 1.7% in a broader selloff fueled by worries over heavily indebted Chinese property company Evergrande. 
Didi, sometimes dubbed the Uber of China, has come under intense scrutiny since early July by Chinese authorities over its collection and use of personal data of users of its service, pricing mechanisms and competitive practices.
Officials have launched a broad crackdown on private companies, including those in the tech sector, to control big data and break down monopolistic practices.
Billionaires minted by high-profile listings, such as Didi's $4.4 billion debut, have fallen out of favor as President Xi Jinping warns against the country's vast income inequality. 
Didi ran afoul of the powerful Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) when it pressed ahead with its debut on June 30, despite the regulator urging the company to put it on hold while it conducted a cybersecurity review of its data practices, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Soon after the listing, the CAC announced an investigation into Didi and subsequently ordered the removal of its apps for download in China. Officials from at least six other departments also got involved.
Reuters could not learn whether regulators had asked for Liu's departure and what would happen to other executives, such as Didi Chairman and CEO Will Cheng. 
One of the sources familiar with Liu's plans said the Harvard alumni and daughter of Lenovo Group (OTC:LNVGY) founder Liu Chuanzhi had also talked about leaving Didi in the years before the current regulatory crisis to try her hand at something new.
CAC did not respond to Reuters request for comment, while Didi did not respond to specific questions. 
Liu joined Didi in 2014. She holds a 1.6% stake, worth around $640 million currently, in the company and controls 23% of the vote, thanks to a dual-class share structure, according to the company's prospectus.

She has been deeply involved in the company's key corporate financial decisions, including its merger with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd-backed Kuaidi in 2015, takeover of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's China business and fundraising from investors including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Liu also oversees Didi's other corporate matters including human resources and represents the company in external communications especially during crises.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Universal Studios' Beijing resort opened its doors to the public on Monday after a two-decade wait, including delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The highly anticipated opening takes place amid U.S.-China relations that have deteriorated in recent years.
The park will be U.S.-based Universal's largest and its fifth globally. It is also a first for Beijing, which lacks a big branded theme park to rival the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
And, it will be the first Universal park with a section dedicated to the movie ""Kung Fu Panda"" and includes an area based on the Harry Potter franchise, which is popular in China.
Amid light rain and tight security on Monday, a public holiday in China to mark the Mid-Autumn Festival, a steady stream of umbrella-wielding visitors entered the resort. 
""When it comes to Universal Studios, we're all big fans of Marvel movies,"" said 27-year-old Beijing resident Pi Tiantian, who visited the park on Monday.
""We really want to experience this resort. This one here also really likes Harry Potter,"" she added, pointing to a young male companion.
One Universal Studios employee told Reuters that visitor numbers were being capped at around 10,000 for Monday because of the pandemic but the park has the capacity for many more.
All 10,000 tickets for the opening, available in a pre-sale on Sept. 14, were sold out in three minutes, according to Trip.com Group.
""This is a rare time in a long while when an America-themed topic has attracted such obvious and widespread praise in China,"" the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, wrote last week. 
Beijing-based visitors snatched 40% of the tickets for the first month, while the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai were the second- and third-largest sources of patrons, according to travel website qunar.com.
Still, many buyers complained on social media about ticket costs, which range from 418 yuan ($64.76) in the low season to 748 yuan during peak periods.
The resort was proposed 20 years ago by the Beijing Tourism Group, according to the official China Daily, and is 30% owned by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Universal Parks & Resorts and 70% by state-owned Beijing Shouhuan Cultural Tourism Investment.
The new Chinese ambassador to Washington, Qin Gang, likened the park's rollercoaster ride to ties between the two countries.
""After all the tumbling and shakes, the rollercoaster came to a soft landing in the end,"" he tweeted on Sept. 14. 
Universal Studios announced the development of the resort in 2014 at an estimated cost of $3.3 billion. In 2017, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said https://www.attractionsmanagement.com/index.cfm?subID=0&pagetype=news&codeID=334757&dom=n&email=web&pub=AMe&date= the park could provide $1 billion of operating cash flow per year once open. 

The park is estimated to earn more than 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) a year in revenue with up to 12 million visits, according to state-run Beijing Daily.

745,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Raises $2.5 Billion Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- Steven Mnuchin has started his next act with a multibillion-dollar fund for private equity investments. 
Mnuchin, a movie producer and financier before being tapped as U.S. Treasury secretary for the Trump administration, has raised about $2.5 billion at his firm Liberty Strategic Capital, according to people familiar with the matter. Most of the money is from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are private.
Liberty was founded this year with a focus on technology, financial services and fintech, as well as new forms of content, according to a statement in July announcing a $200 million investment in a cybersecurity business. 
A spokesperson for Liberty said the company won’t comment on ongoing fundraising, but it has “a diverse investor base including U.S. insurance companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors.” A representative for the Public Investment Fund didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The private equity fund marks a step back into investing for Mnuchin, 58, who was one of the rare cabinet members to serve the entirety of President Donald Trump’s four years of office. Prior to joining the government, he started a hedge fund and invested in Hollywood films including “The Lego Movie” and “Suicide Squad.” He also worked for 17 years at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
With his firm Dune Capital Management, Mnuchin led a team of investors that bought mortgage lender IndyMac during the financial crisis, using billions of dollars’ worth of government incentives. The bank was rebranded OneWest and sold in August 2015 for more than double the purchase price.
Relatively unknown outside the world of finance, Mnuchin saw his connections and prominence grow after becoming Treasury secretary in 2017. He managed to stay out of many of the controversial issues that embroiled much of the Trump administration, while helping to engineer tax cuts and the massive stimulus that spared Wall Street from what could have been a economic wrecking ball in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
While Mnuchin already had experience raising money and a reputation for being a savvy investor, the Trump administration’s close ties to the Middle East brought him nearer to some of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. He traveled to the region regularly, visiting countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates before leaving the government in January. In 2018, Mnuchin was one of the first Western government officials to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, chair of the Public Investment Fund, in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
With the return to finance, Mnuchin is following a similar path as Treasury predecessors such as Tim Geithner, who went on to become president of private equity firm Warburg Pincus. Hank Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive officer who led the Treasury Department during the financial crisis, is now the executive chair of TPG Rise Climate.
Former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner is also looking to raise money for his investment firm Affinity Partners.
Mnuchin is listed on a variety of entities tied to Liberty, investment advisory disclosures show, including Liberty 77 Capital Partners LP, Liberty 77 Fund LP and Liberty 77 Fund International LP. They appear to be a nod to Mnuchin’s prior job: He was the 77th U.S. Treasury secretary.

Horton Inc on Monday cut its forecast for annual revenue and homes closed, citing supply chain disruptions that included shortages and delivery delays in building materials along with tightness in the labor market.
The U.S. housing market, which had seen a pandemic-driven boost to its business, has over the months faced labor supply issues at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials, along with a rise in construction costs. 
The Texas-based company now expects homes closed between 81,300 and 81,700, from its prior outlook of 83,000 to 84,500 homes.
However, the company expects higher current-quarter home sales gross margin as limited supply of homes amid robust demand has led to an increase in prices. 
The homebuilder expects its revenue for fiscal 2021 between $27.4 billion and $27.6 billion, down from its previous expectation of $27.6 billion to $28.1 billion.

The company, however, expects minimal impact on its earnings.

Allianz (DE:ALVG) is facing a slew of investor lawsuits over its Structured Alpha Funds and related investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Germany's Bafin.
Allianz' considerations regarding its management revamp also relate to the asset management division, the German insurer said on Monday, adding that the supervisory board will discuss the matter at its next meeting on Sept. 30. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday that asset management head Jacqueline Hunt was in talks to depart.
Hunt's contract and those of three further board members are due to expire in 2022.
The various investigations and lawsuits revolve around Allianz Global Investor's Structured Alpha Funds, which catered to U.S. pension funds for workers such as teachers and subway employees. The funds were also marketed to European investors.
After the coronavirus pandemic sent markets into a tailspin, the funds plummeted, in some cases by 80% or more.
The losses from bad bets on options were so extreme that Allianz closed two funds in March 2020 which were worth $2.3 billion at the end of 2019. Losses at others caused some investors to withdraw what was left of their money.
Investors have now lodged 25 lawsuits claiming $6 billion in damages, saying Allianz strayed from its strategy of providing downside protection for market crashes. Allianz's lawyers have said the investors were sophisticated and aware of the risks.
Allianz also said that the company’s internal review of the matters relating to Structured Alpha cover a review of risk and compliance proceedings related to the Structured Alpha funds.

The German insurer is one of the world's biggest money managers with 2.4 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion) in assets under management through bond giant Pimco and Allianz Global Investors, which managed the funds at the centre of the probes.

BOSTON (Reuters) - NextGen Healthcare (NASDAQ:NXGN) Inc said on Monday it has hired healthcare information technology veteran David Sides as its chief executive officer, three months after his predecessor left. 
Sides joins the Atlanta-headquartered developer and marketer of healthcare information systems from Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, a telemedicine and virtual healthcare company, where he was chief operating officer and has worked since 2019. He will start this week and will also hold the title of president.
The appointment comes as NextGen, valued at $1 billion, is in the late stages of a bitter proxy contest where the board is facing off against the company's founder.
Earlier in his career, Sides spent 17 years at health information technology services supplier Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) where he was senior vice president for worldwide consulting.
NextGen's board chairman Jeffrey Margolis said in a statement that Sides was an ""ideal"" candidate and the company now has a ""powerhouse management team that defines what leadership should look like: continuing stability in operations and customer delivery, upgraded strategic industry knowledge, and a seasoned and experienced leader as CEO.""
Sides replaces Rusty Frantz, who left in late June after six years as NextGen's CEO and president.
Sides will run for a seat on the company's board, joining NextGen's slate of nine candidates.
Shareholders will vote on Oct. 13, electing either the company's nominees or company founder Sheldon Razin's four nominees. Razin, who has been a director since 1974, is not on the company's slate of nominees.
Razin has criticized NextGen's poor financial returns. Since January, NextGen's stock price has dropped 16.17% to close trading at $15.29 on Friday. The NASDAQ Composite Index has gained 16.73% during the same time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety investigators have opened a new probe into 30 million vehicles built by nearly two dozen automakers with potentially defective Takata air bag inflators, a government document seen by Reuters on Sunday showed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Friday opened an engineering analysis into an estimated 30 million U.S. vehicles from the 2001 through 2019 model years. Automakers were alerted to the investigation, which is not yet public.
The new investigation includes vehicles assembled by Honda Motor Co, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Ferrari  NV (MI:RACE), Nissan Motor, Mazda,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW Chrysler (now part of Stellantis NV), Porsche Cars, Jaguar Land Rover (owned by  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM)) and others.
The automakers on Sunday either declined to comment before NHTSA's expected public announcement on Monday, or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NHTSA declined to comment.
The 30 million vehicles include both vehicles that had the inflators installed when they were manufactured as well as some inflators that were used in prior recall repairs, NHTSA said in the document.
Over the last decade, more than 67 million Takata air bag inflators have been recalled in the United States -- and more than 100 million worldwide -- in the biggest auto safety callback in history because inflators can send deadly metal fragments flying in rare instances.
There have been at least 28 deaths worldwide, including 19 in the United States tied to faulty Takata inflators and more than 400 injuries.
The 30 million vehicles that are part of the new investigation have inflators with a ""desiccant"" or drying agent. According to the document, NHTSA said there have been no reported ruptures of vehicles on the roads with air bag inflators with the drying agent.
""While no present safety risk has been identified, further work is needed to evaluate the future risk of non-recalled desiccated inflators,"" NHTSA said in opening its engineering analysis seen by Reuters. ""Further study is needed to assess the long-term safety of desiccated inflators.""
NHTSA has said the cause of the inflator explosions tied to the recall of 67 million inflators that can emit deadly fragments is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity. The agency has required all similar Takata without a drying agent to be recalled. 
In the United States, 16 deaths in Honda vehicles have been reported, two in Ford vehicles and one in a BMW, while 9 other Honda deaths occurred in Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico.
NHTSA did not immediately release a breakdown of how many vehicles per manufacturer are covered by the probe.

The safety agency said the investigation ""will require extensive information on Takata production processes and surveys of inflators in the field.""
Earlier this year, NHTSA said of the 67 million recalled inflators, approximately 50 million have been repaired or are otherwise accounted for.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 07:32AM ET</span>",Special Report-BP gambles big on fast transition from oil to renewables,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Deep in the Oman desert lies one of BP (NYSE:BP)'s more lucrative projects, a mass of steel pipes and cooling towers that showcases the British energy giant's pioneering natural gas extraction technology.
The facility earned BP Plc more than $650 million in profits in 2019, according to financial filings reviewed by Reuters. Yet the oil major agreed to sell a third of its majority stake in the project earlier this year. The deal exemplifies a larger strategy to liquidate fossil-fuel assets to raise cash for investments in renewable-energy projects that BP concedes won't make money for years.
BP's big bet is emblematic of the hard choices confronting Big Oil. All oil majors face mounting pressure from regulators and investors worldwide to develop cleaner energy and divest from fossil fuels, a primary source of greenhouse-gas emissions that cause global warming. That scrutiny has increased since early August, when the United Nations panel on climate change warned in a landmark report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-ipcc-report-idCAKBN2FA0JL that rising temperatures could soon spiral out of control.
BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney, who took office in February 2020, is gambling that BP can make the clean-energy transition much faster than its peers. Last year, he became the first major oil CEO to announce that he would purposely cut future production. He aims to slash BP's output by 40%, or about 1 million barrels per day, an amount equal to the UK's entire daily output in 2019. At the same time, BP would boost its capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources to 50 gigawatts, a 20-fold increase and equivalent to the power produced by 50 U.S. nuclear plants. (For a graphic on BP's clean-energy investment plans, see https://tmsnrt.rs/3fbaCJP) 
To hit those targets, Looney plans $25 billion in fossil-fuel asset sales by 2025. That's equivalent to about 13% of the company's total fixed assets at the end of 2019. Under his watch, BP has already sold legacy projects worth about $15 billion. In addition to the Oman deal, Looney unloaded oil and gas fields in Alaska and the North Sea and sold off BP's entire petrochemical operation, which produced a $402 million profit in 2019.
Two of BP's key renewables investments, by contrast, are losing tens of millions of dollars, according to a Reuters review of financial filings with Companies House, Britain's corporate registry. BP owns half of Lightsource, a solar energy company that lost a combined 59.3 million pounds ($81.8 million) in 2018 and 2019, the last year for which data is available. The company's UK-based electric-vehicle charging firm, bp pulse, lost a combined 22.3 million pounds ($30.8 million) over the two years.
Performance figures for other assets recently bought or sold by BP are not available because, like other oil majors, it does not usually disclose financials of individual projects.The performance numbers for the two renewable projects and the Oman unit have not been previously reported. BP did not give Reuters updated financials for those projects or others beyond 2019.
The company acknowledged that its fast-growing clean-energy business - including its solar, EV-charging and wind ventures - continues to lose money. BP does not expect profits from those businesses until at least 2025.
The losses are not slowing Looney's spending on renewable energy. He aims to boost annual investment to $5 billion by 2030, a 10-fold increase over 2019. For bp pulse, that means operating 70,000 charging points by 2030, up from 11,000 now. Lightsource, meanwhile, recently completed a $250 million solar farm in rural north Texas and, separately, acquired a U.S. solar company for $220 million. BP is also moving aggressively into offshore wind power, and paying a high cost of entry relative to companies who got established in the business earlier.
As he launched the transition, Looney has slashed jobs, cutting 10,000 employees, or about 15% of the workforce he inherited. BP's share price, meanwhile, has fallen 39% since Looney arrived, the worst performance by any oil major during the period. (For a graphic comparing BP share prices to other oil majors, see https://tmsnrt.rs/3hhM0Ak) 
In an interview with Reuters, BP Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss dismissed the importance of the company's recent share performance and said BP and its investors can weather the rapid transformation. The declining oil-and-gas revenue this decade will be offset, in part, by higher expected revenues from gasoline stations and their attached convenience stores, he said. Those stations will increasingly offer electric vehicle charging, a business Auchincloss said is growing much faster than BP had expected, especially in Europe, because of plans by automakers including BMW and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, to introduce more electric models.
""Electrification is growing at a much faster pace than we ever could have dreamed,"" Auchincloss said.
When BP's wind and solar investments start returning healthy profits, Auchincloss said, the returns will be lower than BP expects from oil and gas. But they will be far more stable, he said, compared to the ""super volatile"" oil business, where prices can rise or fall dramatically. The company also plans to boost profits through its energy-trading operation, one of the world's largest, which will benefit from BP's new focus on generating electricity, Auchincloss said.
Seven current and former BP executives spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity and shared their views on Looney's transition plan. The executives generally supported the direction but expressed varying levels of concern that Looney is moving too fast in trading high-quality oil assets for more speculative renewable-energy investments. Some worried in particular that selling higher-quality oil assets now could leave BP with mostly lower-quality assets, which will become harder to unload later as the entire industry looks to transition to cleaner energy sources.
A recent attempted sale illustrates the increasing challenge of selling oil assets. When BP tried to sell two stakes in North Sea fields to Premier Oil, it slashed its price by two-thirds in negotiations, to $205 million, only to see the deal collapse entirely late last year when Premier hit financial difficulties.
One former senior BP executive said that Looney may have erred in setting a specific target for renewable-power capacity - one that would be difficult to meet while also hitting profit targets. Meeting those two conflicting goals will become harder as industry competition to acquire renewable assets heats up, said the former executive, who recently left BP. Missing either mark will not go over well with investors, the executive said.
A current senior BP executive countered that Looney, backed by company directors, has taken a bold but reasonable strategy to tackle the vexing challenges facing the industry. ""The board knows that you can't please everybody,"" this executive said, ""and the worst thing you can do is take no stand.""
BP spokesman David Nicholas said the company has been ""strictly disciplined"" in choosing renewable investments that meet certain financial criteria and will allow Looney to continue hitting corporate profit targets.
Looney faces a steep challenge in convincing shareholders to come along on what promises to be a wild ride for BP, said Russ Mould, the investment director for AJ Bell, one of UK's largest consumer-investing platforms, serving 368,000 people.
""BP is still looking to sell assets, at a time when demand for them is not great, and recycle that cash into renewable-energy assets, where competition for them is fierce,"" Mould said in an August note to investors. ""That sounds like a potential recipe for selling low, buying high and destroying shareholder value along the way.""
'BEYOND PETROLEUM' REDUX
Looney is a 50-year-old Irishman who grew up on a family farm in County Kerry with four siblings. He joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer and rose through the ranks of its oil-and-gas exploration and production division -- ""upstream"" in industry parlance -- before becoming its head in 2016. Confident and charismatic, Looney set his ambitions on ""reinventing"" BP as a green-energy provider when he took over the CEO's job from Bob Dudley.
Looney's transition may unnerve shareholders who recall BP's late-1990s foray into renewables -- the ultimately abandoned effort to rebrand BP as ""Beyond Petroleum."" Then-CEO John Browne was the first oil major chief to publicly acknowledge that fossil fuels contributed to climate change. He invested billions of dollars in wind and solar projects, only to see most of them fail over the next decade. Browne did not respond to a request for comment.
This time, BP is going beyond investing in renewables; it's unloading core oil and gas assets. The Oman project is among the world's largest natural-gas fields, and BP reported to Companies house that the field earned a 17% return on capital deployed in 2019.
When BP expanded the Oman project in October 2020 to boost its gas output, Looney called it central to BP's strategy. He has said he envisions natural gas, which has lower emissions of atmosphere-warming carbon than crude oil or coal, as a long-term revenue source to finance the company's metamorphosis.
Late last year, however, Looney faced rising pressure to steady the ship amid the coronavirus crisis, which sapped global fuel demand and crushed oil and gas prices. BP ended the year with $39 billion in net debt, a level that concerned executives including Looney, according to one senior BP executive with knowledge of their internal deliberations. The debt had become problematic because of the company's falling value, which increased its debt-to-equity ratio and jeopardized its credit rating. The concerns, the executive said, also stemmed from a difficulty in convincing bankers and investors that BP's growing renewable-energy business could make money.
In early 2021, Looney called a meeting of BP's top leadership and told them to urgently find ways to cut debt to below $35 billion, the executive said.
Soon after, on February 1, BP announced the agreement to sell part of its stake in the Oman gas field for $2.6 billion to Thailand's PTT Exploration (OTC:PEXNY) and Production. BP gave up a third of its 60% ownership - or 20% of the whole project - in the deal. That sale and others helped BP cut debt to $33 billion by the end of March. The effort was also aided by rising oil and natural gas prices.
Three current and former BP executives told Reuters that the company decided to sell the stake in such a profitable project because it struggled to find buyers for other assets during the pandemic, which left few firms with an appetite for acquisitions.
BP spokesman Nicholas said that BP had started planning to sell a stake in the Oman project before Looney launched the drive to cut debt.
In a brief interview at a company announcement in April, Looney told Reuters that he was happy with the price for the Oman stake and didn't sell it under duress.
""We're not in a panic here,"" Looney said. ""There is no rush; net debt is very much under control.""
Anish Kapadia, head of energy at the investor advisory service Palissy Advisors, said the price for the Oman stake was relatively low compared to comparable sales of natural-gas assets. Based on the project's earnings, Kapadia said he would have expected a value about 25% higher. BP also might have made substantially more money, Kapadia said, by waiting until the oil-and-gas industry rebounded.
""They're selling a profitable, long-life, long-reserve business,"" Kapadia said of BP. ""They're selling it and using those proceeds to fund alternative businesses that aren't going to generate free cash flow for the best part of this decade.""
Several months before the Oman deal, in June 2020, BP sold its petrochemicals business for $5 billion to chemicals giant INEOS. The business generated about 4% of BP's total annual profit in 2019.
Some other majors, by contrast, have targeted petrochemicals as a growth area and a hedge against expected long-term declines in oil demand. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have in recent years invested heavily in petrochemicals, which supply industries including plastics.
BP spokesperson Nicholas said the company had long ago, in 2005, sold a bigger piece of its petrochemical business to INEOS and only retained two specialist operations that were not integrated with the rest of BP. ""We sold for a very good price,"" he said, ""to a company that could integrate them into their business.""
Looney has often delighted in taking a different path - especially more recently, as the company reported strong second-quarter profits of $2.8 billion on the strength of its recovering oil-and-gas business. Looney has indicated, however, that the fresh influx of cash only makes him want to sell BP's oil assets faster - while it can fetch higher prices for them to finance more renewable investments.
""While we understand the questions in some investors' minds, we do see a compelling proposition to deliver competitive returns"" in renewable energy, Looney told investors on the August earnings call.
Mould, the AJ Bell investment director, said Looney's strategy may prove to be the ""least bad option"" facing BP and other oil firms under pressure to overhaul their businesses. Investors who buy BP shares at their current, beaten-down prices, he said, could see strong long-term returns.
LOSS LEADERS
As BP's fossil-fuel footprint shrinks, it faces a steep challenge in filling the financial void with profits from clean-energy ventures.
For now, BP's renewable projects are taking losses. The firm bought its bp pulse electric-vehicle charging firm - then named Chargemaster - in June 2018 for 130 million pounds ($179.3 million). The oil major hopes to boost the firm's fortunes in part by installing thousands of fast EV chargers alongside gas pumps at its large service-station network. The stations and their attached convenience stores have been a key profit driver, and BP is betting that EV drivers will shop and snack more while charging their cars, which takes longer than a gasoline fill-up.
BP announced a deal to acquire a 43% stake in Lightsource in December 2017 for $200 million. It now owns 50% of the firm, which operates solar farms in 15 countries and has tripled capacity since 2017 to 20 gigawatts.
Dev Sanyal, chief of BP's natural-gas and renewables businesses, said that solar-power businesses start delivering profits more quickly than offshore wind, where development can take much longer. But solar initially delivers lower returns than wind, Lightsource BP CEO Nick Boyle said in the 2019 filing reviewed by Reuters. The returns increase gradually, in part because solar has lower maintenance costs than wind facilities.
BP this week announced the appointment of Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, a veteran renewables and power sector executive, as its new head of natural gas and renewables, replacing Sanyal. The move was seen as further sign of Looney's drive to diversify away from oil and gas.
PRICEY WIND PROJECTS
BP moved aggressively into offshore wind in October 2020 when it bought a 50% stake from Norwegian energy giant Equinor in two projects off the U.S. East Coast for about $1 billion. Offshore projects, the industry's next frontier, are far more complex and capital-intensive than onshore projects and use newer technology.
Many top oil companies with experience in operating deepwater oil and gas fields have made a similar push. Some, such as Shell and Equinor, started their offshore wind ventures several years ago. Utilities such as Spain's Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) and Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) are also well established.
That stiff competition means BP is paying a hefty price of entry, some rivals say privately. In February, BP and its partner Energie Baden-Württemberg AG paid 900 million pounds ($1.24 billion) for the rights to build two projects in the Irish Sea in Britain's offshore wind licensing round.
BP's Sanyal acknowledged the high costs of entry. But he said the prospect of long-term power-supply contracts will make the returns more reliable.
""You don't have the highs and lows of oil and gas,"" Sanyal said.
It will be years before investors know the outcome of Looney's wager on renewables. Still, even BP's relatively fast transformation doesn't go far enough in reducing climate damage, said Kim Fustier, an oil-and-gas analyst at HSBC bank. She expects BP's earnings from renewables and low-carbon businesses to represent 4% to 5% of total earnings by the middle of the decade and 10% to 15% by 2030.

""This is nowhere near enough for investors to start thinking of these companies as being part of the solution,"" Fustier said.

The company said most of the available jobs were for full-time, part-time, and temporary licensed pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and nurses, adding that it was also looking for employees to help manage its retail stores.
CVS recently raised minimum hourly wages for its staff as retailers across the United States scramble to retain and lure more people back to work amid a nationwide labor shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
CVS, rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and other pharmacies that plan to administer boosters are likely to see more traffic between November and January, putting them under increasing pressure to hire and retain employees.
CVS said on Monday the virtual hiring campaign on Sept. 24 would help it administer the extra shots, pending regulatory approval, as it continues to offer COVID-19 tests as well as vaccines to those who have not yet been immunized.

The Biden administration had planned to make booster shots widely available in the week of Sept. 20, but advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week rejected broader approval of the shots, recommending their use in Americans 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness.
CVS, which has administered more than 34 million COVID-19 vaccines and over 32 million tests, said in March last year it would hire 50,000 employees to assist patients and customers during the coronavirus outbreak. It hired 15,000 more people in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 2% lower in Monday’s premarket on National Transportation Safety Board chief Jennifer Homendy’s comments that the carmaker should first address safety deficiencies in its full self-driving technology before enabling it for city driving.
Chief Executive Elon Musk last week said drivers would soon be able to request an enhanced version of what it calls ""Full Self-Driving"" capability. The upgrade aims to help vehicles navigate cities mostly on their own without the driver’s involvement, a feature that was so far limited to driving on highways.
“Basic safety issues have to be addressed before they’re then expanding it to other city streets and other areas,” she told The Wall Street Journal. Homendy also expressed concern about how Tesla software is tested on public roadways.
Homendy called Tesla’s use of the term 'Full Self-Driving' “misleading and irresponsible.""
The technology doesn’t make the vehicle fully autonomous. Tesla advises drivers to remain alert, with their hands on the wheel.
“It (Tesla) has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology,” she told WSJ.
Tesla plans to monitor the driving patterns of the customers who request the enhanced system and only give access after seven days of good behavior, Musk tweeted last week. Access to those who aren’t careful will be revoked, he said.
The country’s auto-safety regulator last month launched a probe last month after a spate of crashes involving Teslas’ Autopilot technology.
The investigation covers an estimated 765,000 Tesla Model Y, Model X, Model S, Model 3 vehicles.
While launching the exercise, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that since January 2018, it has identified 11 crashes in which Tesla models ""have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes."" There were cases of 17 injuries and one fatality in those crashes.
Tesla’s Autopilot handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods. Despite claims of launching a fully automated vehicle, the company's current technology only qualifies as ""level 2"" autonomy, on a rising scale of 1 through 5.

There are concerns that a default on its $300 billion of liabilities could crystallize broader risks in China's financial system.
Shares of metals and iron-ore have lately been under pressure as the world’s biggest consumer attempts to limit its steel output at last year’s level of around 1.05 billion tons.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday amid concerns about the health of property giant China  Evergrande  Group and ahead of the week’s crucial Federal Reserve meeting.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2% lower, following an increase in the number of constituents to 40 from 30, while the CAC 40 in France fell 1.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.3%.
This week sees a number of central banks hold policy-setting meetings, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, but the focus will be on the Federal Reserve, with the U.S. central bank potentially taking another step toward tapering at its two-day meeting, starting on Tuesday.
Investors will be looking to see if the Fed judges the U.S. economy to be sufficiently strong for it to start reducing the massive amount of monetary support it has provided during the pandemic, though the consensus is for an actual announcement to be delayed until the November or December meetings.
Back in Europe, sliding commodity prices have hit energy and mining stocks hard, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock down 1.2%, TotalEnergies (PA:TTEF) stock down 1.1%,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock off 5.9% and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock down 5.2%.

A massive week in monetary policy, with some 16 central banks holding meetings and possibly the first rate hike from a developed nation -- Norway. Not to say others will follow any time soon; the Federal Reserve for instance may strees its own rate rises remain distant. Others such as Switzerland and Japan are likely to stay resolutely dovish.
In the meantime, other sagas are focusing investors' minds. Chinese property developer Evergrande's inexorable journey towards default is pummelling Hong Kong stocks (mainland markets are shut) and has taken yields on Chinese junk bonds to 14%, the highest in almost a decade. 
So it's a firmly risk-off on Monday with European and U.S. equity futures down 1%, following Friday's dismal session when the S&P 500 plunged nearly to one-month lows and the VIX volatility gauge surged to a one-month high. 
Much of that is, of course, down to concerns for economic growth and inflation, the debt ceiling wrangling in Congress and persistently high COVID caseloads. 
Which takes us to the other issue of the day -- spiralling gas prices and the potential impact on inflation.
Already, these have forced some power producers out of business and shut fertiliser plants in Britain. Knock-on effects look inevitable, on sectors ranging from slaughter houses to supermarkets, alongside higher winter heating bills.

Pressure is growing on authorities -- Britain is planning measures to shield businesses and consumers and U.S. manufacturers are urging curbs on liquid gas (LNG) exports. Politics enters the picture too -- EU lawmakers have demanded authorities probe Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for market manipulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) plans to start producing low-carbon jet fuel at scale by 2025, in an attempt to encourage the world's airlines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Aviation, accounting for 3% of the world's carbon emissions, is considered one of the toughest sectors to tackle due to a lack of alternative technologies to jet fueled-engines.
Shell, one of the world's largest oil traders, said it aims to produce 2 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2025, a ten-fold increase from today's total global output.
Produced from waste cooking oil, plants and animal fats, SAF could cut up to 80% of aviation emissions, Shell said. 
Shell, which at present only supplies SAF produced by others, including Finnish refiner Neste, said on Monday it wants green jet fuel, which can be blended with regular aviation fuel with little need to change plane engines, to make up 10% of its global aviation fuel sales by 2030.
SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of today's global aviation fuel demand, which reached around 330 million tonnes in 2019, investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Growing the market faces several hurdles, primarily due to the cost of SAF, which is currently up to 8 times higher than regular jet fuel, and the limited availability of feedstock.
Shell said it wants others to follow its lead.
""We also expect other companies to add to it with their own production plants,"" Anna Mascolo, head of Shell Aviation, told Reuters.
The United States said last week it wants to cut aircraft greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% by the end of the decade by significantly boosting SAF usage.
Graphic - Global aviation emissions: https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-AVIATION/dwvkrdawmpm/chart.png
NEW PRODUCTION
Anglo-Dutch shell, which aims to reduce emissions from fuels it sells to net zero by 2050, is in the midst of a large overhaul aimed at producing more low-carbon fuels such as biodiesel and SAF, as well as hydrogen.
Shell plans to build a biofuels processing plant at its Rotterdam refinery with an annual capacity of 820,000 tonnes, with SAF set to make up more than half of the output. The plant is expected to start production in 2024.
In a new report on the decarbonisation of aviation published together with Deloitte, Shell called for the sector to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050.
The International Air Transport Association, representing most of the world's airlines, aims to halve emissions by then. 
Reducing emissions to net zero can be achieved by using more low-carbon fuel and offsetting the remaining emissions through carbon credits.

Shell is also developing synthetic aviation fuel made from hydrogen and recycled carbon.
""Sustainable aviation fuel, whether bio SAF or synthetic SAF, remains the single biggest solution,"" Mascolo said.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2021 02:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investors call for governments to toughen climate accounting - letter,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing more than $2.5 trillion have called on governments to compel companies and auditors to file financial accounts aligned with the world's net zero emissions target, a letter seen by Reuters showed.
Writing to UK climate czar Alok Sharma ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow in November, the group said doing so was crucial to clarify the financial impact of climate change and give an incentive to invest accordingly.
Governments should mandate a requirement for companies to make clear the financial consequences of a net-zero pathway and for auditors to call out where companies have failed to do so, the investor group said in the Sept. 14 letter.
It follows a recent study by Carbon Tracker and the Climate Accounting Project that found more than 70% of the world's heaviest-emitting companies did not disclose the full risks in their 2020 disclosures, with 80% of audits showing no evidence the risk had been assessed.
""Most (companies) continue to use assumptions that presume little or no decarbonisation, and thus report financial results predicated on governments failing to implement their stated commitments and, in some cases, legal targets,"" the letter said.
Sharma's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The upcoming climate conference, dubbed COP26, is seen as the most important since governments originally struck a deal to limit global warming in Paris in 2015, with all parties now being asked to accelerate their efforts https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/countries-emissions-pledges-still-fall-short-global-climate-goals-un-says-2021-09-17.
Britain's accounting watchdog has already warned companies and auditors to do a better job, while global accounting and auditing standard setters have restated the need to assess material risks, which can include climate risk.
Despite investor bodies representing $100 trillion in assets calling in September for Paris-aligned accounts, the inaction from companies and auditors meant government action was needed, the investor group said.
""If we choose to wait for companies to respond to investor pressure, it could take years to deliver the numbers we require to invest in a way that is aligned with the Paris goals,"" the investors' letter said.
Signatories to the letter include a body representing British local government pensions, Sweden's AP2 pension scheme and investors including Sarasin & Partners, which coordinated the letter and an accompanying position paper, as well as Candriam and Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI).
For countries like Britain, which have made reaching net-zero emissions a legal obligation, changing the law around accounting and auditing would be ""entirely consistent"" with other government efforts, the investor group said.

The stakes are high. Companies such as BP (NYSE:BP) wrote off billions of dollars last year after they lowered long-term oil price assumptions. Without proper accounting, money needed to fund the transition to a low-carbon economy could end up in the wrong place.
""Accounts that leave out material climate impacts misinform executives, shareholders and creditors and, thus, result in misdirected capital,"" the investor group said.

The week also sees a number of central banks hold policy-setting meetings, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank. But the focus will be on the Federal Reserve, with the U.S. central bank potentially taking another step toward tapering at its two-day meeting, starting on Tuesday.
Investors will be looking to see if the Fed judges the U.S. economy to be sufficiently strong for it to start reducing the massive amount of monetary support it has provided during the pandemic, though the consensus is for an actual announcement to be delayed until the November or December meetings.
Back in Europe, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will be in the spotlight after the German airline said on Sunday it would launch a capital increase that was expected to raise 2.14 billion euros ($2.51 billion) to pay back part of a state bailout it received during the coronavirus crisis.

Honda plans to add additional electric vehicle models as it aims to have sold a total of 500,000 electric vehicles in the United States by 2030, and to achieve 100% zero emission vehicles sales in North America by 2040.
It comes as President Joe Biden signed an executive order last month setting a target to make half of all new passenger vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles. 
The Honda Prologue is being co-developed with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and is based on the Detroit automaker's Ultium platform, a modular platform and battery system. Honda and GM are also co-developing an electric Acura-brand SUV.
GM will assemble the Prologue and the Acura SUV -- both of which will go on sale in 2024 -- but Honda has not disclosed which plant will build the vehicles or the name or volume targets for the Acura. 
Following the GM-built models, Honda will introduce a series of electrified vehicles through 2030 based on the Honda developed e-Architecture, a new EV platform led by Honda, and will assemble electric vehicles at Honda plants in North America.
Dave Gardner, executive vice president of national operations at American Honda Motor Co, said in a statement Honda will initially focus Prologue sales on California and other states like Texas and Florida.

He said Honda plans to add hybrid-electric systems to more U.S. models.
""Our strategy is focused on introducing a higher percentage of hybrids in core models in the near term, making a committed effort to achieve higher volume leading to the introduction of our Honda Prologue,"" Gardner said.

OSLO (Reuters) - Swedish energy company Vattenfall said on Monday it increased its emission reduction goals for 2030 and brought forward its net zero target by 10 years to 2040, by phasing out coal and increasing wind and solar capacity.
""The climate crisis is for real and not only do we have a responsibility to step up and move fast, we also see many opportunities for us at Vattenfall in being a leader in this urgent transition,"" Chief Executive Anna Borg said in a statement marking the start of the company's capital markets day.
Vattenfall's previous targets aligned with efforts to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, while the sharpened set of goals will match them to a 1.5 C target, it said.
The firm now aims to reduce the emissions from its operations, so-called scope 1 and 2 emissions, by more than 77% by 2030 from 2017, up from a cut of 38%.
It also raised its ambition for absolute emissions from use of sold products, known as scope 3, from a cut of 20% to 33% over the same period.
Between 2017 and 2020, Vattenfall said it had curbed emissions by 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) to about 12 million tonnes in 2020 and now eyed under 6 million tonnes in 2030. 
To do so, it will switch its last units powered by coal - two heating plants in Germany - to a combination of biomass, heat pumps, power-to-heat, and natural gas, Vattenfall said. 
It would also lift its current 3.7 gigawatts of wind and solar operations by four times and increase its electric charging points 25-fold from 2020 levels.
Vattenfall further seeks to help curb emissions outside its own business, by supporting the wider electrification of industrial processes, including in steel, cement, heavy transport and chemicals. 

""We also commit to a Net Zero by 2040 target, meaning we will achieve net zero emissions in our full value chain by 2040,"" Borg said. 
This also covers all CO2 emissions from suppliers and customers, which will either have been eliminated or offset via negative emissions certificates.

Hong Kong real estate giants including Henderson Land (OTC:HLDCY) Development Co. suffered the biggest selloff in more than a year on speculation China will extend its property clampdown to the financial hub. Fears of contagion from China Evergrande Group continued to intensify, dragging down everything from bank stocks to Ping An Insurance Group Co. and high-yield dollar bonds.
The Hang Seng Index dropped 3.9% at the midday break, its biggest loss since late July. The selling spilled over into the Hong Kong dollar, offshore yuan and S&P 500 Index futures. Holiday closures in much of Asia may have exacerbated the volatility, traders said.
Faced with uncertainty over how much economic fallout President Xi Jinping is willing to accept as he pushes forward with market-roiling campaigns to achieve “Common Prosperity” and rein in overindebted companies, many investors are choosing to sell first and ask questions later. Interest payment deadlines this week on several Evergrande bonds and bank loans add another layer of risk as market participants brace for what could be one of China’s largest-ever debt restructurings.
“The price action across several asset classes in Asia today is horrendous due to rising fears over Evergrande and a few other issues, but it could be an overreaction due to all of the market closures in the region,” said Brian Quartarolo, portfolio manager at Pilgrim Partners Asia.
 
 
The Hang Seng Property Index tumbled 6.6%, the most since May 2020. Henderson Land dropped 12%. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. slumped 9.1%, poised for its biggest loss since 2016. CK Asset Holdings Ltd. sank 7.9%.
Chinese officials told Hong Kong developers that Beijing is no longer willing to tolerate what it calls monopoly behavior, Reuters reported Friday. The officials didn’t lay out a roadmap or a deadline, the report said, citing unidentified developers.
“This is a paradigm shift,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International, referring to the Reuters report. “People need to keep a close look.”
Hong Kong’s government has long struggled to bring home prices under control amid outsized demand, limited supply and low borrowing costs. Hong Kong’s average property value was a world-beating $1.25 million as of June 2020, according to  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE). 
Risk-off sentiment in financial markets was widespread on Monday. Junk-rated Chinese dollar bonds slid by as much as 2 cents. The Hong Kong dollar fell to the lowest level this month. The offshore yuan declined for a third day. {{28930|FTSE ChChina A50 Index futures slid 3.9%. Mainland financial markets are closed for public holidays until Wednesday, when Hong Kong will be shut.

Evergrande is scheduled to pay interest on bank loans Monday, with a one-day grace period.

All eyes are on whether China Evergrande will be able to pay the $83.5 million interest for its March 2022 bond, due on Thursday. It has a second $47.5 million interest payment due on Sep. 29 for its March 2024 notes.
The bonds would default should the company fail to make the payments within 30 days.
China Evergrande has been struggling to raise the funds to pay its creditors, supplier and investors. Regulators have already warned that the company’s $305 billion in liabilities could spread broader risks to China's financial system if it is not stabilized. However, the prospect of a direct government bailout is unlikely as authorities are telling major lenders to extend interest payments or rollover loans.

The Chinese banks' measures, reported for the first time, show how financial institutions in the world's second-largest economy are bracing for a possible collapse of Evergrande. 
The developer epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, with nearly $305 billion in liabilities across loans, bonds, so-called trust products and money owed to contractors and suppliers, among others.
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) (AgBank), the country's No.3 lender by assets, has made some loan loss provisions for part of its exposure to Evergrande, one of the executives said, without giving details.
Meanwhile, China Minsheng Banking Corp and China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd, two other major Evergrande lenders, are prepared to roll over some of their near-term debt obligations, two separate sources with knowledge of each situation said.
AgBank, Minsheng, CITIC and Evergrande did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
In general, Chinese banks' exposure to Evergrande has fallen in the past year, and most of their outstanding loans are collateralized or guaranteed by deposits, according to the four sources. 
All the sources declined to be named as they are not allowed to discuss individual clients. 
Minsheng, for example, has cut its loan exposure to Evergrande to 30 billion yuan from 40 billion yuan over the past 12 months, one of the sources said, adding it also stopped offering new loans to Evergrande in recent months.
Last year, Evergrande reported total bank and other borrowings of 693.4 billion yuan ($107.4 billion) - including loans granted by trust firms rather than banks, which analysts said accounted for the bigger portion - down from 782.3 billion yuan in 2019.
Despite the retrenchment, an Evergrande collapse, even a managed one, would still reverberate through the Chinese economy given liabilities equal to 2% of the country's GDP.
The company's bank exposure is wide and a leaked 2020 document, written off as a fabrication by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed liabilities extending to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.
After that leaked document, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, requested all main Evergrande lenders to review their loan exposure and assess relevant financial risks on a monthly-basis, a source at a state-owned bank said. 
The PBOC and the sector regulator, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
ORDERLY COLLAPSE 
Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million of interest on Sept. 23 for its offshore March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million interest payment due on Sept. 29 for March 2024 notes. 
The bonds would default if Evergrande fails to pay the interest within 30 days.
Regulators have not given any indication to Chinese lenders of a possible bailout of Evergrande, said a source at one of the main trust creditors.
The editor-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Party-backed tabloid the Global Times on Friday warned Evergrande that it should not bet on a government bailout on the assumption it is ""too big to fail"".
Chinese regulators have in the past reined in domestic banks' unbridled lending to property companies, reiterated the need to curb property speculation, and emphasized the importance of deleveraging in the property sector.
It is possible the government may step in to manage an orderly collapse of Evergrande, said two banking sources familiar with the matter.

""And the regulators have done related risk evaluation among the financial institutions before letting it happen,"" one of them said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Some investors are playing this year’s tug of war between so-called growth and value stocks by owning companies that straddle the line between the two categories, as uncertainties mount over the U.S. economy’s trajectory in the months ahead.
Value stocks, which trade at comparatively cheap multiples of their fundamentals, surged in early 2021 as hopes of an economic rebound boosted the shares of banks, energy firms and other economically sensitive names after years of underperformance.
Their performance against growth stocks has varied since then, with signs of a flagging U.S. economic rebound tending to benefit growth names, which are less tied to the economy’s fluctuations and led the market for most of 2020. The Russell 1000 Value index is up 16.2% year-to-date, just behind the 18.6% notched by the Russell 1000 Growth Index as of midday on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up around 18% this year.
As a COVID-19 resurgence and a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve's easy money policies cloud the economic outlook, ""you're not seeing a great backdrop for the deep value or the mega-growth names, so we think you can find some great businesses in the middle,"" said David Marcus, portfolio manager of Evermore Global Value fund. 
Marcus is moving into companies like French media conglomerate Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SA, whose growth prospects he believes will improve after an expected spinoff of a stake in Universal Music Group later this month. On the value side, Vivendi owns a portfolio of economically sensitive media names and pays a dividend of 1.8%.

The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will conclude their meetings on the same day.
Some fund managers have also become worried over the comparatively high valuations commanded by growth stocks, which have helped boost the S&P's price-earnings ratio near its highest level since the 2001 dotcom bubble. 
Those concerns have led Matthew McLennan, co-head of the Global Value team at First Eagle Investment Management, to hold shares of companies such as logistics firm CH Robinson Worldwide Inc (NASDAQ:CHRW).
A broad recovery that increases the number of global shipments could benefit the company’s business, he said. At the same time, McLennan is betting that the company’s increasing market share and comparatively low valuation of 16.8 times future earnings will make it attractive if global growth concerns spur a flight to quality stocks. ""You don't have to chase the ‘glamour stocks’ that are quite expensive,"" he said.
The search for companies that have attributes of both growth and value comes at a time when analysts across Wall Street are dampening their expectations for stocks. 
Banks including BofA,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut back on their recommended exposure to stocks in the past week, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its forecast of U.S. economic growth in the third quarter on Aug. 19 to 5.5% from 9% due to the impact of the Delta variant. 
It is unlikely that an outsized rally in value stocks in battered industries like movie theaters and cruise liners, such as that seen during seen during the first three months of this year, will be repeated even if the Delta variant proves less disruptive to the economy than many fear, said David Park, portfolio manager of the Nuveen Santa Barbara Dividend Growth Fund. Yet at the same time, he doubts that growth stocks will resume last year's torrid rally because of their stretched valuations. Instead, Park is looking for companies like discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX), which he said has been taking market share from mall-based apparel stores. The company reinstated its stock buyback program in late May and resumed its dividend in December after cutting both in response to the pandemic, giving it a value tilt, he said. 

Its shares are up 3.2% for the year.
""We are usually stuck in purgatory because we can't invest in the highest-growth non-dividend payers and we aren’t interested in the lowest quality stocks either,"" Park said. ""We're ... waiting for more opportunities like this.""

793,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2021 08:27PM ET</span>",Evergrande Moment of Truth Arrives With Bond Payment Deadlines,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group bondholders are about to find out if the property giant’s liquidity crisis is as dire as it appears.
Interest payments on two Evergrande notes come due Thursday, a key test of whether the developer will continue meeting obligations to bondholders even as it falls behind on payments to banks, suppliers and holders of onshore investment products. Investors are pricing in a high likelihood of default, with one of the notes trading at less than 30% of face value.
Concern over Evergrande’s ability to make good on $300 billion of liabilities is spilling into China’s financial markets. Shares of other real estate firms have plunged, while the yield on an index of dollar-denominated junk bonds has climbed to about 14%, the highest in nearly a decade. The People’s Bank of China injected $14 billion of short-term cash into the financial system on Friday in a sign policy makers want to soothe nerves. 
The Evergrande payments due Thursday include $83.5 million of interest on an 8.25%, five-year dollar bond, Bloomberg-compiled data show. There is a 30-day period before a missed payment is considered a default, according to the bond’s covenants. Evergrande needs to pay a 232 million yuan ($36 million) coupon on an onshore bond the same day. 
In total, Evergrande has $669 million in coupon payments coming due through the end of this year. Some $615 million of that is on dollar bonds, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Fitch Ratings flagged the increased chance of a payment failure this month when it slashed the firm’s credit grade even deeper into junk territory, citing the risk of “probable” default. 
Evergrande is also scheduled to pay interest on bank loans Monday, with a one-day grace period. Monday and Tuesday are public holidays in China. While details on the amount due aren’t publicly available, Chinese authorities have already told major lenders not to expect repayment, people familiar with matter said last week. Evergrande and banks are discussing the possibility of extensions and rolling over some loans, the people said.
Bond investors are rushing to lock in professional help as a potential restructuring for Evergrande edges closer to reality. Addleshaw Goddard has engaged with some of the company’s bondholders and is preparing to establish a creditor committee to negotiate with Evergrande, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Separately, Evergrande kicked off a process on Saturday to repay investors in its overdue investment products with discounted properties. Investors who opt for discounted real estate in lieu of cash can start contacting wealth managers for more details, Evergrande’s wealth division said in a post on its Wechat account. 
More than 70,000 people bought the products, including many Evergrande employees, Bloomberg reported earlier, citing an executive of Evergrande’s wealth division. About 40 billion yuan of the products are now due, Caixin reported. 
Evergrande’s debt pile includes about 571.8 billion yuan of borrowings from banks and other financial institutions such as trusts, with 240 billion yuan due in less than one year. The average borrowing cost stood at 9.02% as of June 30. A portion of Evergrande’s borrowings was secured by a pledge of its properties and equipment, land use rights, cash held at banks and the equity interests of certain subsidiaries.
China Minsheng Banking Corp., Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (OTC:IDCBY) Ltd. were among the developer’s principal banks at the end of last year.
Whether the selloff in Evergrande bonds drags down the broader credit market may depend on the company’s ability to buy time with banks. A messy default on loans could stoke fears of widespread contagion, something Xi Jinping’s government has been keen to avoid even as it tightens financing restrictions on overstretched developers and discourages government bailouts.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",U.S. trade official called India's Mastercard ban 'draconian'-emails,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -A senior U.S. trade official privately criticised India's July decision to ban Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) from issuing new cards, calling it a ""draconian"" move that caused ""panic"", according to U.S. government emails seen by Reuters.
The documents show frustration within the U.S. government after India's central bank banned https://www.reuters.com/article/india-banking-american-express-idUSL4N2MG3I6 new card issuance by  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and Diners Club International in April, then took similar action against Mastercard https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-reserve-bank-bans-mastercard-issuing-new-cards-india-2021-07-14 in July.
The Reserve Bank of India accuses the companies of breaking local data-storage rules. The bans do not affect existing customers.
The ban on Mastercard - a top payment network in India alongside Visa (NYSE:V) - triggered a flurry of emails between U.S. officials in Washington and India as they discussed next steps with Mastercard, including approaching the RBI, the government emails show.
""We've started hearing from stakeholders about some pretty draconian measures that the RBI has taken over the past couple days,"" Brendan A. Lynch, the deputy assistant U.S. trade representative for South and Central Asia, wrote on July 16, two days after the Mastercard announcement.
""It sounds like some others (Amex, Diners) may have been impacted by similar actions recently,"" wrote Lynch, asking his colleagues in India to get in touch with their central bank contacts ""to see what's going on"". 
Lynch, spokespeople for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. government has not publicly commented on the Mastercard ban.
The RBI did not immediately respond.
A Mastercard spokesman told Reuters, ""We've had very constructive engagements with the Indian and U.S. governments over the past few weeks and appreciate the support of both."" This includes discussions with the RBI, and Mastercard has ""made good progress"" as it looks to resolve the situation quickly, he said.
""PANIC"", ""FULL COURT PRESS""
Mastercard counts India as a key growth market. In 2019 it said it was ""bullish on India"", a country where it has made major investment bets and built research and technology centres.
The Mastercard ban rattled https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-ban-mastercard-hit-banks-card-operations-income-sources-2021-07-15 the company and upset India's financial sector as Indian partner banks fear a hit to their income as they struggle to swiftly partner with new networks to offer cards.
The RBI acted against Mastercard because it was ""found to be non-compliant"" with the 2018 rules despite the ""lapse of considerable time and adequate opportunities"". 
The rules, requiring foreign card networks to store Indian payments data locally for ""unfettered supervisory access"", were implemented after failed lobbying efforts of U.S. firms also soured trade ties between New Delhi and Washington. 
Mastercard has said it was ""disappointed"" with the decision. The company has told Reuters it had submitted an additional audit report https://www.reuters.com/world/india/mastercard-submits-new-audit-india-after-ban-over-data-handling-2021-07-30 to the RBI before the ban took effect on July 22.
The U.S. government emails show there was hope things could be sorted out before that.

In one, Lynch told colleagues the understanding was that ""the RBI has info they need and are hopeful that they will respond appropriately."" But as the ban approached, ""if the RBI doesn't change course, I'm sure the panic will resume,"" he wrote.
Days later, he wrote that Mastercard was continuing ""to put on the full court press"" in Washington.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa said on Sunday it would launch a capital increase that was expected to raise 2.14 billion euros ($2.51 billion) to pay back part of a state bailout Germany's top airline received during the coronavirus crisis.
The subscription period for the widely-expected rights issue, involving the issue of about 597.7 million new shares, would run from Sept. 22 to Oct. 5, Lufthansa said.
The airline will use the net proceeds to repay a chunk of the 9 billion euro government bailout it received last year to stay afloat throughout the COVID pandemic, which resulted in the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) taking a stake in the group.
""We have always made it clear that we will only retain the stabilisation package for as long as it is necessary,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said.
""We are therefore proud that we can now deliver on our promise and repay the measures faster than originally expected. We can now fully focus on the further transformation of the Lufthansa Group,"" he said.
Lufthansa said that based on its operating performance in July and August it expected to post positive adjusted earnings before interest and tax in the third quarter.
Insiders told Reuters this year that Lufthansa was planning a capital increase of roughly 3 billion euros but Spohr has said lower pension liability had reduced the need for fresh capital in the past months.
A number of funds under the management of Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) have entered into a sub-underwriting agreement for a total of 300 million euros as part of the capital increase and have committed to fully exercise their subscription rights, Lufthansa said.
If it participates in the rights issue the ESF has committed to selling its current 15.94% stake in Lufthansa six months after the completion of the share sale at the earliest, while it will be sold no later than two years later, Lufthansa said.

""We also remain committed to further explore portfolio measures when full value can be achieved to maximize the value and strategic flexibility of the Group,"" Lufthansa Chief Financial Officer Remco Steenbergen said.

(Reuters) -The quartet of newly minted citizen astronauts comprising the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission safely splashed down in the Atlantic off Florida's coast on Saturday, completing a three-day flight of the first all-civilian crew ever sent into Earth orbit.
The successful launch and return of the mission, the latest in a recent string of rocket-powered expeditions bankrolled by their billionaire passengers, marked another milestone in the fledgling industry of commercial astro-tourism, 60 years after the dawn of human spaceflight.
""Welcome to the second space age,"" Todd ""Leif"" Ericson, mission director for the Inspiration4 venture, told reporters on a conference call after the crew returned.
SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc electric automaker CEO Elon Musk, supplied the spacecraft, launched it, controlled its flight and handled the splashdown recovery operation.
The three-day mission ended as the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, parachuted into calm seas around 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), shortly before sunset, following an automated reentry descent, as shown during a live SpaceX webcast on its YouTube channel.
Within an hour the four smiling crew members were seen emerging one by one from the capsule's side hatch after the vehicle, visibly scorched on its exterior, was hoisted from the ocean to the deck of a SpaceX recovery vessel.
Each of the four https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/profiles-first-all-civilian-space-crew-headed-orbit-2021-09-15 stood on the deck for a few moments in front of the capsule to wave and give thumbs-up before being escorted to a medical station on board for checkups at sea. Afterward they were flown by helicopter back to Cape Canaveral for reunions with loved ones.
SEARING REENTRY
The return from orbit followed a plunge through Earth's atmosphere generating frictional heat that sent temperatures surrounding the outside of the capsule soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius). The astronauts' flight suits, fitted to special ventilation systems, were designed to keep them cool if the cabin heated up.
Applause was heard from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles as the first parachutes were seen deploying, slowing the capsule's descent to about 15 miles per hour (25 kph) before splashdown, with another round of cheers as the craft hit the water. 
The astronauts were cheered again as they stepped onto the deck of the recovery ship.
First out was Hayely Arceneaux, 29, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children's Research Center in Tennessee, a childhood bone cancer survivor herself who became the youngest person ever reach Earth orbit on the Inspiration4 mission.
She was followed in rapid succession by geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42, and finally the crew's billionaire benefactor and ""mission commander"" Jared Isaacman, 38.
""That was a heck of a ride for us,"" Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, radioed from inside the capsule moments after splashdown. ""We're just getting started.""
He had paid an undisclosed sum - put by Time magazine at roughly $200 million - to fellow billionaire Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon. 
The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets. 
HIGHEST ORBIT SINCE APOLLO
Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of 585 km, or just over 363 miles - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972.
It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings.
Musk's company already ranks as the best-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the space station for NASA.
Two rival operators, Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and Blue Origin, inaugurated their own space tourism services in recent months, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, each going along for the ride.
Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's three days in orbit. 
Isaacman conceived of Inspiration4 primarily to raise awareness and donations for St. Jude, one of his favorite causes, where Arceneaux now works. Ericson said the flight had so far raised $160 million for the cancer institute, including $100 million donated by Isaacman at the outset.
The Inspiration4 crew had no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which was controlled by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, although Isaacman and Proctor are both licensed pilots.
But Ericson insisted the crew had ""the same training and the same control and authority that NASA astronauts have"" to intervene in the Crew Dragon's operation in the event of an emergency.
SpaceX's human-spaceflight chief, Benji Reed, marveled at how little went wrong during the flight, citing just two problems he described as minor and easily resolved - a malfunctioning fan in the crew's toilet system and a faulty temperature sensor on one of the spacecraft's engines.

The level of ""space adaption syndrome"" experienced by the crew - vertigo and motion sickness while acclimating to a microgravity environment - was ""pretty much on target with what NASA astronauts do,"" Ericson said.
All four had appeared relaxed and energetic during a number of live video appearances they made for Earth-bound audiences during their flight, from performing zero-G somersaults in the cabin to strumming a ukulele https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/all-civilian-inspiration4-crew-shows-off-zero-gravity-orbit-2021-09-18.

Investors' concerns over the regulatory crackdown has led to sharp sell-offs on China's share markets, reducing the market capitalisation of some of its largest companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Limited. 
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai explained during the meeting that recent actions were taken to strengthen regulations for companies with consumer-facing platforms, and improve data privacy and national security, the report https://bloom.bg/39iLhKH said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The three-hour meeting of the China-U.S. Financial Roundtable on Thursday included the head of the People's Bank of China, and executives from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) , Citadel and other Wall Street powerhouses, Bloomberg reported. 
The CSRC could not be immediately reached for a comment. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment while Citadel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology, gaming and private tutoring.
Fang said the regulator's actions in the education and gaming sectors were aimed at reducing anxiety in society, according to the report.

The Wall Street Journal, citing a review of internal company documents that included research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management, said that although Facebook researchers have identified ""the platform's ill effects,"" the company failed to fix them.
The Wall Street Journal articles say that Facebook exempted high-profile users from some or all of its rules, played down the negative effects on young users of its Instagram app, made changes to its algorithm that made the platform ""angrier,"" and had a weak response to alarms raised by employees over how the platform is used in developing countries by human traffickers.
Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs, writing in a blog post https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong, said the Wall Street Journal's stories ""contained deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do, and conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook's leadership and employees.""
Clegg called ""just plain false"" an allegation that ""Facebook conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are inconvenient for the company."" 

Facebook, Clegg said, understands the ""significant responsibility that comes with operating a global platform"" and takes it seriously, but ""we fundamentally reject this mischaracterization of our work and impugning of the company's motives.""
Clegg defended Facebook's handling of posts on the COVID-19 vaccine and said that the ""intersection between social media and well-being"" remains an evolving issue in the research community.

Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) thanked shopping mall giant Majid Al Futtaim for its commitment and said it would be given priority in government contracts.
Majid Al Futtaim, which generated 15.6 billion dirham ($4.25 billion) in revenue in the first half of the year, earlier said it would hire 3,000 Emiratis over the next five years.
“We have a collective sense of responsibility to support and upskill the talented and ambitious national workforce that exists in the UAE,"" Chief Executive Alain Bejjani said.
Around 411 of the 13,700 it currently employs in the UAE were Emirati, said the company, which is one of the largest shopping centre operators in the Middle East.
Majid Al Futtaim also operates in Africa and Central Asia and in sectors like hotels, real estate development and project management.
The government on Sunday announced it would spend 24 billion dirham ($6.5 billion) on benefits and subsidies to get 75,000 Emiratis into the private sector over the next five years.

Most Emiratis currently work in government roles where the pay, benefits and working hours are often better than the private sector where most positions are filled by foreigners.

U.S. President Joe Biden will host a first in-person summit of leaders of the ""Quad"" countries, which have sought to boost co-operation to push back against China's growing assertiveness.
The draft says that in order to create robust supply chains, the four countries will ascertain their semiconductor supply capacities and identify vulnerability, the Nikkei said, without unveiling how it had obtained the document.
The statement also says the use of advanced technologies should be based on the rule of respecting human rights, the newspaper said on its web site. 
The draft does not name China, but the move is aimed at preventing China's way of utilising technologies for maintaining an authoritarian regime from spreading to the rest of the world, the Nikkei said. 

The United States and China are at odds over issues across the board, including trade and technology, while Biden said in April his country and Japan, a U.S. ally, will invest together in areas such as 5G and semiconductor supply chains.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, using its ""huge financial muscle"" to illegally hurt competitors, the country's antitrust authority found in a report on its two-year probe seen by Reuters.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google reduced ""the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android,"" says the June report by the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) investigations unit.
The U.S. tech giant told Reuters in a statement it looks forward to working with the CCI to ""demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less.""
Google has not received the investigation report, a person with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment on the report. Senior CCI members will review the report and give Google another chance to defend itself, before issuing a final order, which could include penalties, said another person familiar with the case.
Google would be able to appeal any order in India's courts. 
Its findings are the latest antitrust setback for Google in India, where it faces several probes in the payments app https://reut.rs/2B9ODC5 and smart television https://reut.rs/30JTioa markets. The company has been investigated in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. This week, South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Google https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorean-antitrust-agency-fines-google-177-mln-abusing-market-dominance-2021-09-14 $180 million for blocking customised versions of Android.
'VAGUE, BIASED AND ARBITRARY' 
Google submitted at least 24 responses during the probe, defending itself and arguing it was not hurting competition, the report says.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as smartphone makers like Samsung (KS:005930) and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), were among 62 entities that responded to CCI questions during its Google investigation, the report says.
Android powers 98% of India's 520 million smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research. 
When the CCI ordered the probe https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-antitrust-exclusive/exclusive-google-appears-to-have-leveraged-android-dominance-india-watchdog-idUSKCN1TT1Q2 in 2019, it said Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers' ability to opt for alternate versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps.
The 750-page report finds the mandatory pre-installation of apps ""amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers"" in violation of India's competition law, while the company leveraged the position of its Play Store app store to protect its dominance.
Play Store policies were ""one-sided, ambiguous, vague, biased and arbitrary"", while Android has been ""enjoying its dominant position"" in licensable operating systems for smartphones and tablets since 2011, the report says.

The probe was triggered in 2019 after two Indian junior antitrust research associates and a law student filed a complaint https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-antitrust-idUSKCN1U40DY, Reuters reported.
India remains a key growth market for Google. It said last year it would spend $10 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-idINKCN24E0YL in the country over five to seven years through equity investments and tie-ups, its biggest commitment to a key growth market.

""Regarding the early redemption of Evergrande wealth investment products by some managers, the group company views the matter seriously,"" the company said. 
Evergrande said it had requested that all the funds redeemed by the six managers in advance be returned within a certain time frame.
Severe penalties would also be imposed, it said. 
Evergrande, with over $300 billion in liabilities, is in the throes of a liquidity crisis that has left it racing to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers.

The company has epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building. Uncertainty about its ability to meet funding obligations - equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product - has sent jitters through markets.
The group has been hit by recent ratings downgrades, with both S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings warning of the risk of default.

Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a warrant from the United States, charging her with fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran.
The United States is prepared to end an extradition request and criminal proceedings against Meng if she pleads guilty and pays a hefty fine, the report said, citing sources.
Both parties have been in talks for weeks, the newspaper added, citing two of its sources.
Huawei and the U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Meng, who has maintained her innocence and is fighting extradition, is confined to Vancouver and monitored 24/7 by private security that she pays for as part of her bail agreement.
Judicial hearings in her extradition case wrapped up in August with the date for a ruling to be set on Oct. 21.

Following Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians, sentencing one in August to 11 years in prison for espionage, in a move widely seen as retaliation.
The Globe and Mail report said the development could open the door for China to free the Canadians, without quoting sources. However, it said Huawei's talks with the United States did not include the Canadians.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 08:41PM ET</span>",U.S. FDA advisers recommend COVID-19 boosters for 65 and older after rejecting broad approval,"By Michael Erman, Julie Steenhuysen and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted on Friday to recommend COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for Americans 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness, after overwhelmingly rejecting a call for broader approval.
The panel also recommended that the FDA include healthcare workers and others at high risk of occupational exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19, such as teachers.
Despite the narrowed scope of the proposed authorization, the panel's recommendation would cover most Americans who got their shots in the earliest stages of the U.S. vaccination campaign.
""Today was an important step forward in providing better protection to Americans from COVID-19,"" White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz said. ""We stand ready to provide booster shots to eligible Americans once the process concludes at the end of next week,"" he said. 
The FDA is expected to make its decision on the third round of shots soon. It is not bound by the panel's recommendation but will take it into consideration.
Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the panel, said the recommendation was ""a step back"" from the Biden administration's recommendation of widespread boosters starting Sept. 20.
""That is not this. This is: 'We're going to test the water, one foot at a time,'"" said Offit, who voted ""no"" on the initial question of widespread use of boosters and ""yes"" on the more modest offering of vaccines for those at higher risk.
By a vote of 16 to 2, members of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee declined to recommend a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to anyone age 16 and older who received their second shot at least six months earlier.
The panelists suggested the evidence supporting broad approval was inadequate, and they wanted to see more safety data, especially concerning the risk of heart inflammation in younger people after vaccination.
The panel members then unanimously approved the recommendation for a third shot for older and other high risk Americans, convinced by evidence showing they were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and may be more likely to have waning immunity after the first rounds of shots. 
Advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are scheduled to meet on Sept. 22 and 23 to discuss further recommendations for who will be eligible for the shots.
""We wonder how well this restriction can be managed in real-world or how to stop people, but the point is - it will be available for those that need it,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) could still come back with more data to support a wider authorization or approval.
The drugmaker said it ""will work with the FDA following today’s meeting to address the committee’s questions, as we continue to believe in the benefits of a booster dose for a broader population.""
Pfizer shares closed down 1.3%, while BioNTech's U.S.-traded shares finished the day 3.6% lower. 
Some countries, including Israel and the UK, have already begun COVID-19 booster campaigns. The United States authorized extra shots for people with compromised immune systems last month and some 2 million people had already received a third shot, according to the CDC.

President Joe Biden has pushed for the additional shots in the face of surging hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, mostly among the unvaccinated, and rising cases of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated Americans.
Recent polls have shown that most vaccinated Americans want a booster shot to enhance their immunity.

Verizon said it would now offer trade-in subsidies of up to $1000, matching rival AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), from $700 previously. The biggest subsidies will be given to customers who turn in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models. 
Apple's new range of iPhones come at an unchanged price, but carriers are using aggressive subsidies as a way to hold on to existing customers and attract new ones.

The phones will also have custom 5G antennas and radio components for faster speeds. This push towards expanding 5G connectivity comes as telecom firms in the United States race to bolster their 5G infrastructure.
The iPhone 13, starting at $699, promises better display, longer battery life and a Cinematic mode for automatically changing focus while taking videos. It will come with a new A15 Bionic chip that enables features like automatically translating text. All models will be available from Sept. 24.

In a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the lobby groups said the proposal would create ""reputational challenges"" for large financial services firms, increase the cost of tax preparations for Americans and small businesses, and create serious ""financial privacy concerns"". 
""We urge members to oppose any efforts to advance this ill-advised new reporting regime,"" the groups said in the letter.
""While the stated goal of this vast data collection is to uncover tax dodging by the wealthy, this proposal is not remotely targeted to that purpose or that population."" 
The proposed domestic account reporting requirement in the $3.5 trillion House package is becoming an important issue for the banking industry, which is opposed to the tax reporting changes that are being pushed forward by the Democrats.

The new proposal will require financial services companies to track and submit inflows and outflows from every bank account above a minimum threshold of $600 during a year to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including breakdowns for cash.
The proposal also opens up significant privacy concerns, which the lobbyists said would discourage taxpayers from participating in the financial services system and undermine efforts to include vulnerable populations and unbanked households.

All three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground, with the Nasdaq Composite Index's weighed down as rising U.S. Treasury yields pressured market-leading growth stocks.
They also posted weekly losses, with the S&P index suffering its biggest two-week drop since February.
""The market is struggling with prospects for tighter fiscal policy due to tax increases, and tighter monetary policy due to Fed tapering,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
""Equity markets are also a little softer due to today's weak Consumer Sentiment data,"" Carter added. ""It's triggering concerns that the Delta variant could slow economic growth.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Friday it will send a team to investigate a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle crash this week that killed two people in Coral Gables, Florida.
Coral Gables police have said it is unclear whether the Tesla Model 3 involved in the crash in a residential area on Monday evening was using the electric vehicle company's driver-assistance system, called Autopilot. The two people killed were badly burned and have not yet been positively identified.
The NTSB, which makes safety recommendations but does not regulate automakers, said its investigation will focus on the operation of the vehicle and the post-crash fire that consumed it after it struck a tree. The agency said three NTSB investigators will arrive in the area on Monday.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The NTSB has previously investigated three fatal Tesla crashes in which Autopilot was involved. Autopilot handles some driving tasks such as steering, braking and acceleration and allows drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel at times but Tesla has said drivers must still actively supervise the vehicle when using the system.
Tesla vehicles have large battery packs that sometimes have been involved in lengthy fires after crashes.
The NTSB is also investigating an April Tesla crash in Texas that killed two people. Local police have said they believe that crash occurred with no one in the driver's seat.
Another federal agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has said it is gathering information about the Coral Gables crash but has not decided whether to send a crash investigation team.

The NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into 765,000 Tesla vehicles and Autopilot after 11 crashes involving first-responders such as police or fire vehicles. 
The agency also has opened 33 individual investigations into Tesla crashes involving 11 deaths since 2016 in which use of advanced driver assistance systems was suspected. NHTSA has ruled out Autopilot use in three of those crashes that were non-fatal.

(Reuters) - A former information technology executive at Mylan (NASDAQ:VTRS) pleaded guilty on Friday to insider trading for using tips from the drugmaker's chief information officer to trade in its stock, generating $4.27 million of illegal profit, authorities said.
Dayakar Mallu, 51, admitted to conspiring to commit securities fraud, and to an unrelated charge of helping prepare a false tax return, before U.S. District Judge W. Scott Hardy in Pittsburgh.
Mylan is now known as Viatris Inc after merging last November with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s Upjohn off-patent drug business, which Pfizer spun off. The combined company's headquarters remain in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh suburb.
Authorities said that between October 2017 and July 2019, Mallu traded Mylan stock based on material nonpublic information about the company's results, U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approvals, and the Upjohn merger.
Mallu, now a resident of Orlando, Florida, was previously vice president of global operations information technology at Mylan, and had been a friend and colleague of the chief information officer, court records show.
The tax return charge related to a computer programming company based in Farmington Hills, Michigan, that Mallu owned, prosecutors said.
Mallu could face 57 to 71 months in prison under recommended federal guidelines at his Jan. 24, 2022, sentencing, according to a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.
He also agreed to forfeit $4.27 million and make restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, court records show. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges.
Aitan Goelman, a lawyer for Mallu, declined to comment.
Ramkumar Rayapureddy, who was Mylan's CIO at the time of Mallu's trading, now holds the same job at Viatris, according to Viatris' website and his LinkedIn Page.
The SEC said Mallu shared some profits with the source of his inside information, who directed him to make cash payments in person, in India, to avoid detection.

Rayapureddy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, Viatris said: ""The company is committed to the highest standards of integrity and compliance with the law. The company has been fully cooperating with the authorities. We are not in a position to comment further.""

A panel of expert outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday voted to recommend https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-covid-19-booster-debate-moves-fda-vaccine-advisory-committee-2021-09-17 COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for Americans 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness, but rejected a request for broader approval. 
The application for boosters for all Americans age 16 and older had been brought by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) for the vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). Moderna, whose vaccine is based on a similar messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, applied earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-submits-initial-data-covid-19-vaccine-booster-us-fda-2021-09-01 to allow use of a booster dose. 
Moderna has benefited from being one of the dominant coronavirus vaccines, but its shares have pulled back 11% since hitting a closing high of $484.47 in early August. One factor in the rally stalling, analysts said, is a muddier outlook for additional booster COVID-19 shots, on top of the initial two-dose regimen.
“When (the stocks) ran up, I think it was expecting a booster shot to be given to everyone,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. ""Now I think it’s maybe a little less certain that that extra demand is going to be there.” 
The U.S. government had said it plans to start offering booster shots https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-start-offering-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-september-2021-08-18 widely as soon as next week. But experts have questioned whether there is evidence to back such a plan.
This week, leading scientists, including two departing U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials, said in an influential medical journal that additional booster shots are not needed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-not-widely-needed-top-fda-who-scientists-say-2021-09-13 for the general population. 
In a note earlier this week, SVB Leerink analysts estimated that the booster market is likely to add another $3 billion to $4 billion in U.S. revenue potential for existing vaccines. 
Substantial booster revenue for the companies ""are already contemplated in consensus estimates,"" the Leerink analysts said, ""making the stock impact for Moderna in particular dependent on the breadth of the recommended population and boosting interval.""
An already powerful rally in Moderna shares went into overdrive this summer, as index fund managers were forced to buy the stock after it was added to the S&P 500, and as concerns rose over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases due to spread of the virulent Delta variant of the virus. 
The stock has been volatile since joining the index in mid July, with Moderna shares being either the biggest daily percentage gainer or loser in the S&P 500 in 10 trading days since the stock joined - a quarter of all the sessions over that time.
(Graphic: Moderna's 2021 share price performance, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/MODERNA/gkplgwdnkvb/chart.png) 
Analysts overall appear to be cautious about the stock, even as the company is developing other products, including a vaccine that combines a booster dose against COVID-19 with its experimental flu shot https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-developing-single-dose-combination-vaccine-covid-19-flu-2021-09-09. 
The median price target for Moderna shares among 12 analysts is $391, according to Refinitiv, over 11% below Thursday's closing price of $440.65
Using earnings estimates for the next 12 months, Moderna shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8, according to Refinitiv Datastream. That is more expensive than the 11.4 times P/E of S&P 500 biotech companies overall, but cheaper than the 17.7 of the S&P 500 healthcare sector.

However, Moderna is also trading at about 15 times estimates of its sales in five years - a valuation level that large biotech stocks with one key product have peaked at historically, according to Hartaj Singh, a biotech analyst at Oppenheimer. Singh downgraded his rating on the stock to ""neutral"" in August. 
""I don’t expect the stock to go down unless there is some unequivocal bad news that comes across,"" Singh said. ""But I do think that a lot of the good news is already in the stock valuation.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World shares fell on Friday after a week of mixed economic data and fears over the stability of growth and Asian markets put the focus on the U.S. Federal Reserve's timeline for tapering asset purchases.
U.S. stocks ended sharply lower in a broad sell-off on Friday. All three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground, with the Nasdaq Composite Index weighed down as rising U.S. Treasury yields pressured market-leading growth stocks.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield briefly touched 1.3855%, its highest level since July 14, while the dollar hit a three-week high.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.9% for a third-straight week of losses. So far this month, the STOXX is down about 2%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.29%.
Investors hope the Fed's meeting next week will yield more clarity on its plan to slow down asset purchases, and when it might raise interest rates.
Shares in embattled property developer China Evergrande, which has two trillion yuan ($310 billion) in liabilities and faces an $80 million bond coupon payment next week, dropped 30% this week.
Concerns grew that a potential U.S. corporate tax hike could erode earnings as leading Democrats and President Joe Biden sought to raise the top tax rate on corporations to 26.5% from the current 21%.
""Fear seems to be creeping back into the market, and that can be a healthy dynamic, said Callie Cox, Ally Invest senior investment strategist. ""We wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback here.""

The 10-year Treasury note yield rose 3.9 basis points to 1.3702%.
The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro zone, was at -0.280% after rising as much as 3.5 basis points to a two-month high of -0.277%, after a Financial Times report suggested the European Central Bank expects to hit its 2% inflation target by 2025.
Stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data on Thursday boosted the dollar, which held steady near the previous day's three-week high against an index of currencies.

The euro down 0.32% to $1.1726.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>","U.S. senator concerned American, JetBlue partnership will raise prices","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has been outspoken on antitrust issues, expressed concern to the Transportation Department on Friday that a partnership between American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) would lead to higher airfares.
The airlines' ""Northeast Alliance"" partnership was announced in July 2020 and approved by the Transportation Department six months later, shortly before the end of the Trump administration.
The codeshare agreement allows American and JetBlue to sell each other's flights in their New York-area and Boston networks and link frequent flyer programs, in a move aimed at giving them more muscle to compete with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in the U.S. Northeast.
""I write with grave concerns that the recent joint partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways will lead to anticompetitive coordination at key air traffic hubs and result in the long-term inflation of airfares and related costs for airline passengers,"" Blumenthal said in a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Blumenthal urged a ""full public interest review and investigation of the Northeast Alliance cooperative agreement,"" noting that President Joe Biden had signed an executive order on competition in July. Blumenthal cited the White House as saying that the top four airlines had nearly two-thirds of the U.S. domestic market.
""I am concerned that the Northeast Alliance is exactly the kind of arrangement that has led us to this point and that will lead to even further consolidation in an already overly concentrated industry. Under the circumstances, this arrangement deserves more scrutiny,"" he wrote.
In a statement, JetBlue said the partnership allowed the two airlines to give Delta and United real competition.

JetBlue said its access to American's slots would mean that it could ""bring the JetBlue effect of lowering fares and stimulating demand to more routes in and out of the Northeast.""
The Transportation Department on Thursday said it planned to award 16 take-off and landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to a yet-to-be-determined low-cost carrier, and said it could take action to boost competition at other major airports.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound auto manufacturers Subaru Corp (OTC:FUJHY) and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY), which are trading at affordable prices. Let’s discuss.The current global semiconductor shortage continues to affect auto manufacturers, especially electric vehicle (EV) makers. However, governments have been taking steps, and enterprises have been making investments, to ease the semiconductor shortage.
Furthermore, the chip shortage, which has raised the prices of new cars, has led to increased demand for used cars. As a result, the average transaction price for a used car soared to $25,410 in the second quarter of 2021, up 21% year-over-year. Since the demand for vehicles is expected to remain high, with people avoiding mass transit to avoid encountering COVID-19, the auto manufacturing industry is expected to continue growing. According to Statista, 69.8 million cars are expected to be sold this year.
Given this backdrop, it could be wise to bet on the stocks of renowned auto manufacturers Subaru Corporation (FUJHY) and Mazda Motor Corporation (MZDAY), which are priced below $10 per share. They are expected to continue rallying in the near term based on their fundamental strength and growth prospects.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 04:06PM ET</span>",Analysis-Investors brace for a great fall in China,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - International investors that have been piling into China in recent years are now bracing for one of its great falls as the troubles of over-indebted property giant China Evergrande come to a head.
The developer's woes have been snowballing since May. Dwindling resources set against 2 trillion yuan ($305 billion) of liabilities have wiped nearly 80% off its stock and bond prices and an $80 million bond coupon payment now looms next week.
What happens then is unclear. Bankers have said it will most likely miss the payment and go into a kind of suspended animation where authorities step in and sell some of its assets, but it could easily get messy.
""We will have to see what happens,"" said Sid Dahiya, head of EM corporate bonds at abrdn, formerly Aberdeen Standard, in London, which holds a small sliver of the bonds.  
    ""They are probably working on a deal in the background, but we don't have any clarity and we don't really have any precedents, so it is uncharted water.""
Evergrande warned just over two weeks ago that it risked defaulting on its debt if it failed to raise cash. Since then it has said that no progress has been made with those efforts.
Analysts say the bigger picture is that if Evergrande - which has more than 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities - does topple, it will firmly dispel the idea that some Chinese firms are too big to fail. 
It would probably still apply to big state-linked firms of course, but it comes too after Beijing's clampdowns on big tech firms like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent wiped nearly a trillion dollars off its markets earlier in year.
Contagion from Evergrande has largely been confined to China's other highly-indebted ""high-yield"" firms which have also slumped, but Hong Kong's heavyweight Hang Seng also hit a 10-month low on Thursday showing there is some spread. 
There are big name global funds involved too. EMAXX data shows that Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, was the largest overall holder of Evergrande's international bonds, although it says it sold most of it before things turned really ugly. 
The Paris-headquartered firm had just under $93 million of a $625 million bond due for repayment in June 2025 and around $300 altogether back in March. It now holds $25 million in total. UBS Asset Management currently holds around $85 million of that 2025 issue and is also one of the bigger overall holders.
Amundi's Co-Head of EM Corporate & EM High Yield, Colm d’Rosario described the fundamental picture for many Chinese firms as intact ""For now, however, we await the commencement of a restructuring process (of Evergrande) to gather more information.""
""It remains to be seen the scale of loss that investors will face."" 
(Graphic: Evergrande's woe have had big knock on effect for indebted Chinese firms, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxodrzopx/Pasted%20image%201631781813184.png) 
UNWIND
Back in April Evergrande's bonds were trading around 90 cents on the dollar, now they are closer to 25 cents. 
""It was always priced as a risky high-yield investment but what prices are telling you today is that there was some surprise that the government would let it go fully,"" said the head of emerging market debt at U.S. fund Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management Jeff Grills.
He added it has been a text book example where investors had been lured in by the 10% plus interest rate the bonds had provided. 
According to the letter Evergrande sent to the Chinese government late last year, its liabilities involve more than 128 banks and over 120 other types of institutions.
A group of Evergrande bondholders has selected investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis as advisers on a potential restructuring of a tranche of bonds, two sources close to the matter said.
Other funds also exposed to the bonds include the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), as well dozens more such as Fidelity, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) asset management and PIMCO.
Major U.S. financial firms including BlackRock and Goldman, and the likes of Blackstone (NYSE:BX), are due to meet with officials from China's central bank and its banking and securities regulators later on Thursday.

Debt analysts hope though the damage might not be too widespread. The holdings are tiny compared to those big investment firms' overall size. Also only $6.75 billion of near $20 billion of Evergrande debt are included on JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s CEMBI index which big emerging market corporate debt buyers use as a kind of shopping list. 
Others are still wary though of the wider signal it sends. 
""This is part of a self-reinforcing dynamic in which rising insolvency risk sets off financial distress costs, which in turn increase insolvency risk,"" Michael Pettis, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said on twitter.
""Until regulators step in and credibly address insolvency risk across the board, conditions are likely only to deteriorate.""

Some veteran emerging market crisis watchers also think the troubles still have further to run. 
""This unwind hasn't even really started,"" said Hans Humes at EM debt-focused hedge fund Greylock Capital.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 03:52PM ET</span>",Growth? Value? Some investors opt for a bit of both,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors are playing this year’s tug of war between so-called growth and value stocks by owning companies that straddle the line between the two categories, as uncertainties mount over the U.S. economy’s trajectory in the months ahead.
Value stocks, which trade at comparatively cheap multiples of their fundamentals, surged in early 2021 as hopes of an economic rebound boosted the shares of banks, energy firms and other economically sensitive names after years of underperformance.
Their performance against growth stocks has varied since then, with signs of a flagging U.S. economic rebound tending to benefit growth names, which are less tied to the economy’s fluctuations and led the market for most of 2020. The Russell 1000 Value index is up 16.2% year-to-date, just behind the 18.6% notched by the Russell 1000 Growth Index as of midday on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up around 18% this year.
As a COVID-19 resurgence and a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve's easy money policies cloud the economic outlook, ""you're not seeing a great backdrop for the deep value or the mega-growth names, so we think you can find some great businesses in the middle,"" said David Marcus, portfolio manager of Evermore Global Value fund. 
Marcus is moving into companies like French media conglomerate Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) SA, whose growth prospects he believes will improve after an expected spinoff of a stake in Universal Music Group later this month. On the value side, Vivendi owns a portfolio of economically sensitive media names and pays a dividend of 1.8%.
Investors will be keeping a close eye on next week's Federal Reserve meeting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/delta-darkens-us-q3-growth-views-fed-taper-announcement-expected-nov-2021-09-17, which concludes on Wednesday, for any details of the central bank's plans to pull back its emergency-level support of the economy. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will conclude their meetings on the same day.
Some fund managers have also become worried over the comparatively high valuations commanded by growth stocks, which have helped boost the S&P's price-earnings ratio near its highest level since the 2001 dotcom bubble. 
Those concerns have led Matthew McLennan, co-head of the Global Value team at First Eagle Investment Management, to hold shares of companies such as logistics firm CH Robinson Worldwide Inc (NASDAQ:CHRW).
A broad recovery that increases the number of global shipments could benefit the company’s business, he said. At the same time, McLennan is betting that the company’s increasing market share and comparatively low valuation of 16.8 times future earnings will make it attractive if global growth concerns spur a flight to quality stocks. ""You don't have to chase the ‘glamour stocks’ that are quite expensive,"" he said.
The search for companies that have attributes of both growth and value comes at a time when analysts across Wall Street are dampening their expectations for stocks. 
Banks including BofA,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut back on their recommended exposure to stocks in the past week, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its forecast of U.S. economic growth in the third quarter on Aug. 19 to 5.5% from 9% due to the impact of the Delta variant. 
It is unlikely that an outsized rally in value stocks in battered industries like movie theaters and cruise liners, such as that seen during seen during the first three months of this year, will be repeated even if the Delta variant proves less disruptive to the economy than many fear, said David Park, portfolio manager of the Nuveen Santa Barbara Dividend Growth Fund. Yet at the same time, he doubts that growth stocks will resume last year's torrid rally because of their stretched valuations. Instead, Park is looking for companies like discount retailer TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX), which he said has been taking market share from mall-based apparel stores. The company reinstated its stock buyback program in late May and resumed its dividend in December after cutting both in response to the pandemic, giving it a value tilt, he said. 

Its shares are up 3.2% for the year.
""We are usually stuck in purgatory because we can't invest in the highest-growth non-dividend payers and we aren’t interested in the lowest quality stocks either,"" Park said. ""We're ... waiting for more opportunities like this.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Friday, led by material stocks following a slide in commodities while tech stocks were hurt by a climb in Treasury yields.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6%, or 201 points, the Nasdaq slumped 1%.
Materials stocks continued to add to losses from earlier this week, with mining stocks adding pressure following an ongoing rout in commodities including iron ore.
Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX), International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF),  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) led the decline in materials, with the latter down more than 4%
A fall in megacap tech stocks also weighed on the broader market, paced by a decline in Treasury yields.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were in the red.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury climbed to a more than one-week high, underpinned by positive economic data, and expectations the Federal Reserve is set to offer further clues on plans to tighten monetary policy at next week’s meeting.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to a reading of 71 in September after falling to 70.3 in August.
“We expect the FOMC to open the door to a possible November taper announcement, conditional on a solid September employment gain,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note ahead of the Fed meeting next week. 
With the broader market on course for a second-weekly loss, some on Wall Street continue to expect further pressure. 
“Investor sentiment getting more bearish after the shallow declines of early September: we remain on guard for further volatility ahead as we make our way through the Sept-Oct window. Watch 4400+ for initial support on the S&P here (around the 50-day MA),” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. 
Energy fell more than 1%, but remains on track to snap a two-week losing streak after strong gains earlier this week on easing fears about the impact of rising Covid-19 cases on energy demand.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 03:21PM ET</span>",England's COVID-19 travel rules simplified in boost to industry,"By Sarah Young and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain simplified rules on Friday for international travel to England in a boost to the tourism industry, including scrapping the need for fully vaccinated passengers to take expensive COVID-19 tests on arrival from low-risk countries.
Under the new proposals, destinations will simply be ranked low or high risk, instead of red, amber and green. Eight countries, including Turkey, Pakistan and the Maldives, will be removed from the high-risk red band from next Wednesday which requires passengers to quarantine in a hotel.
From Oct. 4, vaccinated passengers arriving from low-risk countries will be permitted to take a cheaper lateral flow test, rather than the privately administered PCR lab tests now required. PCR tests for a family now can cost hundreds of pounds.
""Today's changes mean a simpler, more straightforward system. One with less testing and lower costs, allowing more people to travel, see loved ones or conduct business around the world while providing a boost for the travel industry,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.
The British government sets policy for England, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own rules.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced months of pressure to ease the restrictions. Airlines and travel companies blamed the testing and complicated rules for the slowness of a recovery in air travel over the summer and warned https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-travel-sector-facing-new-wave-job-cuts-industry-body-warns-2021-09-14 that far-reaching changes were needed or more job losses would follow the 100,000 already lost.
The industry, already on its knees after 18 months of restrictions, is facing a cliff edge as a government furlough scheme ends later this month with winter approaching, when fewer people travel and businesses tend to make a loss.
RECOVERY LAGS
Unvaccinated travellers returning from low-risk countries will be required to take a pre-departure test, plus PCR tests on day two and day eight, and to self-isolate for 10 days on arrival, the government said. 
England will also expand the list of countries from which it recognises vaccinations, after the success of a pilot with the United States and Europe. Another 17 countries and territories will be added to the list, including Japan and Singapore.
Data shows that Britain's travel recovery is lagging. UK flights were down 39% compared with pre-pandemic levels for the two weeks to early Sept. 6, while France, Spain and Italy were down between 24% and 28%, according to Eurocontrol. 
The travel company Thomas Cook described the changes as ""a shot in the arm for the travel industry” while airline bosses, such as EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren, urged the government to go further by eliminating any screening of vaccinated travellers from low-risk countries.
The British Airline Pilots Association said the changes were good news for the industry. But workers in the sector would be among those most hurt by the end of the government's furlough programme, which has paid salaries of staff sent home during the pandemic and expires at the end of this month.

""But there is still a way to go before UK aviation can truly take off again and the industry remains precariously placed after a dire summer season,"" BALPA Acting General Secretary Martin Chalk said. ""With furlough ending it is going to be hard for cash strapped airlines to get back up and running as demand returns.""

840,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 03:17PM ET</span>",U.S. debt ceiling impasse? Fed's 'loathsome' game plan for the 'unthinkable',"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) -Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says failure to raise the U.S. debt limit could lead to the unthinkable: a default on government payment obligations. That's an outcome the White House on Friday warned could plunge the economy into recession.
If the impasse in Congress over the $28.5 trillion debt limit isn't resolved before an October deadline, what would the Federal Reserve - the backstop for U.S. financial markets as the lender of last resort - be prepared to do? 
As it turns out, Fed Chair Jerome Powell may already have something of a game plan. The country faced a similar crisis over the debt limit in 2011 and again two years later, and at an unscheduled October 2013 meeting, Fed policymakers - including Powell, who was then a Fed governor, and Yellen, who was the Fed's vice chair - debated possible actions in response.
'Loathsome' was how Powell described some of the most aggressive options contemplated, transcripts show, though he was among those who said they might be needed in the face of what could be a drastic market catastrophe.
'COME OUT SWINGING'
The plan included a process for managing government payments, given the Fed's expectation that Treasury would prioritize principal and interest but would make day-by-day decisions on whether to cover other obligations. 
Changes to the Fed's supervision of banks were also planned. Banks would be allowed to count defaulted Treasuries toward risk-capital requirements, and supervisors would work directly with any bank experiencing a ""temporary drop in its regulatory capital ratio."" The U.S. central bank would also direct lenders to give leeway to stressed borrowers.
Policymakers also mapped out approaches to managing market strains and financial stability risks stemming from a technical default. 
They readily agreed to some measures, including expanding ongoing bond purchases to include defaulted Treasuries, lending against defaulted securities and through the Fed's emergency lending window, and conducting repurchase operations to stabilize short-term financial markets. 
Other actions sketched out in briefing notes and during the meeting were more controversial, including providing direct support to financial markets buying defaulted Treasury securities, or simultaneously selling Treasuries that are not in default and buying ones that are. 
It was those last actions that Powell described as ""loathsome,"" while others referred to them as ""repugnant"" and ""beyond the pale."" The issue, transcripts suggest, was the worry that such purchases could be seen as crossing a line into direct financing of government.
""The economics of it are right, but you'd be stepping into this difficult political world and looking like you are making the problem go away,"" Powell said at the time. 
A larger number of policymakers, including Yellen and John Williams, who at the time was San Francisco Fed president and is now head of the New York Fed, felt that such an intervention ought to be part of the U.S. central bank's response if needed. Even Powell agreed it might need to be ""under certain circumstances.""
Congress resolved the debt limit impasse in 2013 and the Fed never had to activate its game plan. Since then it has managed through a number of crises, including the coronavirus pandemic, to which it responded aggressively and with never-before-used tools like purchases of municipal debt. ""We crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before,"" Powell said in an interview in May 2020.
Analysts say that the Fed helped stave off a financial crisis and an even worse economic downturn. 

Christopher Russo, a post-graduate research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says the Fed's experience may color how it responds to future crises.
""The lesson learned is: if they are going to do something, come out swinging,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra said Friday the largest U.S. automaker plans to make changes in its supply chain as it works to address the continuing semiconductor chip crisis that has forced significant production cuts.
""We're going to make some pretty substantial shifts in our supply chain,"" Barra said in an online interview. ""We're already working much deeper into the tiered supply base because generally General Motors doesn't buy chips (directly) but (our suppliers do). But now we're building direct relationships with the manufacturers.""
A GM spokesman declined to comment further on how the company might shift its supply chain.
Next week, the White House and the U.S. Commerce Department plan a meeting on the chip crisis, which has caused production cuts by automakers around the world.
On Thursday, GM said it was cutting production at six North American assembly plants due to the shortage.
Earlier this month, the company was forced to temporarily halt production at most North American assembly plants because of the shortage.
Chrysler parent Stellantis NV said this week it was cutting additional production at three plants in the United States and Canada because of the shortage.
Barra said Friday the issue is a ""solvable problem, but it's going to be here a little longer.""
The GM CEO, interviewed by Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) chief Ed Bastian as part of a series of discussions with fellow CEOs, said some newer GM vehicles have up to 30% more chips than other vehicles. 
""As customer needs are shifting, we need more and more semiconductors,"" Barra said, saying GM was looking for short-, medium- and long-term solutions to the shortage. 

Last week, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson reaffirmed the automaker's 2021 profit outlook and said the company expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for semiconductor supplies.
Jacobson cautioned GM's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages and because GM shifted production into the second quarter as it managed semiconductor supplies.

MADRID (Reuters) -Naturgy said on Friday its main shareholders will not tender their shares, although its board considers the 4.9 billion euros ($5.76 billion) bid from the Australian fund IFM to acquire a 22.69% stake in the Spanish energy group to be reasonable.
The bid is subject to securing at least 17% in the Spanish energy group, although IFM said in its prospectus filed last week it could decide to lower the minimum threshold to 10%.
The three main shareholders in Naturgy hold more than a combined 67% of the energy group.
The energy group said in a filing that from a financial point of view and in the current circumstances, the price of the offer is reasonable but it added that it had to also assess the possible impact on corporate governance, without giving any details.
In its prospectus filed last week, IFM said it intended to appoint two board members without increasing the overall number of the current 12 executives on Naturgy's board.
After stripping out dividend payments, IFM is offering 22.07 euros per share, down from an original 23 euros per share offer. Shares in Naturgy closed on Friday at 21.590 euros.
A source with knowledge of the matter said that taking into account stakes held by some board members in Naturgy, treasury stock and a 3.85% stake held by Algeria's state-owned oil company Sonatrach, which is aligned with the board's assessment, more than 70% of Naturgy's shareholders would not sell.
Besides Criteria, which currently holds almost 26% in the energy group, Naturgy's main shareholders are private equity funds CVC and GIP with stakes of 20.7% and 20.64%, respectively.
Criteria, the main shareholder of Caixabank, is fully owned by the foundation of former savings bank La Caixa.
Naturgy's shareholders have until Oct. 8 to accept the offer.
In its filing to the supervisor, Naturgy also warned that its shares could be negatively impacted, like peers Endesa and Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), by measures approved by the government this week to redirect billions of euros in extraordinary profits from the industry to consumers.

IFM said in a statement its offer was ""excellent news"" for Naturgy shareholders particularly when current regulatory uncertainty was causing the weak performance of Naturgy's competitors' shares. 
""While the sector is in decline, and the share prices of Naturgy's main competitors underperform, Naturgy's shareholders can benefit from IFM's attractive GIF Offering,"" it added.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has agreed to cut prices or reschedule delivery for hundreds of jets ordered by Malaysia's AirAsia to salvage a contract worth tens of billions of dollars with its largest Asian customer, industry sources said on Friday.
The restructuring deal resets relations between two of the industry's closest partners, torn apart by the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis, and lifts uncertainty over the fate of up to 400 A320-family single-aisle jets yet to be delivered.
Airbus declined comment, while AirAsia did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The AirAsia deal does not involve cancelling jets on order but includes a new delivery schedule and price cuts or other improvements in terms, the sources said.
AirAsia said last year it would stop taking deliveries of all Airbus jets and review remaining orders.
Industry sources said it had also stopped sending progress payments to Airbus, prompting the planemaker to suspend plans to produce jets on order pending the new restructuring deal.
The deal comes as other airlines in Asia that have ordered hundreds of jets to secure their growth are in the midst of restructuring or are expected to press for relief.

Other suppliers are also expected to come under pressure to negotiate new conditions, one of the sources said.

(Reuters) - Top U.S. shale oil producer  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co has put its assets in the Delaware basin of Texas on the block, aiming to secure more than $2 billion for the properties, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. A strong rebound in crude oil prices following last year's pandemic-led crash has sparked a wave of shale consolidation and opened a window for producers to offload unwanted properties. Pioneer wants to streamline its business and reduce debt after two big acquisitions this year. In March, it sold an oilfield services business for an undisclosed amount.

There was no guarantee Pioneer would end up striking a deal. The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A sale would leave Pioneer focused on the Midland portion of the Permian, its traditional base. The assets now for sale were acquired with its $4.5 billion purchase of  Parsley Energy  (NYSE:PE), the sources said. Parsley has about 350 wells across four counties in the Delaware Basin. Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield last week told investors the company likely would divest some of its less-productive acreage in the Delaware and Midland basins in Texas. Pioneer this year completed two multi-billion dollar takeovers. After closing its Parsley deal in January, Pioneer paid $6.2 billion deal for Midland-basin rival DoublePoint Energy. The deals pushed Pioneer's total debt to $6.9 billion at the end of June, from $3.1 billion six months earlier, according to regulatory filings. As part of the wider industry focus to improve investor sentiment after years of sub-standard returns versus other economic sectors, U.S. shale firms have been boosting buybacks and dividends. Last month, Pioneer said it was bringing forward plans to start paying a variable quarterly dividend to September, from the first quarter of 2022.

Excerpts of the interview were made available on Friday, ahead of its publication on Sunday.
Daum said that order books were filled but due to the shortage which was hit all major carmakers, stockpiles had gone up massively.
""There are significant inventories of already produced vehicles where essential parts are lacking. Those vehicles are badly needed by our customers. We would like to deliver but we are waiting for the parts.""

The amber and green lists of countries are being merged. This will also enable double-jabbed Britons’ quarantine-free travel to other countries. The red category, for countries the government advises against visiting, remains though that has been pruned.
Those travelling from red-list countries will have to book a day-two Covid test, to be taken after arrival in England. A passenger travelling from any country not mentioned in the lists will be treated as unvaccinated, even if fully-vaccinated.
The new system aims to reduce testing and costs for people, allowing more people to travel, BBC quoted Transport Secretary Grant Shapps as saying.
A person showing positive after a lateral flow test will be asked to take a second follow-up PCR lab test, which will be paid for by the NHS.
The restrictions have been simplified to aid the tourist industry, ahead of the autumn half-term break at the end of October.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on financially strong cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings (OTC:CURLF), Turalieve Cannabis (TCNNF (OTC:TCNNF)), and Ay Wellness (AYRWF). Let’s discuss these names.The cannabis industry’s changing legal landscape in the United States and the growing awareness surrounding the medicinal benefits of marijuana have created a favorable backdrop for companies operating in this space. Because cannabis-based medicines are now being widely recognized as viable treatment options for people suffering from chronic pain or seizures, the industry’s sales are expected to increase this year and beyond.
The cannabis market is anticipated to reach $70.6 billion by 2028, growing at a 26.7% CAGR. With more states legalizing the use and sale of recreational marijuana, cannabis producers’ addressable market continues to grow. In addition, cannabis’ potential decriminalization at the federal level could be a massive opportunity for industry players because it would afford them access to some of the world’s largest investors.
Given this backdrop, we think fundamentally strong cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings Inc. (CURLF), Turalieve Cannabis Corp. (TCNNF), and Ayr Wellness Inc. (AYRWF) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds and gain significantly in the near term.

However, amid inflationary pressure, we think it could be wise to closely watch quality ETFs Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping (BDRY) and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas (BOIL). These funds’ shares have tripled in price this year.The stock market has rallied relentlessly this year, fueled by a torrent of monetary and fiscal stimulus and strong corporate earnings. Though a broader market sell-off was seen last week on investors’ concerns over the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of COVID-19, a better-than-expected U.S. retail sales report, boosted by back-to-school shopping and government payments of child tax credits, could ease expectations of a dramatic downturn in economic growth in the third quarter, and push the stock market higher in the coming weeks.
With the inflationary pressure in mind, betting on commodity ETFs could be an ideal strategy for now because they have proven to be resilient amid inflationary pressure and they help diversify investment portfolios.

However, with mixed analyst sentiment, will the stock be able to maintain this momentum? Read more to find out.Headquartered in Chile, Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) produces lithium and its derivatives, iodine, and various specialty plant nutrients. The company’s lithium products have applications in electrochemical materials for batteries that power electric vehicles (EVs).

Lithium prices hit three-year highs on September 13, fueled by rising demand from the EV industry. Analysts predict a global lithium shortage soon, given its limited supply and rising demand for the metal amid the mass adoption of EVs in major economies. Regarding this, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence Analyst George Miller said, “Things are heating up and there is huge anxiety about where lithium supply is going to come from in the near future.”
Because countries worldwide are investing heavily to phase out fossil-fuel-powered vehicles and replace them with EVs, the demand for lithium is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Consequently, surging lithium prices should boost SQM’s profit margins substantially in the near term.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 12:12PM ET</span>","Banks beware, outsiders are cracking the code for finance","By Anna Irrera and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Anyone can be a banker these days, you just need the right code.
Global brands from Mercedes and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to IKEA and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are cutting out the traditional financial middleman and plugging in software from tech startups to offer customers everything from banking and credit to insurance.
For established financial institutions, the warning signs are flashing.
So-called embedded finance - a fancy term for companies integrating software to offer financial services - means Amazon can let customers ""buy now pay later"" when they check out and Mercedes drivers can get their cars to pay for their fuel.
To be sure, banks are still behind most of the transactions but investors and analysts say the risk for traditional lenders is that they will get pushed further away from the front end of the finance chain.
And that means they'll be further away from the mountains of data others are hoovering up about the preferences and behaviours of their customers - data that could be crucial in giving them an edge over banks in financial services.
""Embedded financial services takes the cross-sell concept to new heights. It's predicated on a deep software-based ongoing data relationship with the consumer and business,"" said Matt Harris, a partner at investor Bain Capital Ventures.
""That is why this revolution is so important,"" he said. ""It means that all the good risk is going to go to these embedded companies that know so much about their customers and what is left over will go to banks and insurance companies.""
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?
For now, many areas of embedded finance are barely denting the dominance of banks and even though some upstarts have licences to offer regulated services such as lending, they lack the scale and deep funding pools of the biggest banks.
But if financial technology firms, or fintechs, can match their success in grabbing a chunk of digital payments from banks - and boosting their valuations in the process - lenders may have to respond, analysts say.
Stripe, for example, the payments platform behind many sites with clients including Amazon and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, was valued at $95 billion in March.
Accenture (NYSE:ACN) estimated in 2019 that new entrants to the payments market had amassed 8% of revenues globally - and that share has risen over the past year as the pandemic boosted digital payments and hit traditional payments, Alan McIntyre, senior banking industry director at Accenture, said.
Now the focus is turning to lending, as well as complete off-the-shelf digital lenders with a variety of products businesses can pick and choose to embed in their processes.
""The vast majority of consumer centric companies will be able to launch financial products that will allow them to significantly improve their customer experience,"" said Luca Bocchio, partner at venture capital firm Accel. 
""That is why we feel excited about this space.""
So far this year, investors have poured $4.25 billion into embedded finance startups, almost three times the amount in 2020, data provided to Reuters by PitchBook shows.
Leading the way is Swedish buy now pay later (BNPL) firm Klarna which raised $1.9 billion. 
DriveWealth, which sells technology allowing companies to offer fractional share trading, attracted $459 million while investors put $229 million into Solarisbank, a licensed German digital bank which offers an array of banking services software.
Shares in Affirm, meanwhile, surged last month when it teamed up with Amazon to offer BNPL products while rival U.S. fintech Square said last month it was buying Australian BNPL firm Afterpay for $29 billion.
Square is now worth $113 billion, more than Europe's most valuable bank, HSBC, on $105 billion. 
""Big banks and insurers will lose out if they don't act quickly and work out where to play in this market,"" said Simon Torrance, founder of Embedded Finance & Super App Strategies. 
Venture capital investment in embedded finance leaps https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-EMBEDDEDFINANCE/jnvweemkgvw/chart.png 
YOU NEED A LOAN!
Several other retailers have announced plans this year to expand in financial services. 
Walmart launched a fintech startup with investment firm Ribbit Capital in January to develop financial products for its employees and customers while IKEA took a minority stake in BNPL firm Jifiti last month.
Automakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Audi and Tata's Jaguar Land Rover have experimented with embedding payment technology in their vehicles to take the hassle out of paying, besides Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes. 
""Customers expect services, including financial services, to be directly integrated at the point of consumption, and to be convenient, digital, and immediately accessible,"" said Roland Folz, chief executive of Solarisbank which provides banking services to more than 50 companies including Samsung (KS:005930).
It's not just end consumers being targeted by embedded finance startups. Businesses themselves are being tapped on the shoulder as their digital data is crunched by fintechs such as Canada's Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).
It provides software for merchants and its Shopify Capital division also offers cash advances, based on an analysis of more than 70 million data points across its platform. 
""No merchant comes to us and says, I would like a loan. We go to merchants and say, we think it's time for funding for you,"" said Kaz Nejatian, vice president, product, merchant services at Shopify. 
""We don't ask for business plans, we don't ask for tax statements, we don't ask for income statements, and we don't ask for personal guarantees. Not because we are benevolent but because we think those are bad signals into the odds of success on the internet,"" he said. 
A Shopify spokesperson said funding goes from $200 to $2 million. It has provided $2.3 billion in cumulative capital advances and is valued at $184 billion, well above Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest traditional lender.
CONNECTED FUTURE?
Shopify's lending business is, however, still dwarfed by the big banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), for example, had a consumer and community loan book worth $435 billion at the end of June.
Major advances into finance by companies from other sectors could also be limited by regulators.
Officials from the Bank for International Settlements, a consortium of central banks and financial regulators, warned watchdogs last month to get to grips with the growing influence of technology firms in finance.
Bain's Harris said financial regulators were taking the approach that because they don't know how to regulate tech firms they are insisting there's a bank behind every transaction - but that did not mean banks would prevent fintechs encroaching.
""They are right that the banks will always have a role but it's not a very remunerative role and it involves very little ownership of the customer,"" he said.
Forrester analyst Jacob Morgan said banks had to decide where they want to be in the finance chain.

""Can they afford to fight for customer primacy, or do they actually see a more profitable route to market to become the rails that other people run on top of?"" he said. ""Some banks will choose to do both."" And some are already fighting back.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) has teamed up with Google on bank accounts, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is providing credit cards for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and JPMorgan is buying 75% of Volkswagen's payments business and plans to expand to other industries. 06:00:00 ""Connectivity between different systems is the future,"" said Shahrokh Moinian, head of wholesale payments, EMEA, at JPMorgan. ""We want to be the leader.""

Investing.com – Five9 stock (NASDAQ:FIVN) rose 3% Friday as Piper Sandler upgraded the stock to overweight on prospects of Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) offering a higher price to buy the cloud-based customer-service software provider.
At the same time, analyst James Fish cut his target for Five9 by $3 to $200, still almost 16% above the current level of $173. Zoom traded 1.6% higher.
As per the July 18 all-stock offer, Five9 stockholders will receive 0.55 shares of Zoom for each share of the company they hold. This represents a per share price for Five9 stock of $200.28 and values the company at $13.56 billion.
The acquisition is expected to enhance Zoom’s presence with enterprise customers and help the video conferencing service target the $24 billion contact center market.
Five9 is a pioneer of cloud-based contact center software. Its cloud contact center offers applications that allow management of customer interactions across many channels.
The acquisition is complementary to the growing popularity of Zoom's cloud-based phone system that offers a digital alternative to traditional phone systems in offices, Zoom said in its note announcing the offer.
Fish’s report comes after proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the Zoom deal.
Though the combined company will have access to a larger market, ISS said, ""The all-stock deal exposes Five9 shareholders to a more volatile stock whose growth prospects have become less compelling as society inches towards a post-pandemic environment.""
Since the deal was announced, Zoom shares have lost more than 20% of their value, while Five9 has eroded by about 5%."

859,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Amazon faces Teamsters union drive at nine Canadian sites,"By Julia Love and Moira Warburton
(Reuters) -The Teamsters Union has launched campaigns to organize employees in at least nine Canadian facilities of U.S. e-commerce company Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to Reuters interviews with union officials.
The influential union took the first step earlier this week to organize employees at one of Amazon's Canadian facilities, and the interviews reveal it is widening such efforts across the country, where the e-commerce company employs about 25,000 workers and plans to add 15,000 more.
The campaigns could be seen as a bet by the Teamsters that early success unionizing employees in a more labor-friendly market such as Canada will inspire similar results south of the border, where Amazon has so far fended off unionization attempts. 
In the latest challenge to Amazon's anti-unionization stance, Edmonton, Alberta's Teamsters Local Union 362 filed for a vote on union representation at a company fulfillment center in nearby Nisku late on Monday.
Interviews with Teamsters units in other cities and provinces show that the union's efforts stretch from the Pacific coastal province of British Columbia to the Canadian economic heartland in southern Ontario.
The Teamsters' Edmonton unit says it has enough signed cards calling for a union to meet the 40% threshold to require a vote. Two of the union's units in Ontario and one in Alberta have confirmed they are signing membership cards with Amazon workers.
Two of the five units that confirmed to Reuters that they are organizing also said they are running campaigns at multiple sites, bringing the total Amazon facilities involved in some level of organizing to at least nine.
“Any locals that have an Amazon facility in their area are doing an organizing campaign,” Jim Killey, an organizer with Teamsters Local 879 near Hamilton, Ontario, told Reuters.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week Amazon Canada spokesperson Dave Bauer said in an emailed statement: ""As a company, we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees.""
Unions, he added, would prevent the company from changing quickly to meet employees' needs and represent ""the voices of a select few.""
The Teamsters say they can help workers win better wages and benefits, such as leaves of absence.
SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS
Unionization votes in Canada do not have any direct bearing on the United States, but they could raise enthusiasm, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.
“Organizing at a place like Amazon requires workers to take a certain amount of risk,” Logan said. “If they can look to other places and see that that risk has paid off for other workers, then they are far more inclined to do it themselves.”
Union members are going to great lengths to connect with Amazon workers, sleeping in their cars to catch the employees after graveyard shifts and forging ties at local churches. 
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has more than a million members in the United States and Canada, has made organizing Amazon a top priority, describing it as an “existential threat.""
Amazon does not have any unionized facilities in North America. The Teamsters is one of a handful of unions trying to undertake the daunting task of organizing the online retailer's vast, high-churn workforce.
Earlier this year, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) lost a vote to organize Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, by a more than two-to-one margin. Amazon pushed hard against unionization, and the result is being disputed.
The Teamsters have indicated they will not seek to hold such votes in the United States any time soon, arguing that the process is unfairly tilted toward employers.
But in Canada, where labor laws are more favorable, the Teamsters see an opportunity to go straight to the ballot box.
The organization is handing out leaflets at facilities across the country.
""You just want to see who bites,"" the Teamsters' Killey said. ""You throw your lines in the water and see which fish bites first.""
Killey said his chapter is campaigning at Amazon facilities in Milton, Cambridge and Kitchener, all traditionally working-class towns just west of Toronto, Canada’s most populous city.
""Where we see there is a lot of support, we're going to go full steam ahead,"" said Christopher Monette, spokesperson for Teamsters Canada.
Jason Sweet, president of Teamsters Local 419 in Ontario, said his unit has begun signing cards with workers in the greater Toronto area and has formed WhatsApp groups with Amazon workers to keep them abreast of the union’s efforts, delivering updates every 48 hours or so. ""We are trying to build relationships from the inside,"" he said.

In British Columbia, Teamsters Local 31 President Stan Hennessy said potential members have been very interested.
“It’s our hope that we can help these workers,” he said. “They certainly can use some help.”

860,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>",Analysis-Europe's power firms locked out of record price bonanza,"By Susanna Twidale, Isla Binnie and Stephen Jewkes
LONDON/MADRID/MILAN (Reuters) - Several European power firms have been shut out of bumper revenues from record high gas and electricity prices as their sales are largely locked in at lower prices, and face extra pressure from governments acting to protect consumers.
Power generators say government intervention could prevent longer-term investment needed to drive the bloc's energy transition plans, while smaller retail suppliers without the capital to hedge could go bust - limiting choice for consumers.
Benchmark European gas prices have soared some 250% this year due to a number of factors such as low stock levels, high demand in Asia and infrastructure outages, taking power prices to record highs across Britain and Europe.
In theory it should be a profitable time for generators with nuclear or renewable wind, solar and hydro generation, able to benefit from the high wholesale prices without also needing to pay the higher coal and gas input costs.
But with most generators having already hedged their forward sales they say there has been little opportunity to benefit, while government action in Spain has prompted an outcry.
""Electricity companies forward-sold 100% of their base production (hydro, nuclear and renewable) in 2021 and more than 75% of their 2022 production months ago, at much lower prices than the spot market,"" Spain's electricity providers association AELEC, formed of EDP, Endesa, Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) and Viesgo, said.
Endesa, a unit of Europe's biggest utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) blamed the impact of soaring gas prices for a 3% drop in earnings for the first half of the year.
Spooked by the impact on consumers, with many households still struggling with the economic impact of COVID-19, the Spanish government swooped to ensure generators don't make windfall profits, and claw back the perceived excess.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) forecast the impact on Iberdrola, Spain's largest power generator, which both generates electricity and has retail customers, at more than 450 million euros for 2021. 
An Iberdrola spokesperson said current national regulation had exacerbated the problem of rising international gas and electricity prices, at a critical time for multi-billion euro investment plans to meet emissions reduction targets. 
""The intervention in Spain will not solve these issues... This reaction will only create more problems for customers in the months and years ahead,"" the spokesperson said. 
Madrid's moves rocked power companies' shares. Enel is trading more than 6% down since Monday, while Iberdrola has seen more than 8% of its value wiped off the market this week. 
""ABSOLUTELY FLABBERGASTING"" 
The move has raised the spectre of possible interventions in other countries.
In Germany, energy prices are being debated in the run-up to the Sept. 26 election. 
Italy, where retail power prices are set to rise by 40%, is looking to review the way electricity bills are calculated in an effort to curb prices, two sources said.
Italian broker Equita said the estimated worse-case impact on Endesa core earnings of 1 billion euros is not the main worry, but rather the worsening regulatory environment and the fear of similar decisions in other countries.
""It is absolutely flabbergasting that countries randomly break into the market and confiscate revenues, making it impossible for companies to make the necessary modernisation improvements for those generation assets that are going to carry the security of the grid,"" said Kristian Ruby, Secretary General of Eurelectric, Europe's electricity industry federation.
In Britain the price impact has been keenly felt on some of the country's small energy suppliers, less able to hedge their requirements.
""The smaller suppliers tend to have less available operating capital, and less capacity to hedge forward, meaning any unhedged positions will be more challenging to meet with the recent spike in wholesale prices,"" said Dan Starman, Head of Assets and Infrastructure at Cornwall Insights.
Four smaller British power companies with more than 600,000 customers combined have ceased trading just this month and more could follow. [nL1N2QG1CT}
Ofgem earlier this week issued independent supplier Arvo Energy, which has round 40,000 customers, with an order requesting further details on its financing. Reuters was unable to contact Arvo Energy for comment.
Britain already has a cap on the amount suppliers can charge for their standard tariffs set by regulator Ofgem. This is set to rise to an average of 1,277 pounds ($1,762.90) a year but industry sources said on current prices the average would be more than 1,500 pounds a year.

Another price cap review will be announced next February with most analysts predicting another rise to come.

(Reuters) -A Royal Bank of Canada unit was censured and will pay more than $863,000 to resolve U.S. regulatory charges it broke rules meant to give retail and institutional investors priority in buying new municipal bonds.
In a civil settlement announced on Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said RBC Capital Markets LLC improperly allocated bonds to investors known as ""flippers"" who quickly resold their bonds to other broker-dealers at a profit.
Municipal bonds are typically issued by states, cities and school districts to fund operations and projects, and contain tax advantages over corporate and U.S. government bonds. 
The SEC said RBC knew or should have known that giving priority to flippers violated its rules on bond offerings it underwrote.
It said RBC also improperly bought new bonds it had not underwritten from flippers, rather than wait in line to buy those bonds from the underwriters.
The alleged violations occurred from 2014 to 2017.
RBC's payout includes a $150,000 civil fine, plus disgorgement and interest.
Two RBC officials, head of municipal syndication Jaime Durando and former head of municipal sales Kenneth Friedrich, were also censured by the SEC and fined a combined $55,000. Friedrich left the bank in 2016.
None of the defendants admitted or denied wrongdoing. RBC closed the flippers' accounts and improved surveillance to help avert a recurrence. 

RBC declined to comment. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The SEC has reached several settlements over flipping abuses in municipal bonds, including a $10 million accord with Switzerland's UBS AG in July 2020.

LUOYANG, China (Reuters) - A steady stream of anxious apartment buyers flowed into the sales office of the Evergrande Oasis complex outside the city of Luoyang this week, seeking answers after construction was halted by the giant developer's severe cash crunch.
Work on the five-tower condominium and 16 blocks of apartments at the sprawling development in central China has been halted since August and July, respectively, according to a staff member who declined to give his name.
The complex is among a host of uncompleted homes across the country that have seen work grind to a standstill as result of the crisis engulfing China Evergrande Group
Evergrande, the country's No. 2 property developer, is scrambling to raise funds to pay lenders, suppliers and investors, with regulators warning its $305 billion of liabilities could spark broader risks to the country's financial system if not stabilised.
""We worry that if Evergrande goes bankrupt, its assets could be frozen, and we'll lose the home,"" said Tan Liangliang, who is part of a social media group of about 200 worried buyers at the Evergrande Oasis project in Luoyang.
Numerous such groups have sprung up for the Oasis project, where the unfinished towers stand near rows of completed and occupied high-rise apartments.
At the 16 blocks, at various stages of completion, cranes lay idle and no workers could be seen. Plastic sheets flapped from some balconies, steel reinforcement bars protruded from others another.
Some buyers said they expected construction to resume this month or next, but others said sales agents had simply told them to wait. The staff member who declined to identify himself said construction would resume in late October or early November but gave no other details.
He said apartments there had been sold late last year for 9,800 yuan ($1,518.81) per square metre, or roughly $197,000 for a 130 square metre unit.
""I collapsed when I heard that construction had halted. How my heart hurts,"" a middle-aged woman who didn't want to give her name told Reuters outside the sales office. ""For regular folks like us, all our life-savings had gone into the house.""
Across China, Evergrande has hundreds of thousands of uncompleted units that need to be delivered to buyers, Raymond Cheng, a managing director of CGS-CIMB Securities, told Reuters last month.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cheng's figures, the Oasis complex or other halted projects.
Late last month, the company said some projects had been suspended because of delays in payment to suppliers and contractors, and that it was in negotiations with them and coordinating with the government to resume construction. 
Early this month, it held a pledge-signing ceremony with project teams across the country, promising buyers that construction would proceed.
""Two years ago when we were deciding which property to buy, we chose Evergrande because we thought it, being such a big brand, won't have cashflow problems like other property firms,"" another buyer said, declining to give her name.
Buyers are placing their hopes on the government, which has asked Evergrande to guarantee that it can deliver on units sold.

""This is a national issue, I don't think the government will let it blow up,"" another homeowner said.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 11:22AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Tougher EU airport slot rules trigger Asia retaliation threat, risk industry trade war","By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Regulators in Asian hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong have threatened to retaliate against European Union plans to force airlines to start using take-off and landing slots frozen during the coronavirus pandemic, a move that could oblige Europe's carriers to fly empty seats for thousands of miles at a loss.
Authorities controlling slots at major Asian airports are ready to slap similar 'use it or lose it' conditions on European carriers flying to Asia's cities - raising the prospect of an industry trade war over the uneven impact of COVID-19.
After rare unity during the pandemic, when carriers were being bailed out or trying to stay afloat, industry leaders say the dispute has rekindled fundamental differences across a fragmented sector as the world stages a multi-speed recovery. 
""Is it a trade war? Certainly the germ of one,"" said former Australian aviation negotiator Peter Harbison, chairman emeritus of the Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation consultancy.
""And it will be accentuated as more airlines collapse and international markets remain closed, or at best, uncertain.""
Tensions have grown since July, when the EU announced plans to force airlines to use 50% of their rights or lose them to rivals from next month. That move partially reinstated competition rules that had been waived as airlines struggled to survive the pandemic.
But while the EU decision reflects a traffic recovery that is well under way in Europe's mainly short-haul market, Asian carriers are protesting they will be unfairly penalised because their long-haul networks will take much longer to recover.
Some Asian regulators have already put European airlines on notice that they will need to fly at least 50% of the time, industry sources said, risking political fights over the future of transport links that are important for global trade.
'RECIPROCITY'
Singapore, one of several Asian jurisdictions to line up previously unreported 'reciprocity' rules, has included the provisions to ensure fair treatment, said Daniel Ng, director air transport at Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. 
In Asia, long quarantines remain the norm for travellers and airlines operated just 14% of their 2019 international capacity in July, well below the 46% of 2019 levels seen in Europe and 48% in North America, International Air Transport Association (IATA) data shows.
Cathay Pacific last month warned publicly that the slower recovery in Hong Kong meant it risked losing prized overseas airport slots and harming the city's hub status.
Taiwan's China Airlines and Korean Air Lines expressed concern about the EU rules in statements to Reuters, while Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) declined to comment. 
In Europe, Lufthansa - the EU carrier with the most flights to Asia - said the tough EU rules could ultimately harm the climate as well as airlines, if they are forced to fly empty planes to keep slots. Air France and KLM said their decisions to fly were not based on airport slots.
'SHOCK PHASE' OVER
The EU broke with a global industry recommendation and tightened rules for the winter schedule season, which runs from October to March, after heavy lobbying by low-cost carriers like Ryanair, with big short-haul networks, and European airports, many of which are privatised and trying to produce returns. 
""We're no longer in immediate shock phase,"" said Aidan Flanagan, safety and capacity manager at Airports Council International Europe. ""We are now in a situation where the market is stable with much lower levels than what we were in 2019, but it's stable.""
The European Commission said in July the 50% use rate - down from 80% in normal times - was chosen to ensure good use of airport capacity and to benefit consumers. It also granted exceptions so that airlines do not need to reach 50% while strict measures like quarantine that make it hard to travel remain in place.
The Commission did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
SIX WEEKS TO RESPOND
Once travel restrictions are lifted, Asian carriers will have to boost flying to the European Union within six weeks or risk losing slots even if demand is slow to return.
""When the demand is not there it is unreasonable to expect people to operate,"" IATA Head of Worldwide Airport Slots Lara Maughan said. ""It is a really short window they have once restrictions are removed to sort of recalibrate that whole operation back.""
René Maysokolua, managing director of German airport slot manager FLUKO, said his organisation had been informed that some Asian countries were telling European airlines they would need to fly 50% of the time or risk losing their slots in retaliation for the EU rules.
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea are among those taking a harder line against European carriers, said an industry source who was not authorised to comment publicly on the matter.
Authorities in Singapore and Hong Kong confirmed reciprocity provisions are in place but declined to comment on specific cases.

Korea Airport Schedules Office did not respond to a request for comment, but Korean Air, a member of the country's slot working group, confirmed the provisions.
Meanwhile, even as the potential for conflict brews between Asia and Europe, the United States on Thursday announced more lenient winter season rules for international carriers than the European Union.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China Evergrande's lenders weigh up loan losses, rolling over credit - sources","BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - One of China Evergrande Group's main lenders has made provisions for losses on a portion of its loans to the embattled property developer, while some creditors are planning to give it more time to repay, four bank executives told Reuters.
The Chinese banks' measures, reported for the first time, show how financial institutions in the world's second-largest economy are bracing for a possible collapse of Evergrande. 
The developer epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, with nearly $305 billion in liabilities across loans, bonds, so-called trust products and money owed to contractors and suppliers, among others.
Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) (AgBank), the country's No.3 lender by assets, has made some loan loss provisions for part of its exposure to Evergrande, one of the executives said, without giving details.
Meanwhile, China Minsheng Banking Corp and China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd, two other major Evergrande lenders, are prepared to roll over some of their near-term debt obligations, two separate sources with knowledge of each situation said.
AgBank, Minsheng, CITIC and Evergrande did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
In general, Chinese banks' exposure to Evergrande has fallen in the past year, and most of their outstanding loans are collateralized or guaranteed by deposits, according to the four sources. 
All the sources declined to be named as they are not allowed to discuss individual clients. 
Minsheng, for example, has cut its loan exposure to Evergrande to 30 billion yuan from 40 billion yuan over the past 12 months, one of the sources said, adding it also stopped offering new loans to Evergrande in recent months.
Last year, Evergrande reported total bank and other borrowings of 693.4 billion yuan ($107.4 billion) - including loans granted by trust firms rather than banks, which analysts said accounted for the bigger portion - down from 782.3 billion yuan in 2019.
Despite the retrenchment, an Evergrande collapse, even a managed one, would still reverberate through the Chinese economy given liabilities equal to 2% of the country's GDP.
The company's bank exposure is wide and a leaked 2020 document, written off as a fabrication by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed liabilities extending to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.
After that leaked document, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, requested all main Evergrande lenders to review their loan exposure and assess relevant financial risks on a monthly-basis, a source at a state-owned bank said. 
The PBOC and the sector regulator, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
ORDERLY COLLAPSE 
Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million of interest on Sept. 23 for its offshore March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million interest payment due on Sept. 29 for March 2024 notes. 
The bonds would default if Evergrande fails to pay the interest within 30 days.
Regulators have not given any indication to Chinese lenders of a possible bailout of Evergrande, said a source at one of the main trust creditors.
The editor-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Party-backed tabloid the Global Times on Friday warned Evergrande that it should not bet on a government bailout on the assumption it is ""too big to fail"".
Chinese regulators have in the past reined in domestic banks' unbridled lending to property companies, reiterated the need to curb property speculation, and emphasized the importance of deleveraging in the property sector.
It is possible the government may step in to manage an orderly collapse of Evergrande, said two banking sources familiar with the matter.

""And the regulators have done related risk evaluation among the financial institutions before letting it happen,"" one of them said.

(Reuters) -England's Manchester United and Italy's Juventus, Cristiano Ronaldo's current and former teams, both suffered hefty financial losses for 2020-21 as the coronavirus crisis drained European soccer stadiums of fans.
While Executive Vice Chairman Ed  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) expressed confidence in United's recovery as Old Trafford hosts capacity crowds for the first time in almost 18 months, Juventus said it would also end its 2021-22 financial year, which will still be heavily affected by the pandemic, with a ""significant loss"".
Woodward, who in April said he will step down at the end of the year, reflected on the difficult environment in which even the biggest clubs operate.
""While we are confident in our relative strength, it remains clear that football as a whole faces major financial challenges caused by years of material inflation in wages and transfer fees, exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic,"" he said on a conference call with analysts and investors.
United expects its wages to go up 20% this year after it bolstered the squad further by signing French World Cup winner Raphael Varane and England winger Jadon Sancho.
The Manchester club, which signed five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo from Italy's Juventus last month, posted a net loss for the year ended June 30 of 92.2 million pounds ($127 million), compared with a loss of 23.2 million pounds a year ago. The figure was inflated by a one-off tax hit.
Ronaldo, 36, made an immediate impact on his Premier League return with two goals against Newcastle United.
Meanwhile, Juventus saw its annual loss more than double to a record 209.9 million euros in a season when the team relinquished its grip on the Serie A title.
United, owned by the America-based Glazer family, and Juventus both attracted heavy criticism from fans and regulators for their involvement in the now-failed breakaway European Super League project earlier this year.

Shares in United, which did not provide full-year financial guidance due to COVID-19 uncertainty, reversed pre-market losses to trade up 1.5% on the New York Stock Exchange.

The company last month raised its annual dividend by 12.5% to $1.80 per share while declaring a second-quarter payout of 45 cents per share.
The company said the sale of its North Dakota assets should close in the next few weeks, with the outcome dependent on final government approval. The net proceeds from that sale, along with cash on hand, will be used to pay off the remaining $650 million in outstanding callable debt in the company’s capital structure, Diamondback Chief Executive Officer Travis Stice said in a note.
Diamondback had $344 million in cash and cash equivalents as on June 30 this year, more than thrice the $104 million it had at the end of December 2020. Current assets amounted to $1.14 billion at the end of June.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday, amid fears that the best of the Covid-era rallly is behind them.
The prospects of reduced monetary stimulus and the reality of fading fiscal stimulus - even though Covid-19 case rates are still high and having a visible effect on businesses and individuals - are combining with fears of a credit crunch in China to feed a general sense of unease. Technical indicators showing an ever bigger number of stocks flirting with bear market territory have also undermined belief in the broad strength of this year's move to new records, while a string of high inflation data is persuading many that the tightness seen in some product markets is due more to unsustainable demand rather than disrupted supply chains.
By 10:23 AM ET (1423 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 0.6%. The indices were all on course for their second straight weekly loss. That may reflect in part the urge to take profits as quarterly options and futures in indices and individual stocks expire later Friday.
Over 15% of S&P 500 stocks are now more than 20% off their peaks for this year, a statistic suggests that investors are losing faith in the ability of much of the market to keep growing earnings from their current levels. Warnings of higher input costs were rife in the recent earnings season, and the August consumer prices report, which painted a picture of pockets of inflation rather than a broad rise in prices, suggested that not all companies will succeed in passing on those higher costs.
Among individual movers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.1% and Alphabet  (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock fell 0.9% after the decision of both companies to pull an app on tactical voting in the Russian elections this weekend exposed both companies to fresh accusations of appeasing undemocratic regimes. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock fell 1.0% and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 2.6% ahead of a key meeting of the advisory panel at the Food and Drug Administration that will recommend whether or not people should get booster shots of Covid-19 vaccine. Recent studies, including those published by the companies, have indicated waning protection from their respective vaccines over time.. Official support for booster shots could result in a big step up for the drugs' total addressable markets.
Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) stock rose 3.6% after announcing a $2 billion buyback plan, in an expression of confidence that the company can increase shareholder returns despite the volatility in energy prices over the last 18 months. 
Elsewhere, China fears continued to prey on big mining stocks, with Vale ADRs (NYSE:VALE) falling 4.6% and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) ADRs (OTC:NGLOY) falling 6.7% after UBS downgraded its forecast for iron ore prices and the fallout from China Evergrande's debt problems threatened to raise financing costs for the rest of the Chinese real estate sector, which is typically the Chinese steel industry's biggest customer.

However, a recent U.S. court ruling that struck down AAPL’s requirement that developers use its in-app payment system is expected to reduce its revenues. Furthermore, with several antitrust allegations levelled at the company, will AAPL be able to deliver higher-than-industry returns in the near term? Read more to find out.Apple, Inc. (AAPL) is the biggest company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It is the fastest-growing U.S.-based company in history and is ranked #3 on the 2021 Fortune 500 list. However, the stock has dipped 0.6% in price over the past month and 3.9% over the past five days. This can be attributed to a recent court ruling that prevents the company from compelling its developers to use its in-app payment system, which deducts 30% commissions on sales.
AAPL’s revenues are expected to take a big hit because of the ruling, because developer commissions account for a large proportion of its Apple Pay segment earnings. The tech behemoth is expected to shrug off the losses soon through new product launches and service offerings, however.
AAPL launched its highly anticipated iPhone 13, Apple Watch Series 7, and iPad mini on September14. In addition, AAPL acquired classical music streaming service Primephonic on August 30, which is expected to improve its iTunes subscriber base in the near term.

Read on. Let’s find out.
Headquartered in Singapore, consumer internet company Sea Limited (SE) is well known for Free Fire, a popular mobile battle royale game developed by its digital entertainment platform, Garena. Even though its digital financial services platform SeaMoney is still in its early stages of development, its e-commerce platform Shopee has expanded in several markets. Its shares soared to hit their $359.84 all-time high on September 7, 2021, following the announcement of Shopee’s possible launch in Poland. The stock has gained 18.1% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $342.91. However, it is currently trading 4.7% below its all-time high.
On September 10, SE announced that it had raised approximately $6 billion in an equity and convertible bond sale, the proceeds from which it expects to use for strategic investments and potential acquisitions. However, move was not well received by all. Lightstream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri said, “The reason for this fundraising could be an early indication that the gaming business is no longer capable of funding the e-commerce and fintech growth.” 
In addition, the company continues to face intense competition from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other regional players, including MercadoLibre, Inc.

Investing.com – Canadian National stock (NYSE:CNI) rose 2.9% in early trade on Friday after the company took steps to assuage its shareholders two days after it withdrew its bid to acquire Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
The company said it will resume share repurchases and expand the program to as much as C$5 billion (around $4 billion) in 2022. It expects to complete the remaining C$1.1 billion of share repurchases from a previously announced exercise by January.
The transporter also aims to cut capital expenditure owing to what it called “current good condition of its network”. It is also targeting a lower operating ratio of 57% by 2022 and hopes to sustain it, an improvement of 460 basis points from the June quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Operating ratio is the amount spent to earn every dollar. The lower it is, the better.
The company is targeting a near-doubling of its adjusted earnings per share from last financial year’s C$5.31.  
Canadian National on Wednesday withdrew its $33.7 billion cash-and-stock offer that it had offered to counter  Canadian Pacific  's (NYSE:CP) $25 billion bid for Kansas City. The company blamed “significant changes to the U.S. regulatory landscape since CN launched its initial proposal” for its decision.

Outside the neighboring ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, the queue as of late Thursday had lengthened by 10 vessels over the past week and was expected rise even more in coming days, according to officials who monitor marine traffic in San Pedro Bay. The average wait was 8.7 days compared with 6.2 in mid-August, according to L.A. port data. The ship waiting the longest arrived on Aug. 23.
The flotilla, either anchored outside the ports or drifting further offshore until an anchorage spot is available, has a combined capacity to carry nearly 400,000 20-foot equivalent units of containers, according to data from the Marine Exchange of Southern California & Vessel Traffic Service Los Angeles and Long Beach. Both ports have handled a monthly average of about 862,000 inbound containers this year.
According to Hong Kong-based Freightos, an online shipping marketplace, China-to-U.S. transit times for ocean freight reached 71 days door-to-door this month, up from 40 days two years ago.
Bottlenecks are exacerbating capacity constraints in shipping and pushing transpacific freight rates to all-time highs.
Shipping a 40-foot container of goods from Shanghai to Los Angeles cost $12,424 this week, triple the spot price at the start of the year, according to the Drewry World Container Index released Thursday. Freightos, which measures container rates plus premiums and surcharges, shows a 40-foot box soaring past $20,000, compared with less than $4,000 in early 2021. 
The beneficiaries include AP Moeller - Maersk A/S (OTC:AMKAF), the world’s largest container carrier. On Thursday the Danish company raised its full-year profit forecast, signaling that consumer demand in Europe and the U.S. will remain at current levels at least through the rest of the year.

 State Street  (NYSE:STT) stock traded 0.5% higher. A deal isn’t imminent and the outcome could go either way, the WSJ said.
As of the end of June, State Street’s asset-management unit managed $3.9 trillion in assets. Invesco oversees $1.5 trillion in assets with a large ETF business.
State Steet has a market cap of around $32 billion while Invesco’s is a little over a third of that at $11.48 billion.
The march of mainly passive ETF-based investing has cramped the space for discretionary fund managers, pressuring them to consolidate to survive.

IHS Markit slashed its production forecast for this year by 6.2% -- or 5.02 million vehicles -- and lowered its projection for next year by 9.3%, or 8.45 million cars and trucks. The researcher also trimmed its 2023 estimate by 1.1%, or 1.05 million units.
“This is the largest single adjustment to the outlook in what has been a turbulent past nine months,” the research firm said Thursday.
The revisions reflect the challenge the auto industry has had coming to grips with one supply-chain disaster after another. First, the industry cut chip orders too deeply during last year’s initial pandemic lockdowns, ceding its spot in line to sectors that saw demand surge when consumers were forced into quarantine. Then came winter storms in Texas, a factory fire in Japan and Covid-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia.
The latest disruption originated in Malaysia, a hot spot for semiconductor packaging and testing. The government there has implemented rolling lockdown measures that may prevent the industry from returning to full capacity until late October, IHS said.
Analysts who regularly riff on IHS’s monthly revisions expressed shock on Friday. 
“The ’22 cut was the big surprise,” Credit Suisse’s Dan Levy wrote. “As far as we can tell it was IHS’s largest-ever cut for an annual forecast.”
Chris McNally of Evercore ISI called the cuts “huge” and said they suggest that consensus for suppliers’ earnings per share should drop by 15% to 20%.
“The complete and utter lack of current visibility means the group will likely now need Oct/Nov to find a bottom,” McNally wrote.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong on Friday proposed changing its rules to allow SPACs to list, but with tighter restrictions than elsewhere as it becomes the latest to tap the desire for such investment vehicles even as the frenzy that began last year wanes.
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong has been working on proposals for SPACs since early this year, but one challenge, market participants say https://www.reuters.com/world/china/asian-spac-listings-face-stern-test-regulators-consider-rule-changes-2021-03-30, has been finding a way of allowing such listings without undermining efforts by the exchange and regulator to combat illegal practices linked to the formation and trading of shell companies with which Hong Kong grappled in the last decade. 
On the other hand, there are also concerns that tough restrictions would mean the exchange would not be an attractive place to list a SPAC. 
The proposal is open for public consultation, with the deadline for responding set for Oct. 31. 
SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are shell corporations that list on stock exchanges and then merge with an existing company to take it public, typically offering strong valuations and shorter listing time frames than initial public offerings.
Under Hong Kong's proposals, only professional investors would be able to invest in a SPAC until it has merged with a target company, and the firms sponsoring a SPAC must include at least one institution licenced by the local securities regulator. 
The company that is acquired by a SPAC must also meet the same requirements as would a company listing in Hong Kong via an IPO, including being approved by the bourse's listing committee.
""We're confident that this will not go against what we're doing in terms of tightening (rules for) shells, and that enough shareholder protections and other safeguards have been introduced,"" Bonnie Chan, head of listing at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the stock exchange's parent, told the media. 
She added that a lot of companies had expressed interest in exploring a SPAC listing in Hong Kong, and that according to HKEX's count 25 U.S.-listed SPACs are headquartered in greater China, and approximately 12 companies in Asia have been acquired by a SPAC in recent years. 
Hong Kong is a major global IPO venue with companies having raised more than $35 billion there this year, according to Refinitiv data. 
SPACs surged in popularity in the United States late last year and early this year, and companies globally have raised $131 billion so far in 2021, according to Dealogic data, a lucrative development for U.S. bourses, where the vast majority of such listings have taken place. 
But the pace of capital raising has slowed in the second half of this year as investors have been spooked by many SPACs' poor financial performance and a regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over their disclosures. 
Hong Kong's rival Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY)  unveiled its final rules for SPACs to list earlier this month, after easing some measures viewed as too strict by participants following market consultations. 

Britain eased its rules for SPACs in July.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>",Ford wakes up badly burnt from its India dream,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co built its first factory in India in the mid-1990s, U.S. carmakers believed they were buying into a boom - the next China.
The economy had been liberalised in 1991, the government was welcoming investors, and the middle class was expected to fuel a consumption frenzy. Rising disposable income would help foreign carmakers to a market share of as much as 10%, forecasters said.
It never happened.
Last week, Ford took a $2 billion hit https://reut.rs/3nFLvnF to stop making cars in India, following compatriots General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) in closing factories in the country.
Among foreigners that remain, Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd and even Germany's Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) - the world's biggest automaker by sales - each hold less than 1% of a car market once forecast to be the third-largest by 2020, after China and the United States, with annual sales of 5 million.
Instead, sales have stagnated at about 3 million cars. The growth rate has slowed to 3.6% in the last decade versus 12% a decade earlier.
Ford's retreat marks the end of an Indian dream for U.S. carmakers. It also follows its exit from Brazil announced in January https://reut.rs/39fUnrq, reflecting an industry pivot from emerging markets to what is now widely seen as make-or-break investment in electric vehicles.
Analysts and executives said foreigners badly misjudged India's potential and underestimated the complexities of operating in a vast country that rewards domestic procurement. 
Many failed to adapt to a preference for small, cheap, fuel-efficient cars that could bump over uneven roads without needing expensive repairs. In India, 95% of cars are priced below $20,000.
Lower tax on small cars also made it harder for makers of larger cars for Western markets to compete with small-car specialists such as Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp - controlling shareholder of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India's biggest carmaker by sales.
Of foreign carmakers that invested alone in India over the past 25 years, analysts said only South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co stands out as a success, mainly due to its wide portfolio of small cars and a grasp of what Indian buyers want.
""Companies invested on the fallacy that India would have great potential and the purchasing power of buyers would go up, but the government failed to create that kind of environment and infrastructure,"" said Ravi Bhatia, president for India at JATO Dynamics, a provider of market data for the auto industry.
EARLY MISSTEP
Some of Ford's missteps can be traced to when it drove into India in the mid-1990s alongside Hyundai. Whereas Hyundai entered with the small, affordable ""Santro"", Ford offered the ""Escort"" saloon, first launched in Europe in the 1960s.
The Escort's price shocked Indians used to Maruti Suzuki's more affordable prices, said former Ford India executive Vinay Piparsania.
Ford's narrow product range also made it hard to capitalise on the appeal won by its best-selling EcoSport and Endeavour sport utility vehicles (SUVs), said analyst Ammar Master at LMC.
The carmaker said it had considered bringing more models to India but determined it could not do so profitably.
""The struggle for many global brands has always been meeting India's price point because they brought global products that were developed for mature markets at a high-cost structure,"" said Master.
A peculiarity of the Indian market came in mid-2000 with a lower tax rate for cars measuring less than 4 metres (13.12 ft) in length. That left Ford and rivals building India-specific sub-4 metre saloons for which sales ultimately disappointed.
""U.S. manufacturers with large truck DNAs struggled to create a good and profitable small vehicle. Nobody got the product quite right and losses piled up,"" said JATO's Bhatia.
RISE AND FALL
Ford had excess capacity at its first India plant when it invested $1 billion on a second in 2015. It had planned to make India an export base and raise its share of a market projected to hit 7 million cars a year by 2020 and 9 million by 2025.
But the sales never followed and overall market growth stalled. Ford now utilises only about 20% of its combined annual capacity of 440,000 cars.
To use its excess capacity, Ford planned to build compact cars in India for emerging markets but shelved plans https://reut.rs/3tMSnAs in 2016 amid a global consumer preference shift to SUVs.
It changed its cost structure https://reut.rs/3hFDY4c in 2018 and the following year started work on a joint venture https://reut.rs/3zoxBsk with local peer Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd designed to reduce costs. Three years later, in December, the partners abandoned the idea https://reut.rs/3tOcGxw.
After sinking $2.5 billion in India since entry and burning another $2 billion over the past decade alone, Ford decided not to invest more.

""To continue investing ... we needed to show a path for a reasonable return on investment,"" Ford India head Anurag Mehrotra told reporters last week. 
""Unfortunately, we are not able to do that.""

Money-market funds saw an outflow of about $62 billion in the week through Wednesday, the most since July 2020, BofA said in a note, citing EPFR Global data. Investors put $51 billion into stocks, the largest addition since March, and $16 billion into bonds. 
“Monster reallocation cash-to-stocks as tax redistribution threat recedes and Fed expected to remain Wall Street-friendly,” said BofA strategists led by Michael Hartnett. 
The Fed will probably hint at its meeting next week that it’s moving toward scaling back monthly asset purchases and make a formal announcement in November, but would hold interest rates near zero through 2022, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Investors have also been keeping track of President Joe Biden’s plans to raise taxes, as moderate Democrats have balked at recent efforts to target the assets of the wealthiest. 
The seven-month rally in stocks has stumbled in September over concerns about the rollback of monetary stimulus, inflation risks and China’s regulatory crackdown. But major fund managers remain invested and bullish on equities, citing a lack of investment alternatives. 
Equity inflows were led by U.S. stock funds with an addition of about $46 billion, according to BofA. U.S. large caps saw their biggest inflows on record and technology shares were investor favorites among sectors. Gold funds attracted $37 million, the largest amount in six weeks.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Friday, with investors ending the week on a cautious note ahead of key sentiment data and with an eye on next week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.
The main indices are marginally higher so far this week, but September has been a difficult month, as a rise in Covid-19 deaths, regulatory concerns in China, elevated valuations and the uncertainty surrounding the possibility of central banks cutting back their monetary stimulus all weighed.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.7% so far this month, the broad-based S&P 500 is off by 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has lost 0.5%.
Next week’s Federal Reserve meeting is limiting trading activity amid uncertainty over whether the central bank will announce a timeline for asset tapering, but Friday’s Quadruple Witching Day, when contracts on four different types of financial assets expire, could prompt more volatility.
The main data release is the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), which is seen improving to 72 from August’s 70.3. 
In corporate news, Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) will be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the investment management company is in talks to merge with  State Street  's (NYSE:STT) asset-management business.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) will also be in focus after a report that one of its pilots could face criminal charges for allegedly misleading regulators over the safety of the 737 MAX. 
Crude prices weakened Friday as supply slowly comes back online in the hurricane-hit U.S. Gulf of Mexico region, but losses are small as the recovery in output is still seen lagging demand.
As of Thursday, about 28% of Gulf crude production - over 510,000 barrels a day - remained offline, more than two weeks after Hurricane Ida hit.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $72.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $75.37. Both contracts are on course to post weekly gains of around 4%.
The CFTC’s speculative net positioning data and Baker Hughes’ oil rig count  are due later in the session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,761.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1774.

NAIROBI (Reuters) -Kenyan telecoms operator Safaricom,, said on Friday it had submitted a proposal to Kenya Power for the installation of a $300 million smart meter system at the utility, confirming documents seen by Reuters.
The telecoms company said it was now waiting for the utility's response, adding that it would install and operate the smart meter system for eight years if the deal is approved, before transferring it to Kenya Power. 
Kenya Power has said it had received the proposal from Safaricom and was reviewing it in line with internal processes.
The state-controlled utility, the main power distributor in the East African country, suffers from annual power system losses of 23.46% on its transmission network, well above the global benchmark of 15%.
The system proposed by Safaricom will use the Internet of Things, which allows real time monitoring of the grid, to cut the power system losses by eight percentage points in two years, the company said. 
""Technology has the potential to address many of our customers' business needs,"" Safaricom said. 
Safaricom proposes to split the additional revenue generated from lower system losses, projected at 71.7 billion Kenyan shillings ($651.23 million) over eight years, with 75% going to Safaricom and 25% to Kenya Power.
The telecoms operator will shoulder the cost of installing 330,000 consumer, transformer and feeder smart meters.
Kenya Power, which was once considered a blue chip on the Nairobi bourse, has slid into the red in recent years partly because of the power system losses, sending its shares close to their all time lows. The company also has a heavy debt burden. 

The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), an umbrella lobby of private firms, supports a debt restructuring programme for the utility, and a substantial reduction of its system losses to improve its commercial performance, it said in a statement on Friday, citing Kenya Power's strategic importance to the economy.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd said on Friday it will renew its listing application to push ahead with its plans to raise $1 billion in Hong Kong despite a 48% slide in its quarterly earnings.
The world's largest medical glove maker has been seeking a dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since last year, but the deal was put on hold after it was slapped with an import ban from U.S. authorities. It already has a primary listing in Malaysia and a secondary listing in Singapore.
The year-long ban was imposed on Top Glove for alleged forced labour abuses and was lifted last week https://www.reuters.com/business/malaysias-top-glove-says-cleared-resume-business-with-us-2021-09-10. It stalled the company's listing https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-gloves-1-bln-hong-kong-listing-delayed-amid-us-ban-imbroglio-sources-2021-06-01 plans and hurt sales, particularly to the United States, which normally accounts for 15% of the group's total sales.
The ban has hit Top Glove's reputation just as it was making record profits on increased demand for its gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last year,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) opted not to sponsor the deal on concerns of reputational risk. China International Capital Corp is currently the sole sponsor of the deal.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the ban removal was important and the deal would now be able to be marketed more broadly for a wider set of investors.
The source could not be identified as the information had not been made public.
Top Glove is aiming to raise $1 billion in the Hong Kong listing and will likely appoint more bankers in the future, the source said, adding it was set on completing the IPO as soon as possible.
Top Glove did not address questions about the listing during a briefing on the quarterly results, which showed a 48% drop in the company's fourth-quarter earnings.
""(The) results were softer on the back of normalising demand following (a) mass vaccine rollout, leading to lower sales volume and (prices), which were not matched by a corresponding reduction in raw material prices,"" the manufacturer said in a statement.
It recorded a net profit of 607.9 million ringgit ($145.88 million) during June-August, compared with 1.17 billion ringgit a year ago, lagging behind the 8.69 billion ringgit estimate by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.
Revenue slumped 32% to 2.11 billion ringgit, a stock exchange filing showed.

Sales to the United States fell to 4% of group sales in the quarter but were seen ""fully normalising"" after the ban lift, the company said.

Investing.com – ADRs and shares of the world's largest iron ore miners traded weaker Friday on fears of lower offtake by Chinese steel producers.
Worries over the debt problems of real estate developer China  Evergrande  (OTC:EGRNY) snowballing to hurt the real estate and banking sectors in the world’s second largest economy are also keeping the sentiment for the iron ore stocks subdued.
ADRs of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and BHP (NYSE:BHP) traded 2%-3% lower. Vale ADR (NYSE:VALE) was down 1.3% while  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) fell the most, by 4.6%, in London.  
China has for some years now resorted to annual steel production cuts at its factories to control emissions and reduce pollution. That exercise has met with limited success while causing great volatility in prices. The country is the world’s biggest consumer of metals as well as farm and non-farm commodities.
The country wants to keep its 2021 crude steel output around last year’s 1.05 billion tons. UBS expects that to be around 1.07 billion tons in 2021-22 and flat in 2022-23. This is around 5% lower than its previous forecast of 1.13 billion tons.
The bank expects the iron ore market to be in surplus this half, and sees iron ore prices averaging $89/t in 2022. Iron ore prices have already more than halved from this year's peak to around $106/t.
To make matters worse for iron ore producers, developments unfolding at Evergrande (HK:3333), China’s second-largest property developer, are also causing anxiety. Evergrande is set to default next weeek on some $300 billion in liabilities, and the poor performance of its own bonds is dragging down others in the sector, making it harder for other developers.to raise money.  "

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's AirAsia X Bhd (AAX) has made ""substantial progress"" in months-long talks with creditors as it aims to convene meetings with them to vote on a restructuring scheme by the end of October, its chief executive said.
Benyamin Ismail told Reuters in a telephone interview that negotiations with lessors, planemaker Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and service providers had progressed, but declined to share details.
The airline, an affiliate of AirAsia Group, also hopes to complete talks with potential investors for its recapitalisation by the end of the year.
""We plan to raise funding in December and get that completed as soon as possible,"" Benyamin said, declining to reveal details about the potential investors.
Benyamin said talks with creditors were in the final stages and all had indicated they want to see the airline proceed with its restructuring.
There were no objections to a proposal to move engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) Group into the same classification as most other creditors, he added.
The airline said in a stock exchange filing that ""final negotiations are still ongoing, particularly with respect to commercial arrangements going forward"".
In a court document filed on Monday, AAX said negotiations were still afoot but ""various letters of undertaking have been secured"" from creditors.
Many lessors have already struck other agreements with Southeast Asian airlines to take back planes early or reduce rates, at least temporarily, to help them survive the plunge in air travel caused by pandemic.
""Drafts of the lock up agreements and term sheets were sent to the lessors on (May 18). The lessors are presently in the process of reviewing them,"" AAX said.
The airline told the court it has received signed letters of undertaking from three large creditors to support and vote for the scheme, namely Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON), Bridgestone Aircraft Tire Company and Sky High I Leasing Company.
AAX proposed last October to restructure 64.15 billion ringgit ($15.43 billion) of debt, drawing objections from more than a dozen creditors, many of them lessors.
Airbus, the airline's biggest creditor, filed an affidavit in December https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airasia-x-lawsuit-airbus-exclusive-idUSKBN28W0JK saying it stands to lose more than $5 billion worth of orders if the scheme goes through. It declined to comment on the restructuring process.
This week, the court granted AAX an extension https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/court-grants-malaysias-airasia-x-extension-hold-creditors-meeting-by-march-2021-09-15 to hold its creditors meetings by March next year, when a restraining order https://www.reuters.com/article/airasia-x-restructuring-idCNL2N2O00AA preventing creditors from filing fresh lawsuits against the airline expires.
Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said AAX's low-cost, long-haul model was no longer sustainable due to the pandemic. 

""Creditors, including lessors and Airbus, understandably don't want to see the airline fall as they stand to lose a lot. The decision to work with AirAsia X to restructure is to salvage whatever they can,"" he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Biocon Ltd said late on Thursday its biologics unit will sell a 15% stake to a Serum Institute of India (SII) subsidiary for access to 100 million doses of vaccines annually for 15 years, including COVID-19 shots.
SII, which makes AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shot, branded as Covishield in India, is the world's largest vaccine maker.
The deal with Serum Institute Life Sciences values Biocon Biologics at about $4.9 billion and will solely focus on COVID-19 vaccines in the initial years, the companies said.
The 15% stake in the Biocon unit is valued at more than $730 million, Biocon's Executive Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said.
The unit, which makes pharmaceutical ingredients, will gain a foothold in the vaccine manufacturing space following the deal.
As part of the deal, the Biocon unit and the SII subsidiary will make and distribute vaccines and antibody treatments.
Biocon Biologics will also invest in setting up a research division for vaccines, with SII Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla getting a seat on the board of the Biocon unit.
SII also expects to ramp up its Covishield manufacturing capacity to 200 million doses per month, Poonawalla said at a media briefing on Friday.
While there is a current ban on COVID-19 vaccine exports in India, Poonawalla said SII was trying to strengthen its supply chain and source raw materials from within the country as well.
SII is also manufacturing and stockpiling  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, which is yet to be granted approval by the Indian health authorities.
In January, Abu Dhabi-based investment firm ADQ invested $75.47 million in Biocon Biologics for a 1.8% stake.

LONDON (Reuters) - British clothing retailer Next has struck a deal with Gap, to run the U.S. brand's business in the UK and Ireland, bolstering its market reach after showing its resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The deal gives Gap the opportunity to retain a significant presence in Britain and Ireland, having closed its shops in those markets earlier this year.
The two groups will form a joint venture to operate Gap's e-commerce business across the NEXT Total Platform, set-up Gap-branded Shop-in-Shops and offer click-and-collect options for online customers beginning in 2022.
Shares in Next were up 1.6% at 0842 GMT, extending their 2021 gains to 16.3%.
The partnership echoes moves by online retailers ASOS (LON:ASOS) and Boohoo to snap up fashion brands that have gone out of business in the UK and are no longer available on the high street.
ASOS bought the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands in February from the administrators of Philip Green's collapsed Arcadia group for 265 million pounds.
In January, Boohoo purchased the Debenhams brand out of administration for 55 million pounds and in February bought the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from the Arcadia administrators for 25.2 million pounds.
Next will own 51% of the JV, while Gap will own 49%.
Gap will be able to utilise Next's UK and Ireland store network of around 500 stores.
Next also has an online presence in over 70 countries selling its own brand and over 700 other fashion, home and beauty brands.

“Gap is partnering with Next ... to amplify our omnichannel business and meet our customers in (the) UK & Ireland where they are shopping now,"" said Mark Breitbard, CEO and President of Gap Global.
In July, Next lifted its profit forecast after pent-up demand for adult clothes and warm weather helped it smash sales forecasts.

Investing.com – Shares of Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) looked like extending their gains in Friday’s session as official recognition of its electric vehicles' capabilities encouraged investors to switch into the stock.
Lucid stock had risen 6.3% on Thursday after the Environmental Protection Agency certified that the range of the company's Air Dream Edition Range of cars outstrips any other in the EV space, including the more broadly held (and driven) Tesla. 
The stock traded 5.2% up in premarket trading.
Lucid’s 19-inch wheel secured a rating of 520 miles on one full charge from the EPA, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the body. That title so far belonged to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S Long Range Plus.
Taken as a whole, the Lucid Air models now occupy the top six positions for overall EPA range ratings among all EVs, the company claimed. 
So-called ""range anxiety"" remains one of the biggest factors putting consumers off electric vehicles, and Lucid's advances may help to calm such fears. However, Lucid still has work to do on the other big downer for electric car buyers - price. Lucid's Air Dream Edition with 19-inch wheels is likely to cost $169,000 at least. A cheaper base model is expected next year, according to reports.

At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
British policymakers are set to consider easing England's Covid-19 rules for international travel Friday, allowing those who are fully vaccinated more freedom.
The travel industry, hard hit by the pandemic, has been calling for such a move for some time, and airline stocks have responded positively. IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, stock rose 3.8%, Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock rose 1.6% and budget airline Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock climbed 1.8%.
Elsewhere,  Renault  (PA:RENA) stock rose 0.4% after the French auto giant announced late Thursday that it would cut up to 2,000 engineering and support jobs in France as it shifts into electric cars and hires in different positions.
Staying with corporate news, S4 Capital (LON:SFOR) stock rose 0.5% after Martin Sorrell’s advertising agency agreed to acquire tech services group Zemoga, while Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock rose 4.2% following a report that U.S. private equity firm Cerberus is considering raising its stake in the German lender.
Elsewhere, U.K. retail sales surprisingly fell 0.9% on the month in August, a far weaker result than the gain of 0.5% expected, with consumers spending less at food stores and more on hospitality, services and motor fuel as the economy reopened.
The August consumer price index for the Eurozone is due later in the session, with the number expected to rise to 3.0% on an annual basis, a sharp rise from July’s 2.2%, and a full percentage point above the central bank’s target.
Chinese data earlier this week suggested growth in the world's second-largest economy will slow in the second half of this year, and this is occurring while Beijing increases its regulatory supervision on a variety of different sectors, also potentially weighing on growth. 
The China slowdown angle was also visible in miners' share prices, with  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and BHP all falling in London after UBS cut its forecast for iron ore prices. Beijing earlier this week announced it will expand the list of cities included in its anti-pollution drive this winter, something likely to curb Chinese steel manufacturing further.
Adding to the concerns, the risk of markets turning disorderly in China grew as real estate giant China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) lurched closer to default, its stock falling 10% in the process.
Crude prices weakened Friday as supply slowly comes back online in the hurricane-hit U.S. Gulf of Mexico region, but losses are small as the recovery in output is still seen lagging demand.
As of Thursday, about 28% of Gulf crude production - over 510,000 barrels a day - remained offline, more than two weeks after Hurricane Ida hit.
By 3:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $72.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $75.36. Both contracts are on course to post weekly gains of around 4%.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,761.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1777.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 03:31AM ET</span>",Small Australian iron ore miner suspends operations after one shipment,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australian junior miner Venture Minerals has temporarily suspended operations at its controversial Riley iron ore mine in northwestern Tasmania after just a single shipment, the company said on Friday, hit by a plunge in prices.
The project's location in the wilderness of Australia's southernmost island drew the ire of green activists, who have held multiple protests there since March, as the Bob Brown Foundation calls for World Heritage listing of the area.
Its sole shipment of 45,632 tonnes was bound for China through off-take partner, Prosperity Steel United Singapore Pte Ltd.
The company is completing a full review of the mine in response to declining market conditions and shipping costs that were higher than expected, it told the Australian stock exchange in a filing.
While the company feels some pressures will prove fleeting, it said, ""Venture believes the best course of action is to temporarily suspend mining operations to preserve the reserve base."" 
It plans to retain employees until market conditions improve, it added, to ensure ""the company can recommence operations immediately"".
Shares of the company fell as much as 42% on the news, before recovering a little to end down 29% at 0.055 Australian cents. 
Australia is the world's biggest supplier of iron ore, with about half the global supply of the steel-making raw material dug out of the dusty red plains of the Pilbara region in its west, by the likes of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).
Iron ore prices were on a tear when Venture Minerals brought on the mine this year, eventually peaking above $220 a tonne in mid-May, boosted by Brazilian supply constraints and shipping snarls stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But prices have halved since, reflecting easing demand from steelmakers in China and stricter environmental controls ordered by Beijing.
On Friday, investment bank UBS said it expected iron ore to average $89 a tonne next year, and put a sell rating on Rio.
Venture Minerals said each shipment was bringing in less than it had estimated against benchmark 62% prices in a 2019 study, as the discount for its 57% iron ore has also widened to 30% from 10%. 
Congestion at Chinese ports and coronavirus constraints have pushed shipping rates to about $54 per tonne from the $18 expected in initial studies, it added. 
The project was expected to run for two years, shipping out 800,000 tonnes of ore annually, while creating more than 100 jobs and injecting about A$100 million into the state's economy, the miner had estimated.
Venture Minerals has launched a study to develop a tin mine at the neighbouring Mt Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) in the Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Range Regional Reserve, which conservationists call a valuable rainforest area.

The tax break, which had expired in August, will now be available till the end of the year, the ministry said in a statement.
Japanese brands such as Toyota, Daihatsu, Mitsubishi and Honda dominate Indonesia's domestic car market, Southeast Asia's biggest.
Indonesia's biggest listed car distributors are Astra International and Indomobil Sukses Internasional.
Sedans and two-wheel drive cars with engine capacity under 1,500 cc will now be exempt from luxury tax until the year-end.
The ministry did not provide an estimate of revenue loss from the tax break. 
The government introduced the tax break in March to incentivise car purchases, which had been hit by an economic slowdown due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 

It was initially due to expire in June, but was extended until end-August.
Auto production rose 49% in January-July on a yearly basis, not just for domestic market but also exports, the ministry said. Monthly domestic sales have also recovered, with more than 83,000 units sold in August, close to pre-pandemic levels.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Any merger of Japanese chipmaker Kioxia Holdings and U.S. rival  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) should ensure critical operations are split equally between the two countries, a senior member of Japan's ruling party told Reuters. 
The comments from Akira Amari, a former economy minister and influential lawmaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), underscore Japan's desperation https://www.reuters.com/technology/japan-sees-peril-us-chip-hub-counter-china-2021-08-17 to preserve the remnants of its semiconductor industry, an area where it once led the world but has since been eclipsed.
""We shouldn't allow everything to be taken away to the United States,"" Amari said in an interview on Thursday.
""If Kioxia ties up with a foreign company, in particular an American company, then at the very least it will be necessary to have equal bases of operations in both countries."" 
Asked if he specifically meant production facilities, Amari declined to comment, saying the issue is linked to Japan's strategy.
Kioxia, previously known as Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Memory Corp, and Western Digital are in advanced talks for a possible $20 billion stock merger amid intensifying global rivalries over semiconductors.
Amari said he thought the two companies joining hands was not a bad idea. A combined Kioxia-Western Digital would control a third of the NAND flash market, putting it on par with South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).
""It is important to have mass scale,"" said Amari, who leads the LDP's task force on semiconductors. ""A larger scale allows more power in research and development and a quicker grasp of changes in client needs.""
Amari's view is in line with Japan's trade ministry. Ministry sources have said it is ready to back https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-tokyo-ready-back-western-digital-kioxia-deal-if-key-tech-stays-japan-2021-09-03 Western Digital's bid to merge with Kioxia provided control of cutting-edge technology stays in Japan.
Kioxia, sold by Toshiba Corp in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion, shelved plans for an initial public offering last year after U.S-China trade tensions slammed Huawei, one of Kioxia's biggest clients. Kioxia has said it is still considering an IPO.

Toshiba, which retains about 40.6% of Kioxia, is separately in talks with at least four global private equity firms about its strategic options. That is also a potential issue of concern for Japan's government which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset because it makes defence equipment and nuclear reactors. 
Asked about the possibility that Toshiba could be taken private, an option that some shareholders are pressing the firm to consider, Amari said Toshiba's stakeholders should first think about how the firm's management structure should look.

Sorrell, the founder of WPP (LON:WPP), has turned S4 into a $6 billion company in the three years since it launched, by acquiring businesses to combine data with digital content and serve the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Burberry and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The move into tech services is designed to enable it to better compete with the likes of Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Globant, which can sell both digital advertising services to a client, as well as internal digital transformation advice. 
Sorrell said Zemoga would help S4 take a significant step towards building a third practice area around technology services. A digital transformation group, Zemoga provides product design, engineering and delivery services to clients including Bridgestone,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY),  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Morningstar.

The Financial Times reported Thursday that ECB chief economist Philip Lane revealed in a private meeting with German economists that the ECB only expects to hit its 2% inflation goal by 2025, a forecast that implies a long wait before the bank's first interest rate hike.
Chinese data earlier this week suggested growth in the world's second-largest economy will slow in the second half of this year, and this is occurring while Beijing increases its regulatory supervision on a variety of different sectors, also potentially weighing on growth.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2021 01:50AM ET</span>","China Evergrande is not 'too big to fail', says Global Times editor","HONG KONG (Reuters) -The editor-in-chief of state-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times warned debt-ridden property giant Evergrande Group that it should not bet on a government bailout on the assumption that it is ""too big to fail"".
It was the first commentary to appear in state-backed media casting doubt on a government bailout for the country's No.2 property developer, whose shares fell on Friday for the fifth consecutive day amid concerns it is heading for default.
Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers and investors, with regulators warning its $305 billion of liabilities could spark broader risks to the country's financial system if not stabilised.
Global Times' editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on his WeChat social media account on Thursday that Evergrande should turn to the market for salvation, not the government.
He said Evergrande's potential bankruptcy was unlikely to trigger a systemic financial storm like the collapse of Lehman Brothers, because it was a real estate business not a bank and downpayment ratios on property in China were very high. 
Global Times is a nationalistic tabloid published by the Communist Party's People's Daily. Its views do not necessarily reflect the official thinking of policymakers. 
Policymakers are telling Evergrande's major lenders to extend interest payments or rollover loans, and market watchers increasingly think a direct bailout from the government is unlikely.
A group of Evergrande's offshore bondholders has selected investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis as advisers on a potential restructuring of a tranche of bonds, focusing on around $20 billion in outstanding dollar bonds in the event of non-payment, sources told Reuters.
Evergrande is due to pay $83.5 million interest on Sept. 23 for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million interest payment due on Sept. 29 for the March 2024 notes. The bonds would default if Evergrande fails to pay the interest within 30 days. 
The debacle of Evergrande - which has more than 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities - is dampening the yuan and confidence in Chinese assets more broadly.

Evergrande shares fell another 13% to HK$2.28 on Friday, the lowest level since Oct 2011. Its offshore Oct 2023 bond fell 10% to 16.125 cents
China Minsheng Banking Corp, one of Evergrande's major lenders, dropped 4.6% to a record low of HK$2.80.

Qantas Chairman Richard Goyder said executives had faced a high workload with no annual bonuses for the last two years, and a continued wage freeze at a time when attrition was rising across the airline.
""Our executive cohorts are talented and in increasing demand across a range of industries, many of which, unlike aviation and tourism, are experiencing high rates of growth and activity, with financial rewards to match,"" he said in the airline's annual report.
In the case of CEO Alan Joyce and executive management, any incentive plan would take the place of the traditional annual bonus plan, Goyder said, adding that a decision was expected in the second half of the financial year. 
Joyce's total annual pay rose to A$1.97 million ($1.44 million) in the 12 months ended June 30, up 13% from a year earlier, when he had taken a period of zero base pay, but his pay remained 80% below pre-COVID levels. 
Joyce has said he expected to stay in his role until at least July 2023 to complete a three-year recovery plan designed to cut ongoing annual costs by A$1 billion.
In a separate note to staff seen by Reuters, Goyder said the company would look to reward all employees if the recovery plan is completed successfully by that date.
""Nothing is finalised but we look forward to sharing more detail in the first quarter of next year,"" he said.

Other companies in the travel sector, including Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd and Air New Zealand Ltd, have offered shares to all employees as part of retention efforts.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -The Singapore government on Friday unveiled a S$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) fund as part of a package to attract listings to the city-state's stock exchange, aiming to boost its exposure to the region's booming tech sector. 
The co-investment fund of the government and state investor Temasek will provide late-stage private finance and investment for initial public offerings (IPOs) on Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY).
While Singapore is considered one of Asia's leading financial and business hubs, its bourse has struggled to capture big regional IPOs and has seen a wave of delistings. 
Given its relatively small base of retail investors in a city of 5.7 million, some homegrown companies have headed overseas to take advantage of higher valuations and trading volumes.
""We have heard repeatedly that one area where Singapore can do better is in making our public equity market more conducive for innovative growth companies,"" Gan Kim Yong, minister for trade and industry, said on Friday during an event at SGX.
""As more of our start-ups mature into regional and global companies, having a vibrant home equity market becomes more pertinent,"" he said.
SGX earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/article/sgx-regulation-spacs/update-1-singapore-exchange-targets-spac-hopefuls-with-relaxed-rules-idUSL1N2Q40ON unveiled new rules allowing listings of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, marking the first Asian bourse to do so since the now-waning U.S. SPAC frenzy began last year.
""The timing is right for this,"" said Vinnie Lauria, a founding partner at Singapore-based Golden Gate Ventures, about the new funding. ""We continue to see a strong upward momentum in SPAC interest that should last for the next 12-18 months.""
The new fund will be managed by 65 Equity Partners, a new fully-owned Temasek investment platform.
Adding more firepower, the investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board, EDBI, will also establish an upto S$500 million 'Growth IPO Fund' to invest in later-stage companies, with a view towards an SGX listing.
Contrasting with its current early-stage investment, the new EDBI fund will invest mostly at around two or more fundings rounds away from a public listing.
""This interagency initiative further sets Singapore apart as a capital markets hub,"" said SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye, adding that SGX will also offer customised services for issuers.
Rounding out the incentive package, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's central bank and integrated financial regulator, said it will enhance the grants it provides to support SGX listings.
The regulator will also increase the co-funding of listing expenses for all companies and step up grants to hire equity research analysts to boost coverage of local-listed firms.

""We know that the initiatives we are launching today are no magic bullet,"" said Gan. ""But we believe they will blow new wind into the sails of our public equity market, and make SGX not just a viable but a compelling option for innovative growth companies seeking a public listing.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with investors weighing the impact of China’s latest regulatory tightening alongside the prospect of reduced U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.21% by 9:54 PM ET (1:54 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.23%. Concerns that the impact from China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt crisis will spread continue to grow, and regulatory tightening for sectors from technology to gambling continues to hurt U.S.-listed Chinese shares and casino operators with exposure to Macau.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.15%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.54% while South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.11%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.85%.
U.S. shares ended the previous session mostly lower after a volatile session ahead of the quarterly expiration of options and futures later in the day.
Meanwhile, data released on Thursday showed that U.S. core retail sales grew 1.8% month-on-month and retail sales grew 0.7% month-on-month in August. September's Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index was 30.7, while the Philly Fed Employment was at 26.3.
The data also showed that initial jobless claims increased to 332,000 over the past week.
The Michigan Consumer Expectations and Michigan Consumer Sentiment indexes for September will be released later in the day.
Global shares are set for a second weekly drop, as the COVID-19 Delta variant continues to impact economic recovery. Continuous inflationary pressure and the developments in China also applied pressure. The Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down next week, could be another source of volatility. It remains to be seen whether the decision will provide any clues to the Fed’s timeline to begin asset tapering and hike interest rates.
“Investors just should be prepared for the fact that returns are much more likely to be muted over the next five years than what we’ve really benefited and enjoyed over the last five,”  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Bank chief investment strategist Jim McDonald told Bloomberg.
That outlook incorporates the prospect of lower valuations over time for Chinese firms facing more government involvement, he added."

Many big corporations in America are jumping on to the crypto bandwagon even as concerns grow over the environmental impact since ""mining"" digital currencies consumes massive amounts of energy.
Analysts have also raised questions about the viability of day-to-day use of cryptocurrencies.

At a news conference, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga criticized states and cities for jumping the gun by vaccinating 12- to 17-year-olds without health issues that put them at risk of severe COVID-19, which he said was only supposed to start on Wednesday.
Queiroga said healthy adolescents who have already taken one shot should not take a second - effectively seeking to halt nationwide immunizations for teenagers.
In a statement, federal health regulator Anvisa said there was ""no evidence to support or demand changes"" to its approval for children from 12 to 17 to be vaccinated with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) shots.
Queiroga did not specify a reason for requesting a halt, but said there were 1,545 adverse events registered, with 93% of them in people who received COVID-19 shots other than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - the only one approved for minors in Brazil. He also said there had been one death registered, in the city of São Bernardo do Campo just outside the São Paulo state capital. 
Anvisa in its statement said it was looking into the death of a 16-year-old who got a first dose earlier this month.
""At present, there is no definite causal relationship between this case and the administration of the vaccine,"" it said. 
Sao Paulo state, the country's most populous, said it has already vaccinated nearly 2.5 million people under 18 years old. Governor Joao Doria said on social media that Sao Paulo would not stop vaccinating adolescents.
Queiroga said evidence about the efficacy of vaccines for healthy teenagers was not yet certain, although clinical trial data has shown them to be effective in preventing illness.

The United States, Israel and some European countries have rolled out vaccinations to children. On Monday, England decided that all 12- to 15-year-olds will be offered a shot after senior medical advisers said kids would benefit https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-top-medics-recommend-12-15-year-olds-get-covid-vaccine-2021-09-13 from reduced disruption to their education.
It remains to be seen if Queiroga's comments will carry much weight. According to Carlos Lula, the president of the association of state health secretaries, the majority of states do not plan to halt vaccinations for this age group.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global share markets edged lower globally on Thursday as concerns about investments in China and a mixed day on Wall Street outweighed positive economic data in the United States.
The three major indexes spent much of the day in negative territory as rising U.S. Treasury yields pressured market-leading tech stocks, and the rising dollar weighed on exporters.
International investors who have been piling into China in recent years are now bracing for one of its great falls as the troubles of over-indebted property giant China Evergrande come to a head. 
Dwindling resources set against 2 trillion yuan ($305 billion) of liabilities have wiped nearly 80% off the developer's stock and bond prices, and an $80 million bond coupon payment now looms next week. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped to its lowest level so far this year.
A report from the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in August, indicating America's economic recovery is strengthening on positive trends in consumer spending. 
The strong data sent safe-haven gold down nearly 3%. 
However, the U.S. labor market remains under pressure, with initial jobless claims rising by slightly more than expected last week.
""(Retail spending) categories that were strongest in August were in COVID-beneficiary categories,"" wrote Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""Now incorporating today's retail sales release, we lift our real (personal consumer expenditures) tracking to +1.9% and GDP to +5.0%.""
The MSCI world equity index was last down by 0.25% , off an all-time high on Sept. 7. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 0.83%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.07 points, or 0.18%, the S&P 500 lost 6.95 points, or 0.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.40 points, or 0.13%.
Markets remain focused on next week's Federal Reserve meeting for clues as to when the U.S. central bank will start to taper stimulus, especially after the flurry of U.S. economic data out this week. 
On Tuesday, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed inflation cooling and having possibly peaked, but inflation in Britain was the highest in years, according to data on Wednesday.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's center-left President Alberto Fernandez was battling a spreading cabinet rebellion on Thursday, which was sharpened by criticism from his powerful Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
The government has been shaken in the wake of a bruising primary election loss by a spate of resignations tendered by leftist ministers allied with the more militant ""Kirchnerist"" wing of the ruling party.
Fernandez has yet to officially accept or reject the resignations from the ministers amid speculation about the potential breakup of his coalition and told local newspaper Pagina 12 that his hand would not be forced.
The government was badly beaten on Sunday in an open primary election, seen as a reliable indicator before a mid-term congressional vote in November in which the Peronist ruling party could lose its grip on Congress.
Fernandez now faces a stark choice of doubling down on populist measures or taking a more moderate approach to attract middle-class voters who rallied behind the conservative opposition.
""The governing coalition must listen to the message of the polls and act responsibly,"" Fernandez wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), saying he would guarantee the unity of the party and that the government would continue to act in a way he ""deemed appropriate.""
In an acerbic letter published on Thursday night Fernandez de Kirchner, who served as president from 2007-2015, accused the president of pursuing ""mistaken"" fiscal policies that exacerbated Argentina's economic crisis already made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Fernandez de Kirchner wrote that she had met with president Fernandez to suggest a candidate to take over as cabinet chief as part of a government ""relaunch"", though denied reports she had sought the resignation of Economy Minister Martin Guzman.
She also criticized government inaction since the defeat.
""The day after such a political catastrophe if you listened to some officials, you would think that nothing had happened, they were feigning normality and, above all, screwing around in their armchairs.""
COUNTRY RISK 
President Fernandez was due to travel to Mexico for a leftist regional summit this week but has suspended his trip to put the finishing touches to fresh economic measures which will be announced in the coming days, a government spokesman said.
Argentina's political uncertainty has spooked investors and weighed down local markets and the peso currency.
The official peso edged down, held in check by strict currency controls, but the currency dropped further in popular alternative markets. The S&P Merval stock index dropped before recovering later in the day.
In downtown Buenos Aires, people had earlier took part in largely peaceful street protests both for and against the government.

Ramiro Marra, director of Bull Market Group in Buenos Aires, said the political infighting heightened ""political, economic and social uncertainty.""
""It increases country risk, makes dollars more expensive and scares away investment,"" he said.

Jinko executives told Wall Street analysts on a quarterly conference call on Wednesday that its margins and profits had suffered due to the detainments, but would not disclose how much product had been held back by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB).
""We did have some modules stopped by the U.S. CBP and to request additional documentations,"" Jinko Director Haiyun Cao said on the call, according to a transcript seen by Reuters on Thursday. ""At this stage, we are cautiously optimistic for the results.""
Jinko officials did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The company is among the world's largest panel manufacturers and has deployed more than 14 gigawatts of panels in the United States alone, enough to power about 2.6 million homes, according to its web site.
A CBP spokesperson on Thursday declined to comment on Jinko's shipments.
The United States in June banned imports of products that contain silicon metals sourced from China's Hoshine Silicon Industry Co, part of the Biden administration's effort to hold China accountable for human rights abuses. 
Metallurgical silicon is used to produce polysilicon, the solar industry's key raw material. About 45% of all polysilicon used in solar module production is produced in Xinjiang.
China denies allegations that its solar firms are benefiting from forced labor.
Earlier this week, the top U.S. solar trade group said the ban ""represents a significant, widespread downside risk"" to the industry's rosy forecast. CBP inquiries into detained equipment could cause substantial project delays, the Solar Energy Industries Association said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly down on Thursday, paring losses in late trading after unexpectedly strong retail sales data underscored the strength of the U.S. economic recovery. 
The three major indexes spent much of the day in negative territory as rising U.S. Treasury yields pressured market-leading tech stocks, and the rising dollar weighed on exporters.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), buoyed by solid online sales in the Commerce Department's report, helped push the Nasdaq into positive territory.
""Looking at today, clearly we had positive news from retail sales and it looks as if the massive slowdown in the economy is not materializing as a lot of people expected,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""It's a nice reminder that the economy is still taking two steps forward for each step back even amid the COVID concerns,"" Detrick added.
Economically sensitive transports and microchips were among the outperformers.
Data released before the opening bell showed an unexpected bump in retail sales as shoppers weathered Hurricane Ida and the COVID Delta variant, evidence of resilience in the consumer, who contributes about 70% to U.S. economic growth.
""Once again, it shows the U.S. consumer continues to spend and continues to help this economy grow,"" Detrick said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.07 points, or 0.18%, to 34,751.32; the S&P 500 lost 6.95 points, or 0.16%, at 4,473.75; and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.40 points, or 0.13%, at 15,181.92.
Eight of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended lower, with materials suffering the largest percentage drop.
The consumer discretionary spending sector posted the biggest gain, with Amazon.com doing the heavy lifting.
Apparel company Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) gained 1.6%. Online marketplace Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc and luxury accessory company Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc rose 3.1% and 1.9%, respectively.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co rose 1.4% after it announced plans to boost production of its F-150 electric pickup model.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 94 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Thursday it will extend a shutdown of a Michigan assembly plant to mid-October following a new recall of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles over battery issues after 12 reported fires.
The largest U.S. automaker said the extension of the production halt at its Orion Assembly plant will go through at least Oct. 15. GM also said it was cutting production at six other North American assembly plants because of the ongoing semiconductor chips shortage.
GM said it will not resume Bolt production or sales until it is satisfied that the recall remedy will address the fire risk issue. It said Thursday it had reports of 12 fires and three injuries.
GM shares were largely unchanged in late trading.
GM in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules, at a cost now estimated at $1.8 billion. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from battery supplier LG.
It is not clear how long it will take GM to obtain replacement battery modules for recalled vehicles and whether it will have diagnostic software that will allow it to certify some modules do not need replacing.
GM said the additional three-week production halt at its Bolt plant comes as it continues ""to work with our supplier to update manufacturing processes.""
Earlier this month GM was forced to halt production at most North American assembly plants temporarily because of the chips shortage.
The new production cuts include a Lansing, Michigan, plant that builds the Chevrolet Traverse and the Buick Enclave.
GM is also cutting production of SUVs like the Chevrolet Equinox, Blazer and GMC Terrain at plants in Mexico and Canada. It will also make further production cuts at Michigan and Kansas plants that make Chevrolet Camaro and Malibu cars.

Separately, Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV Thursday said it will extend production halts at its Belvidere, Illinois and Windsor, Ontario assembly plants by one week through Oct. 1 because of the chip shortage.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday it plans a Sept. 23 White House meeting with automakers and others ""to discuss the ongoing global chip shortage, the impact the Delta variant has had on global semiconductor supply chains and the industry’s progress toward improving transparency.""

Multiple factors were weighing on investor sentiment. First was September's history for being a weaker month for stock performance. In addition, the previous week's August payrolls miss seemed to linger on investors' minds due to concerns that the delta variant of COVID was slowing the rebound in the economy. The real estate sector led declines as long-term interest rates increased. Consumer staples and utility stocks performed the best. In terms of market cap, the small-cap Russell 2000 Index underperformed the market after two strong weeks of outperforming the larger benchmarks. Growth stocks also outperformed Value stocks. I’ll discuss this and more below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published September 15, 2021 from the POWR Value newsletter).
Five of the last seven trading days have been in the red. While I don't believe we are headed for a bear market, there's no question of bearish sentiment. Last week, we saw four straight days of losses. In addition to the August payrolls miss, investors were also concerned about political uncertainty. In previous weeks, it was monetary policy that was front and center.
Now, there is a concern over fiscal policy and the infrastructure bill. We learned last Wednesday that Senator Joe Manchin only backs $1 trillion of President Biden's $3.5 trillion proposed spending plan. It's my belief that the Street is counting on this package, and it doesn't go through; we could see heightened volatility.

United has taken a tough stance on employees who decline to get vaccinated and in early August became the first U.S. carrier to announce it would mandate vaccines for employees.
The company also said about 95% of its U.S.-based management was fully vaccinated.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told CNN the airline would not require vaccines for airline passengers on its own but would follow a government mandate if adopted.
Kirby said it ""feels like a more efficient approach"" for employers to mandate vaccines rather than create a ""huge infrastructure"" at airports to prove passengers have been vaccinated.
Last week, United said employees who receive religious exemptions https://reut.rs/3En1P2i from the company for COVID-19 vaccinations would be placed on temporary, unpaid personal leave from Oct. 2.
Chicago-based United said nearly 20,000 employees had uploaded records since the company announced https://reut.rs/3Eyql0K its mandatory vaccination policy.
The Biden administration said on Monday that most federal employees must be fully vaccinated https://reut.rs/3ChAyfT against COVID-19 no later than Nov. 22, pushing large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly. 
Some airline officials told Reuters they are waiting to see a Labor Department emergency temporary standard (ETS) detailing rules for large private-sector firms on vaccines or COVID-19 testing before deciding on employee rules.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told travel executives on Wednesday that the ETS order is expected in ""a matter of weeks. ... We have been told in October.""
Airlines are also waiting for guidance due by Sept. 24 from the Biden administration about whether they are covered under an executive order mandating vaccines for federal contractors.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said on Thursday it told employees it would offer roughly two days of pay to employees who are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and share their vaccination status by Nov. 15.
Southwest said that starting on Nov. 16, employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to be eligible for quarantine pay.

WASHINGTON/CANBERRA (Reuters) - China on Thursday denounced a new Indo-Pacific security alliance between the United States, Britain and Australia, saying such partnerships should not target third countries and warning of an intensified arms race in the region.
Under the arrangement, dubbed AUKUS, the United States and Britain will provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines.
France, which loses its own submarine deal with Australia, called the plans brutal and unpredictable.
The United States and its allies are looking for ways to push back against China's growing power and influence, particularly its military buildup, pressure on Taiwan and deployments in the contested South China Sea.
U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not mention China by name in the joint announcement and senior Biden administration officials, who briefed reporters ahead of time, said the partnership was not aimed at countering Beijing.
But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the three countries were ""severely damaging regional peace and stability, intensifying an arms race, and damaging international nuclear non-proliferation efforts"".
""China always believes that any regional mechanism should conform to the trend of peace and development of the times and help enhance mutual trust and cooperation... It should not target any third party or undermine its interests,"" he told a regular briefing in Beijing.
Johnson said the pact was not meant to be adversarial and said it would reduce the costs of Britain's next generation of nuclear submarines.
""Now that we have created AUKUS we expect to accelerate the development of other advanced defence systems including in cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and undersea capabilities,"" Johnson told parliament.
The partnership ends Australia's 2016 deal with French shipbuilder Naval Group to build it a new submarine fleet worth $40 billion to replace its more than two-decades-old Collins submarines, a spokesperson for Morrison told Reuters.
France accused Biden of stabbing it in the back and acting like his predecessor Donald Trump https://www.reuters.com/world/us-move-dislodge-france-australia-submarine-deal-is-incoherent-french-ministers-2021-09-15. 
""This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision reminds me a lot of what Mr Trump used to do,"" Le Drian told franceinfo radio. ""I am angry and bitter. This isn't done between allies."" 
The three leaders stressed Australia would not be fielding nuclear weapons but using nuclear propulsion systems for the vessels to guard against threats. 
""We all recognise the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term,"" Biden said. 
""We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region, and how it may evolve because the future of each of our nations and indeed the world depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead,"" he said.
Morrison said Australia would meet all its nuclear non-proliferation obligations.
'STRONG ROLE'
One U.S. official said the partnership was the result of months of engagements by military and political leaders during which Britain - which recently sent an aircraft carrier to Asia - had indicated it wanted to do more in the region.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern welcomed the focus on the Indo-Pacific but said Australia's nuclear-powered submarines would not be allowed in its territorial waters.
Singapore said it had long had relations with Australia, Britain and the United States and hoped their grouping would contribute to peace and stability. 
Japan said the three countries' strengthening of security and defence cooperation was important for peace and security.
A U.S. official briefing before the announcement said Biden had not mentioned the plans ""in any specific terms"" to Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a call last Thursday, but did ""underscore our determination to play a strong role in the Indo-Pacific"".
U.S. officials said nuclear propulsion would allow the Australian navy to operate more quietly, for longer periods, and provide deterrence across the Indo-Pacific.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the new partnership, on which the EU was not consulted, showed the need for a more assertive European foreign policy.
""We must survive on our own, as others do,"" Borrell said as he presented a new EU strategy for the Indo-Pacific region. ""I understand the extent to which the French government must be disappointed.""
Biden said the three governments would launch an 18-month consultation period ""to determine every element of this programme, from workforce, to training requirements, to production timelines"" and to ensure full compliance with non-proliferation commitments.
Among the U.S. firms that could benefit are General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) Industries Inc.
General Dynamics' Electric Boat business does much of the design work for U.S. submarines, but critical subsystems such as electronics and nuclear power plants are made by BWX Technologies (NYSE:BWXT) Inc 
U.S. officials did not give a time frame for when Australia would deploy a nuclear-powered submarine, or how many would be built.

A U.S. official said Washington had shared nuclear propulsion technology only once before - with Britain in 1958.
""This is frankly an exception to our policy in many respects... We view this as a one-off.""

(Reuters) - It turns out robots are taking over jobs fastest around the world in places where their human counterparts are aging the most rapidly.
That is the conclusion of a new study that looked at demographic and industry-level data in 60 countries and found a powerful link between aging workforces - defined as the ratio of workers aged 56 and older, compared with those aged 21 to 55 - and robot use, focusing in particular on industrial settings.
The research showed age alone accounted for 35% of the variation between countries in their adoption of robots, with those having older workers far more likely to adopt the machines.
“Aging is a huge part of the story” in robot adoption, said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducted the study with Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. 
The research fits a longstanding trend of countries such as South Korea and Germany - which both have very rapidly aging workforces - also being among the world’s fastest adopters of robots, based on the number of robots per human worker they deploy.
“The U.S. has a huge technological advantage in a bunch of areas - including software and (artificial intelligence),” said Acemoglu. “But in robots, it's Germany, Japan and recently South Korea, that are further ahead.” 
Of the world’s top 15 robotics companies, seven are based in Japan and seven in Germany, Acemoglu said.

The researchers found a similar pattern inside the U.S. economy - with metropolitan areas that have older workforces also seeing great adoption of robots after 1990.
The study examined 700 U.S. metros and used the number of robot ""integrators"" - firms that specialize in installing and maintaining industrial robots - as a proxy for local robotic activity. They found a 10 percentage-point increase in the aging of a local population led to a 6.45 percentage-point increase in the presence of these integrators.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday asked the chiefs of four major fossil fuel companies and two lobbying groups to testify next month on whether the industry led an effort to mislead the public and prevent action to fight climate change. 
House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and Ro Khanna, chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment, sent letters to the chief executives of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), BP (NYSE:BP) USA, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co, asking them to appear before a hearing on Oct. 28 and provide emails and documents. 
They also sent the requests, first reported by the New York Times, to the heads of two lobbying groups: the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Chamber of Commerce.
""I plan to get to the bottom of how fossil fuel companies have raked in trillions of dollars of profit at the expense of our planet and our health, all while spreading doubt and disinformation about the dangers of fossil fuels,"" Maloney said through a spokesperson.  
The letter cited a study in the peer-reviewed journal Climatic Change that said 91 think tanks and advocacy organizations that downplayed global warming were funded by Exxon and industry groups. 
The requests come months after a video surfaced in June, in which an Exxon lobbyist said https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exxon-lobbyist-duped-by-greenpeace-says-climate-policy-was-ploy-ceo-condemns-2021-06-30 the company's public support for a tax on carbon was a ruse because the plan to curb climate change would never gain enough political support to be adopted. The day the footage aired, Darren Woods, Exxon's chairman and chief executive, condemned the lobbyist's remarks. 
The requests also come as Democrats seek to pass climate measures in a massive budget reconciliation bill, some of which fossil fuel interests oppose because they could add costs to drilling and mining.

(Reuters) - Warburg Pincus LLC is seeking to raise $16 billion from investors for its latest flagship global private equity fund, its biggest ever, according to people familiar with the matter.
The New York-based firm is in the early stages of raising Warburg Pincus Global Growth 14, and prospective investors are already looking to make commitments to the fund, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A spokesperson for Warburg Pincus declined to comment.
The new fund is poised to surpass in size Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, a $15.1 billion private equity fund the firm launched in 2007 that had been its largest fund to date. Its Warburg Pincus Global Growth fund raised $15 billion in 2018 and had generated a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 24.5% as of the end of June, one of the sources said.
Prior funds, the $13.4 billion Warburg Pincus Private Equity XII and the $11.2 billion Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI, had an IRR of 21.7% and 13.5%, respectively, one of the sources said.
Warburg Pincus joins other major private equity firms that are raising or have recently completed flagship fundraising. 
In May, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc raised its biggest ever fund, collecting $18.5 billion for its flagship North America private equity fund https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kkr-fundraising-exclusive/exclusive-kkr-raises-18-5-billion-for-flagship-north-america-buyout-fund-sources-idUSKBN2CK20W.

And because the aftermarket auto parts industry is expected to continue growing amid dwindling new car sales, we think O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY),  LKQ  Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ), Autoliv (NYSE:ALV), and Dana (DAN) could be ideal bets now. Read on.The sales of new cars have declined as a function of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has hamstrung automobile production. However, the demand for used cars has increased significantly since last year, as people have taken steps to avoid public transportation due to fear of catching COVID-19 . This has caused used car prices to spike. According to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, used car prices are up 18.8% from this time last year.
This bodes well for the auto parts retailers because the growing used car market drives increased demand for aftermarket auto parts because sed cars need to be repaired and parts replaced to keep running. According to the 2021 Joint Channel Forecast Model from the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) and the Auto Care Association, U.S. light-duty automotive aftermarket sales are expected to increase more than 11% to $325 billion in 2021.
Given this backdrop, we think auto parts manufacturers O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY), LKQ Corporation (LKQ), Autoliv, Inc. (ALV), and Dana Incorporated (DAN) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio now.

Citing supply chain challenges, IHS said it was cutting its light vehicle production forecast by 6.2% for 2021 and 9.3% for 2022, to stand at 75.8 million units and 82.6 million units, respectively.
Packaging (NYSE:PKG) and testing operations within the semiconductor sector in Malaysia were impacted due to the government's lockdown measures in early June, IHS said, compounding difficulties in an already constrained supply chain. 
""Our interpretation of the situation in Malaysia, which is responsible for 13% of the global supply of semiconductors for the automotive industry, has become more pessimistic,"" IHS said. 
""The two-and-a-half-month backlog that has built up since June will take time to clear and is anticipated to extend well into 2022.""
Automakers from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
IHS said the semiconductor snafus have resulted in lost production of 1.44 million units in the first quarter and a further 2.6 million units in the second quarter.

Currently, losses in the quarter are running at 3.1 million units and rising, nearly double its previous forecast.
""The outlook for Q4 now reflects heightened risk as challenges to the supply chain – primarily semiconductors – remain entrenched.""

(Reuters) -Facebook has removed a network of accounts linked to an anti-COVID restrictions movement in Germany as it announced a new crackdown on coordinated campaigns of real users that cause harm on and off its platforms. 
Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s security teams were expanding the tactics used to take down influence operations using fake accounts to do more wholesale shutdowns of coordinated groups of real-user accounts causing harm, through mass reporting or brigading.
In a related change, Facebook has also been working for several months to use its tactics against ""coordinated social harm,"" its head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said in a call with reporters on Thursday. 
He said these campaigns typically involve tightly-organized networks of real users who systematically violate its policies to cause harm, including away from Facebook, but do not violate the company's rules on influence operations using fake accounts or against dangerous organizations.
The changes could have major significance for how the world's largest social media network handles organized political and social movements on its sites. In a recent report on influence operations, the company said a key trend it saw was the blurring between authentic public debate and manipulation by foreign and domestic campaigns. (https:// How platforms should enforce against offline activities, which is often described vaguely in their rules, is also an area of debate which has gained attention in connection with violent events such as the U.S. Capitol riot. Querdenken is a movement of protesters who have railed against coronavirus restrictions in Germany. Facebook said the network operated by individuals associated with Querdenken used authentic and duplicate accounts to post and amplify harmful health misinformation, hate speech and incite violence across multiple internet services. Facebook also said the movement had been linked to off-platform physical violence and COVID related social harms. The Querdenken movement did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Facebook, which has been under scrutiny over its handling of anti-vaccine and COVIDw-19 misinformation which has proliferated online during the pandemic, said it was not banning all Querdenken content from its platforms.  It said it had blocked its domains from being shared and had taken down fewer than 150 Facebook and Instagram accounts, Groups and Pages.

Investing.com -- Stocks were mixed on Thursday heading into the last minutes of trading after a curiously strong retail sales report for August set investors adrift. 
The Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales rose 0.7% last month from July. That confounded forecasts for a 0.8% decline. The retail sales control group – which has a larger influence on U.S. GDP – rose 2.5%. Expectations called for a 0.1% drop.
The energy sector also fell, giving back 1.4% despite a recent run-up. The threat to Gulf coast production appeared to ease with the departure of Hurricane Nicholas from the region.
Strong economic data put the wind behind the U.S. dollar and pressured commodity prices such as gold. 
The labor market remained under pressure, with initial jobless claims coming slightly higher than expected last week.
There is scant data or earnings to be released on Friday. Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. Consumer sentiment
The preliminary reading of the U.S. consumer sentiment for September, as reflected in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, is seen improving to 72 from August’s 70.3.
2. Retail stocks
Retailers suffered during the pandemic but have been trying to stage a reopening rebound. Strong retail sales -- especially of online retailers and back-to-school shopping -- could help lift shares of major stores. The SPDR® S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) rose 1.5% Thursday. Consumers thus didn’t hold back their spending when they were supposed to.
The resurgence in Covid cases did reflect at restaurants and bars where sales were flat though still nearly 32% higher than from the year-ago levels.
3. A new coffee guy on the block
 Dutch Bros  Inc (NYSE:BROS) jumped another 33% in its second day of trading on the NYSE. It listed this week with an issue price of $23 and traded around $49 late in the session on Thursday.
The coffee drinks retailer made a profit of $6.3 million on sales of $404.5 million for the 12 months ended June 30. Key rivals include Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Dunkin’ and Peet’s Coffee & Tea.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>",Analysis-How Wall Street's hottest dealmaking trend fizzled,"By Anirban Sen and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly made a lucrative offer last March that Sportradar Group AG founder and CEO Carsten Koerl could not pass up.
He proposed a merger with his special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Horizon Acquisition Corp II that would have valued Sportradar at $10 billion. That was 110 times the adjusted cash flow of the Swiss sports gambling data company in 2020 of 76.9 million euros ($90.4 million). Most of its peers were valued at less than half that multiple.
Yet Wall Street's mood was about to sour toward SPAC deals, then its hottest dealmaking trend. Sportradar instead went public this week through a traditional initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at just $8 billion.
This account of the deal deliberations is based on interviews with four people familiar with the matter and on a Reuters analysis of Sportradar's financials. Spokespeople for Sportradar, CPPIB and Horizon did not respond to requests for comment.
    Boehly's SPAC deal would have taken Sportradar public in New York without the need for a heavily regulated IPO, which restricts companies' ability to give lofty financial projections to stock market investors. 
    Koerl and Sportradar's other top investor, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), believed Boehly could deliver on Sportradar's frothy valuation expectations because investors were fascinated with SPACs at the time. Some 91 companies had gone public in the United States through SPACs in January, versus 27 companies for IPOs, according to Dealogic. 
    Investors invited to participate in a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction backing the deal balked at the price sought and its comparison to other successful SPAC deals such as that of sports-betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG).
While Sportradar boasted rapid revenue growth, it also made aggressive assumptions about some U.S. states legalizing gambling. The company trimmed its valuation expectations to $9 billion but still failed to attract many investors.
    Sportradar decided in June to abandon the SPAC deal and registered for an IPO in July. It debuted on Nasdaq this week.
    The SPAC market deteriorated rapidly over the summer, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen capital market professionals and a review of market data. Now, SPAC deals that get inked often do so by offering sweetened terms on their PIPE. SPAC managers also have accepted less-generous compensation. 
Other companies that abandoned SPAC deals for IPOs in recent weeks include digital ad platform Outbrain Inc and F45 Training Holdings Inc, a fitness chain backed by Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg, according to people familiar with the plans. Both companies did not respond to requests for comment.
RAISED TOO MUCH MONEY
Investors have been spooked by many SPACs' poor financial performance and a regulatory crackdown led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over their disclosures. Only 32 companies went public in the United States through SPACs in July, versus 57 IPOs.
In January, SPAC shares had rallied 28% on average on their first day of trading. But in July, SPAC shares rallied less than 1% on average on the day of the deal announcement, much less than the 30% rise on the first day of trading after an IPO, according to Dealogic.
Many SPAC investors are selling their shares in the open market or exercising their right to redeem them once a deal is announced. SPAC managers have had to put more of their own money into the deals, forfeit lucrative compensation or abandon the attempted mergers altogether.
""We as an industry raised too much money too quickly. The party is over for the moment. There aren't enough investors who understand SPACs and want to invest in them,"" said Douglas Ellenoff, a SPAC lawyer with Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP.

For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3lif0sN
POOR STOCK PERFORMANCE
    The stakes are high. Some 438 SPACs that have raised over $130 billion in total for mergers have yet to find deals, and will be forced to return that money to investors if they do not ink a merger within two years of their IPO. Even if they agree to a deal, there is no certainty they can execute on it.
""What you are seeing now is a market adjustment, and it is incredibly challenging,"" said Jocelyn Arel, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LLP. 
    The SPAC market bonanza allowed some companies to list that would have been snubbed by IPO investors. The companies were instead backed by hedge funds and private investors keen to place speculative bets. 
This bonanza has fizzled. Some 94 SPACs of the 131 that have announced mergers since October 2020 are trading below their $10 IPO price, according to data compiled by IPO expert Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida. This indicates low investor expectations that they will be successful or will be completed at all.
The average redemption ratio for deals completed in July-August stood at 50%, up from the 24% average for the 40 mergers completed in April-June, according to SPAC Research. 
""It is now common for a SPAC IPO that raised $200 million to have only $40 million left in trust after most shareholders redeemed before the merger was completed,"" Ritter said. 
When telecommunications services company Syniverse Technologies LLC agreed to merge last month with SPAC M3-Brigade Acquisition II Corp, it had to offer most of its $265 million PIPE in the form of convertible preferred stock that pays a 7.5% dividend, rather than common stock. 
The SPAC managers agreed to restrictions to selling their stock for up to a year, and made vesting of 30% of their shares contingent on them trading 25% above the deal price for 20 days in a month.

Syniverse declined to comment. M3-Brigade did not respond to a request for comment.
""We clearly hit an inflection point and it was probably only a matter of time before the market slowed,"" said Christopher Barlow, partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

Let’s discuss.According to ReportLinker, the global pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing market size is expected to grow at an 8.6% CAGR to $162.69 billion by 2026. However, because the stock market is expected to remain volatile in the near term on concerns over the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on the economic recovery, pharma stocks trading at high valuations could witness a pullback in the near term.
So, we think it could be wise to bet now on fundamentally sound stocks Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMRX), Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX), and  Kamada Ltd . (KMDA), which are currently trading below $10.

Bloomberg News was originally fined five million euros ($5.9 million) in December 2019 for publishing a hoax press release in November 2016 relating to construction group Vinci, which had filed a legal complaint to the AMF.
The AMF said at the time that Bloomberg should have known the information in the hoax press release was false. 
""Our journalists, among others, simply reported on what appeared to be newsworthy information and were the victims of a sophisticated hoax, the perpetrator of which has not yet been found,"" a Bloomberg spokesperson said after Thursday's ruling.
""We hoped that the court would recognize the issues of press freedom at stake. We are disappointed the court has not overturned the original decision and will consider our options on appeal"", they added.
Vinci shares fell as much as 18% on Nov. 22, 2016 after the hoax statement, which said that the French group would revise its 2015 and 2016 accounts and fire its chief financial officer.
The AMF had said it had taken action against Bloomberg because it had published the statement without verifying it.
Vinci's share price recovered after the company denied the Bloomberg report and said that the statement was a hoax.

The appeal court's ruling was not immediately available on its website or on the AMF's own site.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing Co named a former senior Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) executive as its head of government affairs as the company continues to deal with the fallout from two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
Ziad Ojakli, who also served as an aide to former U.S. President George W. Bush, will be Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s executive vice president of government operations effective Oct. 1, the company confirmed. Reuters reported the planned announcement earlier on Thursday.
Boeing in June announced its long-time government affairs chief Tim Keating was abruptly leaving without giving a reason.
Ojakli will lead Boeing's public policy efforts, serve as chief lobbyist and oversee Boeing Global Engagement, the company's global philanthropic organization.
""His broad experience serving in executive roles in government and the private sector will contribute to our engagement with our stakeholders as we continue our focus on safety, quality and transparency, and transforming our company for the future,"" Boeing Chief Execuive Dave Calhoun said in a statement.
Boeing still faces significant scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and U.S. lawmakers. In January, Boeing was charged by the Justice Department with 737 MAX fraud conspiracy and agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement and settlement worth more than $2.5 billion.
Earlier this month, a Delaware judge ruled Boeing's board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over the MAX crashes that led to the plane's 20-month grounding and cost Boeing some $20 billion.

In May, two key U.S. lawmakers sought records from Boeing and the FAA on production issues involving the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has halted deliveries of the 787 as it works to address manufacturing quality issues.
Ojakli served as the managing partner and senior vice president of Softbank from 2018-20, where he created its first global government affairs operation after spending 14 years at Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Wu Lei says his small construction company in central China has accepted commercial paper from property developer Evergrande as payment for two years but with that paper's value now in doubt, his firm is on the verge of collapse.
China Evergrande Group, saddled with more than $300 billion in total liabilities equivalent to 2% of China's GDP, is in the throes of a liquidity crisis that has it scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers.
Wu, 35, was one of around a hundred protesters who descended on the headquarters of the country's No. 2 real estate developer in Shenzhen this week desperately seeking assurances of payment.
""We were working for Evergrande, so our suppliers trusted us with the materials without us paying upfront. Now they're suing me, courts have frozen my property and I've sold my car. And I still have employees who need to be paid,"" he said.
The plight of Wu and many others like him has thrown a spotlight on the extensive use of commercial paper in China's property sector. Developers favour it as they prefer to not pay upfront and because it doesn't count as interest-bearing debt. The paper promises contractors and suppliers payment on a future fixed date, usually within one year.
Owed 500,000 yuan ($78,000) with another 2 million yuan due in March, Wu has now gone back to his hometown of Kaifeng in Henan province to pursue his claims in court but is worried it may take months to settle.
Evergrande says it is working hard to repay investors in its wealth management products and is in talks with banks to roll over loans, but has not mentioned smaller suppliers and contractors. Financial markets, meanwhile, have priced in likely defaults on its bond payments https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-applies-bond-trading-suspension-after-downgrade-2021-09-16 and expectations are high that its assets will have to be restructured.
It's not clear just how much commercial paper Evergrande as a group has issued, but its flagship unit Hengda Real Estate Group Co Ltd disclosed some $32 billion worth as of end-2020.
Despite its massive debt load, Evergrande's name had been held in high regard in ordinary business circles until late last year and its commercial paper was even traded in industries not related to construction.
An owner of a small marketing and consultancy business from one of the poorest counties in Guizhou province said he had accepted Evergrande commercial paper from a client and was waiting on 1.5 million yuan in payment that was now two months overdue.
""I feel depressed, and sorry for my family, having to accompany me in a life in debt,"" he said. He declined to give his name, citing rumours of physical threats being made against protesters.
While protesters numbered around a hundred on Monday, numbers had dwindled to two dozen by Thursday, with many losing hope or running out of money. 
One protester who gave only his surname Zhang left for Guangzhou on Wednesday after hearing of rumours the company would issue an announcement from there.
""But I think they might just be finding ways to split us up by dragging us all over the place,"" he said. 
At least two protesters were arrested on Thursday, but others were digging in, sharing links in protester chat groups for cheap yoga mats to serve as makeshift bedding while sleeping rough. 

""I'm reduced to sleeping on the streets and eating whatever I can get. I can’t afford to leave Shenzhen even if I wanted to,"" said one shop owner from Jiangsu province.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>",Boom for banks as M&A and pandemic boost corporate FX needs,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - A boom in corporate dealmaking, surging input costs and a focus on short-term cash flows in the pandemic have sent companies rushing to hedge their currency exposures this year, giving a boost to banks that sell foreign exchange products.
Corporate treasurers say the pandemic, which sent revenues tanking in 2020 before this year's sharp rebound, has encouraged many to hedge currency risks more frequently.
Relentless supply chain pressures, and a sharp rise in raw material and other input costs that are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars, are reasons for companies to lock in prices too.
And a surge in mergers and acquisitions as the recovery takes hold is also lifting corporate demand for foreign currencies. Global dealmaking is running at a record high this year, with $3.9 trillion of deals already transacted by early September, according to Refinitiv data.
Multinational firms are among those to have increased their foreign exchange (FX) market activity. 
A corporate treasurer at one FTSE 100 firm said its auditors had told the company to hedge its exposures more effectively and ""ensure that we only hedge the visible stream of revenues"".
This has resulted in more volumes and smaller deal sizes, a development seen widely - treasurers say the average hedging deal among other large British firms has shrunk to between $5 million and $10 million, from $20 million pre-pandemic.
""Corporate hedging activity has gone up in recent months because (companies') time horizons to hedge their FX exposure have shortened,"" said Naresh Aggarwal, policy director at the London-based Association of Corporate Treasurers.
REVENUE BOOST
It is proving a boon for banks' currency trading desks, offsetting a recent drop in revenues from investor clients. 
Activity by financial market players, including asset managers and hedge funds, surged last year as the pandemic uncertainty boosted FX volatility, but in this year's calmer market, they have cut back trading.
Instead, banks are benefiting from the jump in activity from firms scrambling to hedge, borrow more or expand overseas. JP Morgan, UBS and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are the top three banks by market share in the $6.6 trillion a day currency markets, according to a Euromoney survey.
Data on market-wide foreign exchange volumes has a lag, but the most recent figures point to a jump in corporate turnover.
Corporate activity on London's foreign exchange markets averaged $117 billion a day in April, up 16.1% from six months earlier, according to the latest Bank of England data.
The growth in ""non financial institutions"" volumes, a proxy for corporate activity, slightly outpaced market-wide growth of 15.6%, the data covering trading in the world's biggest foreign exchange centre showed. 
Deutsche Bank's global head of FX, Russell Lascala, said year-to-date FX revenues earned from the bank's corporate client base were up significantly on 2019 levels and helping offset reduced investor trading, though he declined to give numbers. 
Fierce competition for financial clients' business has squeezed bank profit margins. By contrast, corporations can provide stickier and more profitable business.
Lascala said Deutsche Bank was pricing unusual but more profitable trades for companies ""almost on a daily basis.""
""Corporates are doing more business, they need to hedge more, they are expanding, they are borrowing, and doing many cross-border deals. In previous crises it was very different, they were not as strong and were playing defence,"" he said.
The 12 biggest investment banks globally earned $28 billion in revenues from trading commodities, bonds and currencies in the first quarter of 2021, up 15% from a year earlier, according to Coalition Greenwich data. That was the biggest first quarter revenue for the banks in the past six years.
SMEs
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have also ramped up FX trading.
Laurent Descout, CEO of payments firm Neo, said turnover had picked up for his cross-border business after a slow start. 
The company had cleared $1 billion of transactions by the end of August, much of it within the last few months, Descout said, adding that firms were eschewing more complex currency option products for 'vanilla' tools such as forward contracts.

The supply chain disruptions, signs of rising inflation and uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery should keep corporate FX hedging volumes elevated.
Descout expects to see treasurers locking in FX rates for the ""next 12-24 months to support medium-term cash flow and protect margins"".

However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of its Delta variant, and the Fed’s dovish monetary policy stance, have been spurring renewed interest in tech stocks.
Investors’ interest in tech stocks is evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) 9.8% returns over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 5% gains. Furthermore, the ongoing digital transformation and increasing use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and other advanced technologies should keep driving the technology industry’s growth.

Taylor Dart explains why the metal needs to hold its support level.It’s been another rough week for the precious metals sector, with the price of silver (SLV) plunging more than 4% to undercut the $23.00/oz level, extending its year-to-date losses to nearly 14%. This has made silver one of the worst-performing asset classes of the year behind the Solar ETF (TAN) and Palladium (PALL), with silver now among the ten worst performing ETFs year-to-date. The silver lining is that the metal is oversold short-term, and sentiment is at its worst levels in years, but while this provides the conditions for a durable bottom, the key for the bulls will be defending the $22.00/oz level at all costs. A breakdown below this level would be a bearish development for silver and silver miners. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
Despite some of the highest inflation readings in a decade, the precious metals have been anything but a sanctuary, currently registering as the worst-performing asset classes of 2021. Not surprisingly, this has put a massive dent in bullish sentiment readings, with silver now one of the most hated asset classes on the planet from a sentiment standpoint. This is evidenced by silver’s long-term moving average for bullish sentiment dipping below 24% this week, the lowest reading for this indicator in nearly three years. The last time an asset class became this hated was crude oil (USO (NYSE:USO)) in April 2020, and while oil headed 5% lower, April ended up being a major bottom for the commodity. There’s obviously no guarantee that history repeats itself with silver, but when an asset becomes this detested, it’s wise to be open-minded for signs of a bottom. However, while sentiment will finally move onto a short-term buy signal on Friday, September 17th, the technical picture remains under pressure and is still just outside of a key oversold zone.

Given this environment, we think fundamentally weak EV manufacturing stocks Faraday Future (FFIE),The Lion Electric Company (LEV), and Lightning eMotors (ZEV) are best avoided now. Read on for an explanation.The governments of several countries have announced ambitious plans to phase out internal-combustion vehicles in favor of electric vehicles (EVs) to achieve carbon neutrality over the next few decades. For example, the Biden administration has allocated $7.50 billion for EV charging stations under a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. In addition, 29 Senate Democrats are currently seeking $160 billion in additional funding for EVs.
However, the EV industry faces several obstacles, such as production and supply chain bottlenecks due to an ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. Furthermore, given this industry’s increasing popularity, several start-ups have entered the sector absent an adequate product pipeline or technological capabilities. These stocks have been advancing in price based solely on industry tailwinds and aggressive marketing.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) -A billionaire e-commerce executive and three less-wealthy private citizens chosen to join him blasted off from Florida on Wednesday aboard a SpaceX rocket ship and soared into orbit, the first all-civilian crew ever to circle the Earth from space.
The quartet of amateur astronauts, led by the American founder and chief executive of financial services firm Shift4 Payments Inc, Jared Isaacman, lifted off just before sunset from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.
A SpaceX webcast of the launch showed Isaacman, 38, and his crewmates - Sian Proctor, 51, Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and Chris Sembroski, 42 - strapped into the pressurized cabin of their gleaming white SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, wearing their helmeted black-and-white flight suits.
Thumbs-up were on display as the capsule streaked into the dark sky, perched atop one of SpaceX's reusable two-stage Falcon 9 rockets. The Crew Dragon, fitted with a special observation dome in place of its usual docking hatch, reached orbit almost 10 minutes after the 8:03 p.m. EDT blastoff.
The rocket's first-stage booster, after separating from the spacecraft's top half, flew itself back to Earth and touched down safely on a landing platform floating in the Atlantic on a drone ship whimsically named Just Read the Instructions
Amid cheers heard in SpaceX's mission-control center as the spacecraft climbed to nearly 125 miles (200 km) above Earth, Isaacman read a statement thanking those who made possible a journey ""right to the doorstep of an exciting and unexplored frontier, where few have come before and many are about to follow.""
""The door is open now, and it's pretty incredible,"" he said.
Within three hours the capsule had reached its final cruising orbital altitude of just over 363 miles (585 km) - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the furthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972, according to SpaceX.
At that height the Crew Dragon was circling the globe once every 90 minutes at a speed of some 17,000 miles per hour (27,360 kph), or roughly 22 times the speed of sound. 
The flight, representing the first crewed mission to orbit with no professional astronauts, is expected to last about three days from launch to splashdown in the Atlantic, mission officials said. 
It also marked the debut flight of SpaceX owner Elon Musk's new orbital tourism business, and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to customers willing to pay a small fortune for the exhilaration - and bragging rights - of spaceflight.
NASA, which exercised a government-run U.S. monopoly over spaceflight for decades, has embraced the nascent commercialization of rocket travel. 
In a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) message posted shortly before Wednesday's launch, the space agency said: ""#Inspiration4 embodies our vision for a future in which private companies can transport cargo and people to low-Earth orbit. More opportunities to fly = more opportunities for science.""
Isaacman paid an undisclosed sum to fellow billionaire Musk to send himself and his three crewmates aloft. Time magazine has put the ticket price for all four seats at $200 million.
The mission, called Inspiration4, was conceived by Isaacman mainly to raise awareness and donations for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tennessee. 
SUBORBITAL SPACE BILLIONAIRES
SpaceX rivals Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and Blue Origin inaugurated their own private-astronaut services this summer, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 and Jeff Bezos https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-blueorigin-idAFKBN2EQ0EP, each going along for the ride.
Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's spaceflight profile.
SpaceX already ranks as the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. Two of its Dragon capsules are docked there already.
The Inspiration4 crew has no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which is operated by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, even though two crew members are licensed pilots.
Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate, has been designated as the ""pilot.""
Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Arceneaux, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physician assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Sembroski, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer.
The four crewmates have spent five months in rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams.
Inspiration4 officials have said the mission is more than a joyride.
While in orbit, the crew will perform a series of medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said.

Biomedical data and biological samples, including ultrasound scans, will also be collected from crew members before, during and after the flight.
Arceneaux was tasked with overseeing the medical experiments. She also made history as the youngest American launched into space and the youngest among just over 550 humans to reach Earth orbit, according to SpaceX.

Shares opened at $20, compared to their initial public offering price (IPO) of $19 per share. 
The debut comes after parent Genworth revived Enact's IPO earlier in the week. It had deferred the offering in May, citing excessive market volatility.
Genworth sold 13.3 million shares of Enact in the listing, raising about $253 million. Shares were priced at the bottom of the expected range of between $19 and $20 each. Proceeds from the sale of common stock will not go to Enact, and Genworth will continue to hold a majority position.
Investment management firm Bayview Asset Management also purchased 14.7 million shares of Enact's common stock in a private placement concurrent with the IPO. The stock had a value of $278.5 million, according to Reuters calculations based upon an Enact statement on Wednesday.
Genworth moved to list Enact after the parent firm's $2.7 billion buyout agreement with China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co, the investment firm of billionaire Lu Zhiqiang, fell through in April.
The deal, originally proposed in October 2016, stalled for years due to concerns over China's access to sensitive data on U.S. citizens.
Founded in 1981, Raleigh, North Carolina-based Enact provides credit protection to mortgage lenders and investors and operates in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
Enact grew its net insurance policies written in 2020 to $99.9 billion, compared to $62.4 billion a year earlier. Its profit fell about 45% in the same period due to higher loss reserves related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan were the lead bookrunners for the offering.

Investing.com –  Avis Budget  stock (NASDAQ:CAR) climbed 10% Thursday as analysts at BofA (NYSE:BAC) raised their target by 39% to $125 from $90 earlier.
The brokerage called the stock a buy, citing continued existence of factors that led to the company “over-earning” in 2021 next year as well. The target price is now around 25% more than the stock’s current level.
According to analyst John Murphy, limited incoming vehicle supply and tight average fleet, elevated revenue per day from the ongoing supply-demand imbalance, and moderated per unit fleet cost from elevated used vehicle pricing were all factors contributing to his optimism.
He believes the current stock price doesn’t fully capture the benefits that would arise as a result of the ongoing efforts at the company. This should result in upward revisions to 2022+ estimates that, he said.
Severe shortage of chips that has hampered vehicle output at almost every automaker in the world has forced consumers to turn to second-hand vehicle retailers, cab aggregators and rental car companies for their commute.
Avis’ June-quarter result was the best in its history as revenue more than tripled to $2.4 billion and adjusted earnings more than quadrupled from 2019-level to $624 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of China Evergrande Group bondholders has selected investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis as advisers on a potential restructuring of a tranche of bonds, two sources close to the matter said.
The advice focuses on around $20 billion in outstanding offshore bonds in the event of non-payment, one of the sources said.
Uncertainty about Evergrande's ability to meet funding obligations has sent jitters through markets, as one of the world's most indebted property developers teeters between a messy meltdown, a managed collapse or a more remote prospect of a bailout.
Evergrande has been hit by recent ratings downgrades, with both S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings warning of the risk of default, while a main Evergrande unit applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-applies-bond-trading-suspension-after-downgrade-2021-09-16 in a move indicating a rising likelihood of defaults and restructuring, market participants said.
Fitch Ratings has estimated that it faces bond interest payments of $129 million before the end of September and $850 million before the end of the year.
Nevertheless, hopes of securing a restructuring helped boost Evergrande's bonds, which hit close to 30 cents on the dollar on Thursday, with the March 2022 issue rising the most, up 2.5 cents, Refinitiv data showed. ""The bonds are rallying pretty hard,"" said one Evergrande holder. ""People are buying blocs, so seems like it's institutional (demand) rather than just retail.""

Evergrande Group, saddled with more than $300 billion in total liabilities - equivalent to 2% of China's GDP - is in the throes of a liquidity crisis that has sent it scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers.
Financial markets have priced in likely defaults on its bond payments and expectations are high that its assets will have to be restructured.

Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin on Thursday said MML Investors Services failed to detect the activities of Keith Gill, who touted GameStop stock in his spare time while he was working at the company.
Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, alleged MassMutual also inadequately supervised other agents and failed to review their social media usage or catch excessive trading in their personal accounts. 
The company agreed to pay a $4 million fine to resolve those allegations and another $750,000 for failing to register 478 broker-dealer agents. It also agreed to overhaul its social media policies.
MassMutual did not admit wrongdoing and said it was ""pleased to put this matter behind us.""
Galvin's inquiry into Gill remains pending. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Gill, known as ""Roaring Kitty"" on YouTube and ""DeepF***ingValue"" on Reddit, was a key figure in the so-called ""Reddit rally,"" which saw shares of GameStop surge 400% in a week before crashing back to pre-surge levels earlier this year.
He began sharing his positions on Reddit's popular Wallstreetbets trading forum in September 2019, posting a portfolio screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop.
By late January, Gill, 35, was up over 4,000% on stock and options investments in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his Reddit posts.
At the time, Gill worked at MassMutual in a marketing and financial education job and was a registered financial broker in Massachusetts.
State regulators found MassMutual failed to detect nearly 1,700 trades by Gill, who was able to execute at least two trades in GameStop in excess of $700,000, beyond a company limit.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Shares in Vitesco Technologies closed lower on Thursday after a volatile market debut, with the German car parts maker poised to fend for itself in the electric vehicle transition after spinning off from Continental.
For Continental's shareholders, who received one Vitesco share for every five Continental shares they owned, the combined value of their six shares at Thursday's close was 5.6% below the value of their five Continental shares on Wednesday.
The spin-off wiped 3.73 billion euros ($4.38 billion) off Continental's market value, which settled at just under 19 billion euros at market close.
Vitesco, which produces powertrains for international combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) cars and increasingly hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs), ended the day with a value of 2.36 billion euros.
Continental, among the world's largest auto suppliers producing everything from tyres to assisted driver systems, delayed the spin-off of Vitesco by two years due to unfavourable market conditions worsened by the coronavirus pandemic.
""We were confronted by developments that no one had foreseen,"" Vitesco CEO Andreas Wolf said at the Frankfurt stock exchange, adding ""the corona crisis fully confirmed our strategy ... e-mobility is booming.""
Vitesco shares started trading at 59.80 euros per share and swung between 56.89-66.88 euros in the course of the day. They closed at 58.9 euros.
The listing comes as automotive suppliers are struggling to reorient their production lines to stay relevant amid the EV transition, with EVs requiring not only fewer parts but new technologies such as batteries and software - not traditionally the expertise of Germany's auto industry.
Vitesco currently earns the vast majority of its revenue from parts for ICE cars, but Wolf told Reuters this month he hopes to break even on sales for EV components by 2024 and reap three quarters of revenues from EV parts by 2030.
In 2020, Vitesco's sales fell 12% to 8 billion euros as the pandemic combined with a global chip shortage and rising raw material costs stymied sales across the auto industry.
Still, sales in the first half of 2021 were up 29% on the previous year at 4.4 billion euros, with a profit margin of 1.9%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is developing a ""new system for international travel"" that will include contact tracing for when it eventually lifts travel restrictions that bar much of the world's population from entering the country, a senior White House official said on Wednesday.
White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients told the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board the administration does not plan to immediately relax any travel restrictions citing COVID-19 Delta variant cases in the United States and around the world.
Reuters first reported early in August that the White House was developing vaccine entry requirements that could cover nearly all foreign visitors. The White House previously confirmed it was considering mandating vaccines for foreign international visitors.
""The American people need to trust that the new system for international travel is safer even as we - I mean at that point - we'll be letting in more travelers,"" Zients said on Wednesday, adding it will eventually replace existing restrictions.
""We are exploring considering vaccination requirements for foreign nationals traveling to the United States,"" Zients said.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the same meeting that the spike in COVID-19 cases is preventing lifting international travel restrictions. ""We want to move to a metrics-based system,"" Raimondo said. ""Before we can do that, we have to get a better handle on the domestic situation, which requires us to get everyone vaccinated.""
Zients said the new plan would replace the current restrictions and would be ""safer, stronger and sustainable."" He did not lay out specific metrics for when the administration might relax restrictions.
""Vaccination rates matter here at home and other countries,"" Zients said, urging travel companies like airlines to quickly mandate employee vaccines. 
Some industry officials fear the Biden administration may not lift travel restrictions for months or potentially until 2022. 
The extraordinary U.S. travel restrictions were first imposed on China in January 2020 to address the spread of COVID-19. Numerous other countries have been added, most recently India, in May.
The administration wanted to lift travel restrictions ""as soon as we can,"" Zients said.
CONTACT TRACING
Zients said the new system will include collecting contact tracing data from passengers traveling into the United States to enable the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to contact travelers if exposed to COVID-19.
The Trump administration in 2020 blocked an effort to require airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers after some senior administration officials cited privacy concerns. 
Zients said they want the new system to be ""ready to press go on"" when it is safe to lift restrictions. ""We get the importance of this,"" Zients said.
The United States currently bars most non-U.S. citizens who within the last 14 days have been in the United Kingdom, the 26 Schengen countries in Europe without border controls, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil.
The United States separately bars non-essential travel by most non-U.S. citizens at U.S. land borders with Mexico and Canada.

Critics say restrictions no longer make sense because some countries with high rates of COVID-19 infections are not on the restricted list while some countries on the list have the pandemic under control.

(Reuters) - European stocks rose on Thursday as travel stocks snapped a four day losing streak after Ryanair lifted its long-term traffic forecast, offsetting concerns about China's slowing economy that dragged down miners.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 0.4%, bouncing off a six-week closing low hit in the previous session.
Travel & leisure stocks rose 3.4%. 
Europe's largest low cost carrier Ryanair jumped 7.9% after it raised its long-term traffic forecast. Rivals easyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Wizz Air gained between 3.9% and 7%.
""It's been a slightly better day for markets in Europe, shrugging off a weak Asia handoff, with some decent gains for travel and leisure, which has enjoyed a respite after Ryanair's announcement,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.
While Asian stocks came under pressure from concerns about China's economy and the fallout from debt-ridden developer China Evergrande Group's financial troubles, European stocks were on a firm footing as strong U.S. data reinforced optimism about a recovery in the world's largest economy.

And while the economy’s reopening this year has been shifting people’s recreational focus to outdoor activities, the increasing availability of cloud gaming should continue driving the industry’s growth. So, Gaming giants Electronic Arts (EA) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) should benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out. Electronic Arts Inc . (NASDAQ:EA) in Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, Calif., develops, markets, publishes and distributes games, content, and services for game consoles, PCs, mobile phones, and tablets worldwide. It develops and publishes games and services across various genres. In comparison,  Zynga Inc . (ZNGA), in San Francisco, provides social game services internationally. The company develops, markets, and operates social games as live services on mobile platforms, social networking platforms, and personal computer consoles.
The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be a blessing in disguise for the gaming industry, which saw a major surge in its consumer base because people spent most of their time at home during the worst of the public health crisis. Even though a semiconductor shortage and shift in consumer focus now toward outdoor activities could hurt the gaming industry in the near term, the increasing availability of online, mobile, and cloud gaming should deliver decent growth. Indeed, according to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global gaming market is expected to grow at a 13.2% CAGR between 2021 - 2028. Consequently, both EA and ZNGA should benefit.
EA has gained 4.7% in price over the past six months, while ZNGA generated negative returns. Also, EA’s 6.8% gains over the past year are higher than ZNGA’s negative returns.

Investing.com – Ford Motor stock (NYSE:F) rose 1% Thursday as the company said it will boost output and add jobs to meet demand for its all-electric truck F-150 Lightning.
The company said it has taken more than 150,000 reservations for the trucks to date. The vehicle will be one of the mainstays of Ford’s EV play.
Ford said it is investing an additional $250 million and adding 450 more direct jobs across its Rouge electric vehicle Center, Van Dyke electric powertrain center and Rawsonville components plant in Michigan.
The investment and added jobs will help increase production capacity to 80,000 trucks a year.
Workers at the Rawsonville components plant will assemble the batteries and the Van Dyke electric powertrain center will increase its capacity to supply electric motors and electric transaxles for the F-150 Lightning.
Ford has priced its F-150 Lightning aggressively. The base model costs $40,000, making it more affordable than the next cheapest truck, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Cybertruck. Rivals like the Rivian R1T and the Hummer EV cost a lot more.
The vehicle has a targeted EPA-estimated driving range of 300 miles with the extended-range battery.
The company has been making all efforts to get deeper into the EV market. It has a joint venture with South Korea’s SK Innovation to produce approximately 60 GWh annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade, with potential to expand.
Ford is also putting in more equity in Solid Power, a producer of all-solid-state batteries for EVs. Solid-state batteries are showing great promise. They don’t use the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion batteries, can be lighter, with greater energy density and provide more range and lower cost.

LONDON (Reuters) -Piers Morgan, the outspoken British journalist and broadcaster, has joined Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Fox News Media in a global deal that includes a new TV show in early 2022, newspaper columns and a book contract.
Murdoch said in a statement on Thursday Morgan was ""the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire"". 
""Piers is a brilliant presenter, a talented journalist and says what people are thinking and feeling,"" he said.
The 56-year-old's TV show will air on weeknights on FOX News Media's streaming service FOX Nation in the United States, Sky News Australia and on talkTV, a new British channel that will launch early next year.
TalkTV will debut less than a year after GB News launched in June, aimed at challenging what it cast as the London-centred consensus of the British media. It has since struggled to secure large audiences, and its chairman and lead presenter Andrew Neil announced his resignation on Monday.
Murdoch's new channel, which will be available on linear and internet television, will feature presenters from his radio stations talkRADIO, talkSPORT, Virgin Radio and Times Radio, and newspapers The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. 
Morgan, who previously edited Murdoch's defunct News of the World tabloid and hosted a show on CNN, resigned from British broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV)'s breakfast show after he said in March he did not believe Prince Harry's wife, Meghan, when she told Oprah Winfrey in an interview that she had endured racist and unkind comments from members of the royal household.
More than 50,000 people complained about his comments, but Britain's media regulator ruled that ITV did not break the broadcasting code on the grounds that Morgan was challenged by other presenters.
Morgan said he was thrilled to be returning to News Corp, where he began his media career more than 30 years ago. He left to edit a rival tabloid, the Daily Mirror, a job he held for nine years until 2004 when he was sacked for publishing false images of British soldiers abusing prisoners in Iraq.
As well as his TV show, Morgan will write columns in The Sun and the New York Post, the company said, and HarperCollins UK will publish his next book.

""Rupert Murdoch has been a constant and fearless champion of free speech and we are going to be building something new and very exciting together,"" he said. 
""I'm going home and we're going to have some fun.""

The finance ministry said in a statement that the settlement will conclude a lawsuit filed against the auditor in July, and that KPMG will expedite the payment.
KPMG confirmed to Reuters in an email that a settlement has been reached in the claim filed against a number of current and former partners at the audit firm in Malaysia.
""This settlement represents a collective agreement by all the parties, including the Malaysian government,"" it said.
The outcome, it said, will enable all involved to ""move forward"", and for the firm to focus on building public trust.
The finance ministry said the settlement was valued at more than 800 times the audit fees earned by KPMG, which ""represents one of the largest 1MDB-related settlements by an audit firm in Southeast Asia."" 
The government, 1MDB and its subsidiaries filed a $5.6 billion lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/kpmg-denies-alleged-breaches-negligence-after-reported-1mdb-lawsuit-2021-07-09 against 44 current and former partners at the audit firm on July 6, allegations that KPMG denied and pledged to ""vigorously"" contest.

(Reuters) - U.S. mining companies are blasting proposals in Congress that would set royalties for copper, lithium and other minerals extracted from federal land, with executives saying the measures would hurt domestic production of the building blocks for solar panels, electric vehicles and other green technologies.
The House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee added language to the proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending measure last week that would set an 8% gross royalty on existing mines and 4% on new ones. There would also be a 7 cent fee for every ton of rock moved. 
That would mark one of the most-substantial changes to the law that has governed U.S. mining since 1872 and could raise about $2 billion over 10 years for federal coffers.
The full House could reverse the committee's move and the legislation faces an uncertain fate in the U.S. Senate.
""The race for electric vehicles and electrification of the economy requires metals and mining, and that needs to be incentivized, not stalled,"" said Rich Nolan, head of the National Mining Association, an industry trade group.
Tensions are rising in the United States over how best to procure minerals needed to green the economy. President Joe Biden has yet to take a public stance on the issue, though privately he has signaled plans to rely on allies for EV metals, Reuters reported earlier this year.
The 1872 law did not set royalties in order to encourage development of more than 350 million acres in the western United States. Miners say it should remain as-is, or be tweaked only slightly. Environmentalists have long said the law should be updated to require the industry to pay to extract minerals on taxpayer-owned land. 
Executives say Biden's goal to have 35% of U.S. electricity generated by solar panels - up from 3% today - would be all but impossible without new mines. Silver is used to make photovoltaic cells.
""This royalty proposal is really inconsistent with being able to grow production and meeting the demands for silver to green the economy,"" said Phil Baker, chief executive of Hecla Mining Co, the largest U.S. silver producer. Baker said he will close mines if the proposal is approved.
Miners say they already pay high income, sales and other taxes. They warned that the proposed royalty on gross profit would discourage investment when commodity prices rise and shorten a mine's life when prices fall.
The NMA declined to say what percentage royalty its members would find palatable. It said it would prefer a royalty on net, rather than gross, profit.
""New taxes on the front end of the supply chain undermine the EV battery goals that have been set by the president and Congress and make U.S. policy look schizophrenic,"" said Todd Malan of Talon Metals Corp, which is developing the Tamareck nickel deposit in Minnesota. Nickel is used to make EV battery cathodes.
The proposed new royalty rates would affect so-called hard rock mining, but are part of a series of other proposed fee hikes on oil, coal and natural gas extraction. The committee also approved language that would block Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd from building its Resolution copper mine in Arizona.
The NMA said it does support the committee's proposal to create a $3 billion reclamation fund for older abandoned mines.

Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, which is developing the Thacker Pass lithium mine on federal land in Nevada, said it stands ready to work with Congress to develop a ""reasonable royalty for operating on public lands."" Lithium is a key component of EV batteries.
""The current proposal will impair U.S. competitiveness when demand for lithium is soaring and the domestic production is just starting to respond,"" said Tim Crowley of Lithium Americas.

Investing.com – The S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) rose 1.3% Thursday after data for August showed a surprise gain in retail sales despite a surge in Covid-19 cases.
Sales rose 0.7% for the month when an Investing.com poll estimated they would fall 0.8% due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. Consumers thus didn’t hold back their spending when they were supposed to.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday threatened U.S. social media firms with sizeable fines if they fail to delete content Moscow deems illegal and demanded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google stop allegedly meddling in its internal affairs on the eve of parliamentary elections.
Internet services are coming under increasing pressure ahead of Russia's Sept. 17-19 parliamentary vote. Russia's authorities have said foreign firms are hampering their efforts to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and online resources linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Now, a long-running dispute over banned content looks set to move up a gear after Vadim Subbotin, deputy head of state communications regulator Roskomnadzor, signalled sizeable fines were possible. 
""We will now consider applying turnover fines on those companies that systematically violate Roskomnadzor's demands,"" Interfax news agency cited Subbotin as saying. 
While Russia has already levied several small fines on foreign tech companies, imposing penalties based on their turnover suggests potentially much bigger sums.
Subbotin named Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google as some of the firms at risk. 
Roskomnadzor now has ""substantial"" tools capable of enforcing the requirements of Russian law, he said, without giving further details. 
Roskomnadzor has successfully slowed the speed of Twitter since March, impeded some VPN providers from operating, and last week blocked major domain name system (DNS) services for several hours.
""Now, Russia is way ahead of China in terms of blocking capabilities,"" IT expert Mikhail Klimarev told Reuters. 
Earlier on Thursday, lawmaker Andrei Klimov said Russian prosecutors had made official approaches to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Sept. 9, telling them to stop breaking Russian law by continuing to allow people to access Navalny's banned tactical voting app on their companies' stores. 
""(Apple and Google's) actions during Russian elections are seen as illegal and directly linked to interference in Russia's purely domestic affairs,"" Interfax cited Klimov as saying. 

Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Apple's AppStore suffered an outage earlier this week and GlobalCheck, a group that monitors websites' accessibility in Russia, late on Wednesday said telecoms operators had started blocking access to Google Docs.

Also, the Biden administration's $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure framework, which the Senate passed recently, bodes well for the industrial metals sector.
Since steel is widely used in construction and manufacturing, Biden’s proposed spending could be a transformational investment that will afford steel producers great growth opportunities. Furthermore, because China has vowed to limit steel output this year to curb industrial pollution, steel prices are soaring.
And because this spike in steel prices is likely to continue in the near term, we think iron ore stocks BHP Group (BHP) and Vale S.A (VALE) could be ideal bets to cash in on the uptrend.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - New data from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's large COVID-19 vaccine trial shows that the protection it offers wanes over time, supporting the case for booster doses, the company said in a news release on Wednesday.
""This is only one estimate, but we do believe this means as you look toward the fall and winter, at minimum we expect the estimated impact of waning immunity would be 600,000 additional cases of COVID-19,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said on a conference call with investors.
Hoge did not project how many of the cases would be severe, but said some would require hospitalization.
The data stands in stark contrast with data from several recent studies that suggested Moderna's vaccine protection lasts longer than a similar shot from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
Experts said the difference is likely due to Moderna's higher dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the slightly longer interval between the first and second shots.
Both vaccines proved to be exceedingly effective at preventing illness in their large Phase III studies.
Wednesday's analysis, however, showed higher rates of infection among people vaccinated roughly 13 months ago compared with those vaccinated roughly eight months ago. The study period was from July-August, when Delta was the predominant strain. It has yet to undergo peer review.
Moderna on Sept. 1 submitted its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking authorization for a booster shot. 
Hoge said data from its booster studies shows the vaccine could increase neutralizing antibodies to levels even higher than were seen after the second dose.
""We believe this will reduce COVID-19 cases,"" he said. ""We also believe that a third dose of mRNA-1273 has a chance of significantly extending immunity throughout much of next year as we attempt to end the pandemic.""
Briefing documents from the FDA's analysis of Pfizer's booster application, released earlier on Wednesday, suggest that a key issue the agency will consider is whether vaccine protection is waning https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-says-third-covid-19-shot-warranted-fda-document-2021-09-15. 
In its analysis, Moderna compared the vaccine's performance in more than 14,000 volunteers vaccinated between July and October of 2020 with some 11,000 volunteers originally in the placebo group who were offered the shot between December 2020 and March 2021 following its U.S. emergency use authorization.
In the two-month period from July-August, researchers identified 88 COVID-19 cases among those who got the two shots more recently, compared with 162 cases among those vaccinated last year. Overall, only 19 cases were considered severe, a key benchmark in assessing waning protection.
Moderna said there was a trend toward a lower rate of severe cases among the more recently vaccinated, although the finding was not statistically significant.
Data from a separate study presented on Wednesday conducted with Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system, meanwhile, shows that Moderna's vaccine continued to perform well against the Delta variant.
Researchers compared data on more than 352,000 people who got two doses of the Moderna vaccine with the same number of unvaccinated individuals and found the Moderna vaccine was 87% effective at preventing a COVID-19 diagnosis, and 96% effective at preventing hospitalization.

Hoge said the vaccine's initial performance is strong, but argued that protection shouldn't be allowed to wane.
""The first six months are great, but you can't count on that being stable out to a year and beyond,"" he said. (This story corrects year to 2021 from 2022 in 12th paragraph)

The announcement came eight months after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned imports of vaccines made by the United States and Britain - though Iran has since accepted vaccines developed by Western firms but manufactured elsewhere.
President Ebrahim Raisi’s administration is under public pressure to broaden its sources of vaccines as infections mount in its deadliest wave yet.
“The Johnson & Johnson single-dose corona vaccine has been approved,” the head of Iran's Food and Drug Administration, Mohammad Reza Shanehsaz, was quoted as saying by Iranian media. 
He did not say where the vaccine would be produced or refer to the ban.
In January, Khamenei banned the government from importing COVID-19 vaccines from United States and Britain, saying both countries were ""untrustworthy”. He later said the ban was on vaccines made in those countries.
On Thursday, Shanehsaz said Russia’s single-component Sputnik Light vaccine had also been approved.
""Fortunately, the basket of the CORONA vaccines registered in Iran has become very diverse and large,” he added.
Iran is trying to speed up vaccinations by using imported doses - including Sputnik V, India’s Covaxin made by Bharat Biotech, and the British-developed Oxford/AstraZeneca shot produced by Russia’s R-Pharm group and AstraZeneca-SKBio in South Korea. Iran also uses its own COVIran Barakat shot.
The health ministry says 13 million out of a population of 83 million have been fully inoculated. 
Health Minister Bahram Einollahi said on Thursday that Iran had vaccinated 7.9 million people over the past week, state media reported. 
The ministry on Thursday reported 18,021 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing total cases to 5,378,408 in Iran, the worst hit country in the Middle East. There were 6,981 acute cases and deaths rose by 453 over the same period to 116,072.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair lifted its five-year passenger forecast on Thursday, saying the delivery of an existing Boeing (NYSE:BA) order and increased use of older aircraft would allow it to grow faster without the need for an additional large plane deal.
Europe's largest low cost carrier last week abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemaker over a new order of the larger 737 MAX 10 jets, worth tens of billions of dollars, due to differences over price.
Shares of the airline jumped 7% on Thursday after it raised its passenger growth forecast.
""If we don't do another order until 2025, frankly we couldn't care less. The one great thing about the airline industry is we know there's going to be another crisis in five years' time (to drive down jet prices),"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told an analyst call after Ryanair's annual general meeting.
The Irish airline, one of Boeing's biggest customers, will keep talking to the planemaker, O'Leary said in an interview, adding that relations between the two remain ""very good"".
However, O'Leary has said he is willing to wait years for Boeing to drop its prices and on Thursday he said Ryanair had enough aircraft to fly 225 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 200 million previously forecast. 
O'Leary told Reuters that to meet that target Ryanair would sell fewer second-hand planes, on top of the planned delivery of 210 of Boeing's 197-seat MAX 200 model over the next five years. It may also buy or lease a small amount of current generation planes, he added.
Ryanair had been in talks to order 100 of the 230-seat MAX 10 for delivery from 2026 to 2030 with an option for 100 more before the talks were cancelled, O'Leary said.
He added that the boost to its passenger forecast reflected large pent-up demand in Europe and the gaps that have appeared as rivals fail or cut capacity.
Ryanair flew 149 million passengers a year before the pandemic and expects to fly close to 100 million in its financial year to the end of March 2022.
O'Leary said bookings over the coming months were ""patchy"", with some periods of extraordinary demand around school holidays in October and at Christmas, while current prices were low.

However, he said he expected ticket prices for short-haul flights across Europe next summer to be significantly higher than they were before the pandemic because there is about 20% less capacity in the market.
Ryanair's shares were up 7% at 16.49 euros by 1130 GMT, and have gained 7.6% since the start of this year.

Moller-Maersk sees no indication that the current red-hot shipping market will lose steam this year, its chief executive said on Thursday.
Maersk lifted its 2021 outlook again on Thursday, riding the rise in freight rates which has resulted from a congested global supply chain.
The coronavirus pandemic has prompted shortages of container ships and logjams at ports at a time of high consumer spending, sending the cost of transporting freight to record levels.
""Nothing in our data suggests that the situation will change this year,"" Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou told Reuters. He expects global trade volumes to grow 7%-8% this year compared with 2020.
""We see very, very strong end-user demand combined with re-stocking and the fact that capacity in ports, warehouses and on ships is not fully utilized due to COVID-19,"" he said.
Currently, 9%-10% of global container capacity is sitting outside ports waiting to discharge, he said. The problem is particularly acute at Long Beach port in Los Angeles where some 60 container ships are waiting to discharge.

Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, now expects full-year underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $22 billion to $23 billion, up from a previous estimate of $18 billion to $19.5 billion.
The shipping company, which is set to publish full third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2, also reported preliminary earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of close to $7 billion and EBIT of nearly $6 billion.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed, unimpressed by a surprise increase in retail sales in August and the lack of any further improvement in the trend for jobless claims. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially opened up 100 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%. But by 10:26 AM ET, the Dow was down more than 170 points, and the S&P and Nasdaq each had fallen 0.6%.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.7% in August, compared with expectations for a drop of 0.8%. However, July's decline was revised down to 1.8% from 1.1%, partially neutralizing the positive surprise. Initial claims for jobless benefits, meanwhile, ticked up last week to 330,000 from 312,000, consistent with other data points showing a weakening in some pockets of the service sector due to the continued strength of Covid-19 outbreaks in the month.
Recent data have shown a clear drop in new cases in southern states such as Texas and Florida since the start of September, raising hopes that the end of the delta-variant wave of Covid-19 is in sight.
Analysts argued that the retail sales were perhaps stronger than they looked, given that the 1.8% rise in sales excluding autos (which strips out one of the more volatile segments of recent months' data) was up 1.8%, well ahead of the unchanged number expected. 
""The bottom line here is that this report suggests Delta fears aren’t stopping people spending some of their abundant cash resources on goods, even as they retreat from services,"" said Pantheon Economics chief economist Ian Shepherdson, who argued that the numbers ""will trigger a wave of upgrades to forecasts for Q3 consumption and GDP growth.""
While the third quarter is still likely to show much slower growth in general than the previous second month due to the fading of stimulus effects, ""upside surprises on this scale don’t come often, and this one indicates a real degree of resilience on the part of consumers,"" Shepherdson said. 
Among individual stocks,  Dutch Bros  (NYSE:BROS) rose another 15%, the coffee chain adding to the 58% gain it made on its debut on Wednesday.  
Ironnet (NYSE:IRNT) stock continued its rocket-like ascent thanks to a hard squeeze by retail traders.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retailers John Lewis Partnership and the Co-operative Group both warned on Thursday that creaking supply chains would lead to higher prices, as a dearth of truck drivers compounds disruptions in global freight trade.
A combination of the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union on cross-border trade and the wider effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on worldwide transportation has led many retailers to highlight the challenges facing their businesses.
Although the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, which runs John Lewis department stores and supermarket chain Waitrose, returned to a first-half profit after a pandemic-hit loss last year, it warned of ""significant uncertainty"" ahead.
Partnership Chairman Sharon White said the whole retail industry was having to manage global supply chain challenges and labour shortages.
The group was seeing inflationary pressures and expects them to persist.
""We are obviously seeing short-term pressures. We are finding it hard to see how those short-term inflationary pressures are going to be fully eased,"" she told reporters. ""Industry wise, economy wise everybody's staring into a rather cloudy crystal ball at the moment."" 
The partnership was taking measures to mitigate risks and deliver Christmas for customers, including recruiting more full-time drivers and 7,000 temporary seasonal workers as well as booking additional freight capacity.
The Co-op, which runs Britain's sixth-largest supermarket group and also provides funeral and other services, reported a first-half loss and warned that supply chain disruptions would pressure full-year profit.
CEO Steve Murrells joined industry calls for heavy goods vehicle drivers to be added to the shortage occupation list so foreign workers can help plug a shortfall of 90,000.
""This won't be solved in isolation. This is a global issue where the supply chain has completely broken down,"" he told Reuters. 
BIGGEST TEST
John Lewis made a first-half profit before exceptional items of 69 million pounds ($95 million) versus a loss of 55 million pounds in the same period last year, helped by 66 million pounds of cost savings and business-rates relief of 58 million pounds.
Sales rose 6% to 5.87 billion pounds, with department store sales up 12% and Waitrose's sales up 2%.
""We have faced our biggest-ever test and we will come through stronger,"" said White, who set out a five-year recovery plan last October. 
This involves investing 1 billion pounds to expand its online business and improve its stores, diversify beyond retail and seek more partnerships. 
The plan, which is also seeking efficiency savings of 300 million pounds a year by 2022, targets a profit of 400 million pounds by year five.
The Co-op made a first-half underlying operating loss before tax of 15 million pounds versus a 56 million pound profit in the same period last year.
The group has struck a partnership deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that will allow Prime members to buy Co-op products on the Amazon site for home delivery and wants to double online sales to 200 million pounds by the end of the year.

The group has also extended its partnership with Starship Technologies, the delivery robot company, which allows the delivery of groceries in as little as 20 minutes.

The trial, being held in the city of Braunschweig, close to Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, started without former CEO Martin Winterkorn, whose separate trial will take place at a later date.
The four employees, who are accused of fraud, had been aware of the illegal software but failed to raise the issue, instead seeking to maximise profits for the carmaker and, as a result, their performance bonuses, Braunschweig prosecutors said.
The defendants either claim they did not know about the manipulation or had informed their superiors about it, judicial sources said.
Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. diesel engine tests, sparking the biggest crisis in its history. 

It has cost the world's second-largest carmaker more than 32 billion euros ($37.7 billion) in vehicle refits, fines and legal costs so far.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union should allow clearing houses in Britain to continue serving customers in the bloc to avoid a significant risk of market disruption, nine financial industry bodies said on Thursday.
Britain fully left the EU last December and the London Stock Exchange, whose LCH SwapClear arm clears the bulk of swaps denominated in euros, has temporary permission to continue serving customers from the EU until June 30 next year.
Brussels is putting pressure on banks to shift activity worth trillions of euros to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex arm in Frankfurt where it could be directly supervised for any threats to financial stability.
In a letter on Thursday to EU financial services chief Mairead McGuinness, the industry associations call on her to provide certainty to the market by either extending the current temporary permission or granting open-ended permission to allow a ""natural"" shift in business from London to Frankfurt already underway, to continue.
If clearing permission is not extended from June 2022, the LSE would need to give EU customers three months' notice to shift euro clearing outside Britain.
""We would also request the Commission to inform EU market participants of its intention as soon as possible and before March 2022 to address the ongoing uncertainty confronting the Joint Associations' EU clearing members and their clients, which already negatively impacts their clearing business,"" the letter said.
Market bodies SIFMA and AFME, derivatives industry bodies ISDA and FIA, investment industry associations EFAMA, ICI and AIMA, and the European Banking Federation and EAPB banking bodies, said the location of clearing is driven by commercial factors.
""However, we would also note that based on publicly available data we are starting to see a natural, gradual shift of activity to EU CCPs (central counterparties),"" the letter said.
""We would welcome an extension to the current time-limited equivalence decision to allow this natural, market-led shift to continue and also to allow EU CCPs to continue to develop their offering.""
On Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey urged banks to wait, rather than risk financial stability by fragmenting markets by shifting clearing to Frankfurt.

Credit Suisse's (NYSE:CS) $74 is the highest target of the seven and around 29% above the stock’s Wednesday close of $57.56. Analyst Sami Bedri had a target of $56 on the stock earlier.
According to Bedri, current investor sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but he expects the caution to abate as the company executes on its long-term guidance while ramping up its recurring revenue plans. He said the quality embedded in the product orders is higher than investors initially appreciated.
Bedri also expects the company to use its free cash flows for buybacks, something not captured in the guidance yet.

M&S said on Thursday that its remaining nine French franchise stores, run with Lagardere Travel Retail, will continue to trade and the pair were working on a sustainable future business model.
Chairman Archie Norman has complained for months that M&S was struggling to get goods into Ireland and France since Britain left the EU single market at the beginning of the year, due to the huge amount of extra paperwork.
""M&S has a long history of serving customers in France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly,"" Paul Friston, M&S' international director, said.
""As things stand today, the supply chain complexities in place following the UK’s exit from the European Union, now make it near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers to the high standards they expect, resulting in an ongoing impact to the performance of our business,"" he added.
The 11 stores that will close by the end of this year are located predominantly across the high streets of Paris, while the nine run by Lagardere are located in travel hubs such as airports, railway and metro stations.
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the Brexit process. 
""We believe that the approach we have taken is the correct one. It is something that the public voted for and it is already bringing benefits to the public,"" the spokesperson said.
The government had also provided significant funding, advice and support throughout the Brexit period so companies could prepare and understand the changes, they added.
In April, M&S reconfigured its food business in the Czech Republic to remove supply chain risks. It took all fresh and chilled products from its stores, and doubled ranges of frozen and ambient products.

Last month, M&S upgraded its profit outlook after a jump in demand for food in its home market and a surge in online clothes sales indicated that its latest turnaround plan was starting to deliver.
M&S shares were down 2% at 1237 GMT, paring their 2021 gains to 33.6%.

From delayed car deliveries to a supply shortfall in home appliances and smartphones, businesses and consumers across the world have been facing the consequences of an unprecedented shortage https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/when-chips-are-down-global-shortage-keep-crimping-carmakers-2021-08-03 in semiconductor microchips.
In the Czech Republic, production has been hit in the auto sector, a key driver of the economy. Skoda has thousands of cars unfinished as it waits for chips.
""Recent COVID-19 outbreaks in Asia, for example in Malaysia, are forcing semiconductor manufacturers to close their factories again. This has resulted in industry-wide adjustments to car production, and SKODA AUTO is also affected,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters questions.
""We will therefore stop our production lines in the Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny plant in calendar week 39.""
It did comment on any impact on its third Czech site, components factory at Vrchlabi.
The head of Skoda's union, Jaroslav Povsik, had earlier told a union newsletter that cancelled shifts would be added to planned holidays on Sept. 27-28 to mark a state holiday. 
Skoda said it expected semiconductor production to be ramped up in the fourth quarter.
""We expect the overall supply situation to ease by the end of the year,"" it said.
Skoda is one of three carmakers in the central European country. The other two are South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Toyota has also been forced to halt production at its Czech plant for periods in the past few months.
While manufacturers have had to grapple with global supply and transport bottlenecks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Czech economy has returned to solid growth after a massive contraction in 2020.

Manufacturing sentiment has also stayed strong, but has slipped from records seen in earlier this year.
Volkswagen's Spanish unit SEAT plans to extend partial car assembly suspensions at its plants near Barcelona well into 2022 because of the chip shortage.

Bhutada was found guilty of sharing information about billionaire Adar Poonawalla-owned Rising Sun Holdings' proposed stake buy in the company before it was public knowledge, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said in an interim order https://www.sebi.gov.in/enforcement/orders/sep-2021/in-the-matter-of-magma-fincorp-limited-now-known-as-poonawalla-fincorp-limited_52613.html on Wednesday.
Bhutada denied the allegations in an email sent to the company, an exchange filing showed. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Thursday.
Rising Sun Holdings acquired earlier this year a majority stake in Poonawalla Fincorp, formerly called Magma Fincorp, via preferential issue of up to 34.56 billion rupees ($470.62 million). Bhutada was at the time the chief executive officer of Poonawalla Finance, a private unit of Rising Sun Holdings.
Based on call records, financial dealings and bank statements, the SEBI said it found that several entities related to Bhutada traded in Magma stocks before details of the stake buy were disclosed to the stock exchanges.

(Reuters) -Online fashion retailer ASOS (LON:ASOS) set out plans to cut its environmental impact and improve worker rights on Thursday, tying its success in cutting waste and carbon levels to future management pay. 
Joining a growing list of fast-fashion companies to open up its supply chain for external scrutiny, ASOS set out targets for improving recycling rates, cutting energy usage and increasing the diversity of its corporate leaders.
Like Primark which produced a similar plan on Wednesday, ASOS must overhaul operations in Asia, Europe, the United States and elsewhere without threatening the ultra-low prices or rapid delivery times that have won over an army of young shoppers.
The new mission statements follow calls from shareholders, governments and socially aware customers for companies to identify their environmental impact and then cut the use of water and chemicals, and reduce the millions of tonnes of throw-away clothing that end up in landfill. 
""The responsibility for a sustainable future lies with all of us and businesses must lead the way,"" CEO Nick Beighton said, adding that ASOS needed to work with other brands, civil society organisations and governments to deliver change. 
Under the plan ASOS aims to achieve net zero status across all its operations and be making own-brand products and packaging from more sustainable or recycled materials by 2030.
It will also seek to improve human rights within its supply chain by producing an annual report from 2023 that addresses such issues as wages, modern slavery and gender empowerment, to be assessed by independent campaign groups. 
The fast-fashion industry, which has been turbocharged by online ordering and instant delivery, has come under fire for causing an estimated 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Worker conditions in the textile industry have also come under the spotlight since the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh that killed more than 1,000 workers.
Many environmental campaigners are sceptical about green pledges from major brands, believing they do not fit with a sector that churns out items for little more than a few pounds. ASOS sells over 85,000 products in 200 markets.
But Beighton said he remained proud of the industry, because it brings people confidence and joy, and it employed millions.

ASOS, which launched an original plan in 2010, said that while the updated programme could lead to modest increases in costs it was confident that technology would offset this. 
From 2022, progress against the goals will form part of the executive team's objectives, alongside the wider business performance, influencing their remuneration.

The brokerage reportedly downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from 'overweight' with a tag of $125, a cut of around 13% from its previous target price. It's also about 13% higher than the stock’s Wednesday close. 
Analyst Michael Lavery said he was concerned about retail demand, saying earnings estimates for 2021 are at risk. Reports said he is concerned about the firm’s efficiency in the current half of the year as data indicate “another quarter of under-shipments”.
The company is currently guiding for around $130 million in sales this quarter, an increase of some 38% on the year.
Early last month, the company said embedded in the guidance were expectations of a moderation in growth after food outlets replenished their inventories. It also warned of distribution and operator challenges due to labor issues.
Lavery also believes its plant-based meat lacks the visibility of a Burger King’s ‘Impossible Whopper’ even though he sees the opportunity in its partnership with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) as “real”.

Evergrande, which has total liabilities of more than $300 billion, is also in the spotlight as it scrambles to raise funds, teetering between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or a government bailout. 
""Tether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,"" the company said. 
""The vast majority of the commercial paper held by Tether is in A-2 and above rated issuers.""

(Reuters) - A New Jersey state treasury official said on Wednesday it is set to divest $182 million in Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc stock and bonds held by its pension funds over the restriction of sales by the consumer giant's Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
It is the latest action by a U.S. state challenging Unilever over Ben & Jerry's move in July to end a license for its ice cream to be sold in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Ben & Jerry's said selling its products there was ""inconsistent with its values.""
New Jersey's Division of Investment had said on Tuesday it made a preliminary determination that maintaining its investment in Unilever would be a breach of a state law barring it from investing in companies boycotting Israel. It gave the company 90 days to request a modification of the order. 
A Unilever representative said it had no comment on the state decision, but cited a letter to the state from CEO Alan Jope from August stating Unilever has ""a strong and longlasting commitment to our business in Israel,"" where it employs nearly 2,000 people.
Jope noted Ben & Jerry's has an independent board overseeing its social mission, and said Unilever does not support the ""Boycott Divestment Sanctions"" movement that seeks to isolate Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians. The decision to stop selling ice cream was made by Ben & Jerry's and its board, Jope said.
A Ben & Jerry's spokesman did not respond to messages.
Many countries consider Israeli settlements on Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
Ben & Jerry's, based in South Burlington, Vermont, is known for its commitment to social justice that has recently included strongly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, LGBTQ+ rights and electoral campaign finance reform.

It was acquired by Unilever in 2000 in a deal that allows it to operate with more autonomy than other subsidiaries, including giving powers to an independent board to make decisions over its social mission, brand integrity and policies.
Arizona state Treasurer Kimberly Yee said earlier this month the state would sell $143 million in Unilever holdings for similar reasons.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Television may have been what helped people get through the lockdowns and quarantines of the past year, but the Emmy Awards themselves just can't seem to get a break.
Forced for a second year to abandon the traditional mass gathering of celebrities and executives, Cedric the Entertainer will host a scaled-back show in Los Angeles on Sunday that has been moved to an outdoor tent because of concerns over the Delta variant.
Despite vaccination, testing and masking requirements, Jennifer Aniston is among those who won't be attending, citing her personal safety. And many of the cast of drama series favorite ""The Crown"" will likely take part from London, organizers said.
""We do have some people wanting to dial in, and we understand that,"" Maury McIntyre, president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, told Variety this week.
""It's only about 500 in the tent, but 500 is still a lot for some people,"" McIntyre said.
Last year, the Emmys was held virtually with celebrities joining remotely from homes, gardens and hotel rooms around the world rather than the usual in-person event for more than 4,000 people.
Television viewing exploded during the pandemic, sending people stuck at home to vast libraries of content on streaming platforms.
""Ted Lasso,"" a heartwarming comedy about a fish-out-of-water American coaching a struggling British soccer team, and British royal series ""The Crown,"" are expected to be some of the beneficiaries this year.
""Ted Lasso"" scored 20 Emmys nods, including best comedy series, and nominations for lead actor Jason Sudeikis and six other actors.
""'Ted Lasso' is old-fashioned, shamelessly lovable and full of wonderful twists and turns,"" said Tom O'Neil, founder of awards website Goldderby.com. ""It has unflagging optimism all the time even when things seem really, really bad.""
The show could deliver the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ streaming platform its first major win.
After a compelling season that focused on the unhappy marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, ""The Crown"" nabbed 24 Emmy nods. Awards experts predict it will take home its first best drama series Emmy, clinching a milestone win for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
""If 'The Crown' and 'Ted Lasso' both end up winning the best TV series race, it will mark the total conquest of television by the streaming services,"" O' Neil said.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Hulu previously won the TV series prizes for ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" respectively.
""I would be shocked if 'The Crown' did not win,"" said Gerrad Hall, senior TV editor at Entertainment Weekly. ""It was a stellar season and every single performance on that show is awards-worthy.""
""The Crown"" will compete for best drama series - the top award - against ""Star Wars"" TV spinoff ""The Mandalorian"" featuring the beloved Baby Yoda, ""Bridgerton,"" ""The Boys,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" ""Pose,"" ""Lovecraft Country"", and the sole mainstream network series ""This is Us.""
Streaming services also dominate the limited series field, which pundits say is too close to call.
""These limited series are prestige TV,"" said Hall, referring to ""I May Destroy You,"" ""Mare of Easttown,"" ""The Queen's Gambit,"" ""WandaVision"" and ""The Underground Railroad.""

""Every single one of the nominated shows are female-driven stories, and showcasing such a variety of themes,"" Hall added.
The Emmy Awards will be broadcast live on CBS on Sept. 19, starting at 8p.m. ET (0000 GMT).

The country's second biggest property developer is wrestling with a liquidity crisis, scrambling to raise funds as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or a government bailout.
Disgruntled Evergrande investors as well as vendors who say they are owed money have gathered this week at company headquarters in the southern city and reportedly elsewhere in China.
""Every day we're here waiting for some sort of policy for us but nothing comes, so we have no choice but to stay,"" one protester said.
Uniformed security could be seen detaining at least two among about two dozen protesters and forming a circle around those who remained, locking arms so that none could leave while the two were taken away.
Security personnel responded to sporadic chants of ""Evergrande return our money"" by waving a banner that said ""police evidence"" while an officer filmed the protesters who were shouting.
During a thunderstorm, a crying woman who was sitting among remaining protesters and approaching security personnel was carried away to a nearby police van.

Earlier on Thursday, Evergrande's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co Ltd, applied to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade.

(Reuters) -Cigarette maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) (PMI) clinched its 1.1 billion-pound takeover of asthma inhaler maker Vectura on Thursday, winning the support of the British company's shareholders despite the concerns of health professionals.
Vectura's shareholders decided to take the 165 pence-per-share offer from PMI, with nearly 75% backing the deal.
Buying the London-listed inhaler maker is part of Philip Morris' long term plan to develop ""smoke-free"" products and switch to being a ""broader healthcare and wellness"" company.
But it has angered health groups such as Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation that have questioned whether a tobacco group should own a company that cures the very respiratory illnesses cigarettes cause.
PMI Chief Executive Jacek Olczak has argued that acquiring Vectura is a critical part of his strategy to move the company ""Beyond Nicotine"".
He told the Telegraph last month that opponents of the deal were ""not interested in progress"" and accused them of ""settling old scores"" with the tobacco industry. 
Olczak said on Thursday PMI would provide Vectura's scientists with the resources and expertise to reach its goal of generating at least $1 billion in net revenue from ""Beyond Nicotine"" products by 2025.
In the meantime, Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said they have sent a letter urging the government to look into any conflict of interest issues. 
The letter was co-signed by 35 charities, public health experts and clinicians. 
""There's now a very real risk that Vectura's deal with big tobacco will lead to the cigarette industry wielding undue influence on UK health policy,"" said Sarah Woolnough, Chief Executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation.
""We call on the government to stand by its commitment to the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to prevent this happening,"" Woolnough added.
PMI has received regulatory clearances for the deal and following the public tender process, its offer cannot now be withdrawn. 
While the company received the 50% threshold to make its offer unconditional, it has not yet reached the 75% of shares it needs to delist Vectura.
PMI said it was extending its offer to Sept 30., to give Vectura shareholders time to accept its proposal. 

""Phillip Morris isn't ignoring the elephant; it's making us all take a long hard look. Discomfort is good, it tends to deliver change, but care must be taken that the promised change does come and there are no detours on the journey,"" AJ Bell financial analyst Danni Hewson said.

Investing.com – Electronic Arts stock (NASDAQ:EA) looked like recouping at least some of its Wednesday losses after the company confirmed a modest delay to the launch of its eagerly-awaited Battlefield 2042 game.
“We’ve made the decision to shift the launch of Battlefield 2042. The game will now be released worldwide on November 19th, 2021,” the company’s note said. It was earlier scheduled on October 22.
The stock traded 1.8% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the company’s note on the release date of the video game calmed both traders and fans. The stock fell nearly 6% in the previous session as social media swirled with speculation that the launch might be pushed back to next year.
The company blamed the pandemic for the delay as that held back the return of its team to the studios. It said the team is putting “some finishing touches into the experience” and updates on the open beta will be coming later this month.
Battlefield 2042 is a multi-player game themed around U.S. and Russia being on the brink of a war as climate change leads to intensified competition for scarce resources."
1013,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>","U.S. Futures Edge Lower; Retail Sales, Jobless Claims in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Thursday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains, with investors cautious ahead of the release of key retail sales and unemployment data, and increasingly unsettled by a European energy crisis that is pulling global prices higher.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 30 points, or 0.2%.
The broad-based S&P 500 index gained 0.9% Wednesday, its biggest daily increase in more than two weeks, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced more than 200 points, or 0.7%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8%.
However, those gains have been something of an outlier so far in September, with the Dow down 1.6%, the S&P 500 off just under 1% and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5%.
While September is traditionally a weak month, there have been a number of specific influences weighing on sentiment, including the highly-transmissible delta variant, regulatory concerns in China, supply chain difficulties and the possibility of central banks reining in monetary stimulus. Some money has also been moving out of established names for redeployment in a spate of IPOs, such as Dutch Bros  (NYSE:BROS) and Thoughtworks.
There’s more economic data Thursday for investors to study for clues as the Federal Reserve prepares for its monetary policy-setting meeting next week.
Retail sales, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), are expected to have weakened again in August, dropping 0.8% on the month after July’s 1.1% fall. At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims are seen rising to 330,000 last week, from 310,000 for the week before.
In corporate news,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose slightly premarket after the drugmaker revealed a large trial showed the protection its Covid-19 vaccine offers wanes over time, supporting the case for booster doses.
Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) will also be in the spotlight after the video game company announced late Wednesday that its highly-anticipated game Battlefield 2042 game is set for a worldwide launch in November, countering fears that it would be put off to next year.
Crude prices slightly weakened Thursday, consolidating after the previous session’s strong gains on the back of a sharp drawdown in crude stocks in the United States, to their lowest level in over three years.
Crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration late Wednesday, as refiners in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico struggled to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $72.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $57.37. Both contracts gained around 3% on Wednesday, and are up nearly 50% year-to-date.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,780.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1776.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) -EU competition regulators secured a big win on Thursday when Europe's top court backed their crackdown on Belgium's 700-million-euro ($825-million) tax scheme for Magnetrol, BP (NYSE:BP) and more than 30 other multinationals.
European competition chief Margrethe Vestager launched a fight against sweetheart tax deals nearly a decade ago. She has won three cases at a lower tribunal but lost two, including an order to iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in Irish back taxes which was dismissed by the tribunal last year.
The European Union executive, the European Commission, ordered Belgium in 2016 to recover some 700 million euros from companies which benefited from the scheme. These included U.S. manufacturer Magnetrol, oil company BP, chemical producer BASF, Wabco, Cellio, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Copco and Belgacom, now Proximus.
The EU competition watchdog said the series of tax rulings given to the companies constituted an aid scheme. 
The EU Court of Justice (CJEU) agreed with the Commission's arguments, saying the General Court, which in 2019 annulled the Commission's decision, had made several legal errors.
""The Commission correctly found that there was an aid scheme,"" judges said.
They said the regulator's sample of 22 tax rulings from a total of 66 was enough to show a systematic approach by Belgian authorities.
The final verdict in the case will still take some time, said Koen Platteau, a partner at law firm Simmons + Simmons.
""This is not the end of the judicial review process since the case is now referred back to the General Court which will have to decide on the other arguments invoked by Belgium, including on the existence of state aid,"" he said.
Judges referred the case back to the lower tribunal, telling it to examine whether the scheme can be classified as state aid and whether regulators were correct to order the recovery of the aid.
Following the General Court ruling, the Commission in 2019 opened separate investigations into 39 companies which benefited from the Belgian tax rulings while also appealing the judgment.
Other ongoing EU cases include Ikea and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s Dutch tax affairs and Luxembourg's tax treatment of Finnish company Huhtamaki.

The case is C-337/19 P Commission v Belgium and Magnetrol International.

VICTORIA, Canada (Reuters) - Docked at a Canadian port, crew members returned from a test run of the Ocean Cleanup's system to rid the Pacific of plastic trash were thrilled by the meager results — even as marine scientists and other ocean experts doubted the effort could succeed. 
The non-profit, launched in 2013 amid buoyant media coverage, hopes to clear 90% of floating plastic from the world's oceans by 2040. But the group's own best-case scenario — still likely years away — envisions removing 20,000 tonnes a year from the North Pacific, a small fraction of the roughly 11 million tonnes of plastic flowing annually into the oceans. 
And that amount entering the ocean is expected to nearly triple to 29 million tonnes annually by 2040, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/press-releases-and-statements/2020/07/23/research-finds-plastic-flows-into-the-ocean-expected-to-triple-by-2040.
The Ocean Cleanup, funded by cash donations and corporations including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), as well as in-kind donors like A.P. Moller-Maersk, had fixed assets over $51 million (43 million euros) at the end of 2020. 
During 120 hours of deployment last month, System 002 — or ""Jenny"" as the crew nicknamed it — scooped up 8.2 tonnes of plastic, or less than a garbage truck’s standard haul. The Ocean Cleanup spokesperson Joost Dubois described the amount as ""on the high end of our estimates"" and emphasized that it was still just in the test phase. 
""I think they’re coming from a good place of wanting to help the ocean, but by far the best way to help the ocean is to prevent plastic from getting in the ocean in the first place,"" said Miriam Goldstein, director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress think tank.
""Once plastic has gotten into the open ocean, it becomes very expensive and fossil-fuel intensive to get it back out again.""
GARBAGE GYRE
The Ocean Cleanup's first target is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the world’s largest swirling mass of marine debris spanning 1.6 million square kilometers in the North Pacific between California and Hawaii. The group estimates the patch holds at least 79,000 tonnes of plastic. 
If the flow of plastic into the ocean continues unabated, the seas will contain more plastic mass than fish by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/01/more-plastic-than-fish-in-the-ocean-by-2050-report-offers-blueprint-for-change. 
The Ocean Cleanup, created by Dutch inventor Boyan Slat when he was 18, initially planned on using an autonomous floating system driven by wind, waves and currents to remove plastic. But that first system, named Wilson, bobbed ineffectively alongside the garbage until it ultimately broke. A later design, System 001B, was more efficient, but the team estimated they would need 150 such systems to clear the patch at a high cost.
With the Jenny system, two fuel-powered Maersk vessels tow the 520-meter wide horseshoe-shaped catchment system across the ocean surface. An underwater camera helps make sure marine life does not become entangled. 
""Jenny has outperformed everything we've done so far,"" Dubois said of the recent six-week trials, during which the system picked up plastics small as 1 centimeter in diameter.
The Ocean Cleanup hopes eventually to deploy 10 to 15 expanded-range Jennys — powered by 20 to 30 ships — to operate round the clock 365 days a year at the garbage patch. At that scale, organizers say, the effort could recover between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of plastic a year, though it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The group regrets its reliance on ships that release climate-warming greenhouse emissions. The Ocean Cleanup is purchasing carbon credits to offset the heavy fuel use and noted that Maersk is experimenting with less-polluting biofuels https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maersk-emissions/worlds-largest-container-shipper-maerskaims-to-be-co2-neutral-by-2050-idUSKBN1O40QW. ""Preferably we would have done something without any carbon footprint,"" Dubois said. 
Maersk told Reuters that, because of the patch's harsh and remote location, large vessels were needed to assist Jenny's operations. 
""We see the value in not just the outcome of Ocean Cleanup's programs, but also the iterative learning process,"" said Robin Townley, head of special project logistics at Maersk. 
'WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE TRASH YOU COLLECT?'
Prone to seasickness, the Ocean Cleanup's founder Slat does not often venture out onto the open ocean. 
""The plastic that is already in the ocean — accumulated in those garbage patches — is not going away by itself,” Slat told Reuters. ""It has to be removed if we want to return to clean oceans."" 
Marine scientists have long lambasted Slat's vision. Marcus Eriksen, co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, a plastic pollution research organization in California, expressed frustration that ""this downstream, end-of-the-line narrative (is) still (getting) a lot of attention.""
He noted the group's funding comes from companies ""that are actually making the products and packaging. They don't really like the preventative story because it impacts their bottom line.""
Coca-Cola, ranked as the world's largest plastic polluter by environmental groups, helps fund the Ocean Cleanup's side initiative of using solar-powered ""interceptors"" to catch plastic in Asian and Caribbean riverways before it reaches the ocean.
""We've been clear that we want to be part of the solution in addressing the critical issue of packaging waste, rather than part of the problem,"" said Ben Jordan, senior director of environmental policy for Coca-Cola. ""We're making progress, but we still have much further to go."" 
Coca-Cola has committed to reduce the use of new plastic https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-coca-cola/coca-cola-turns-to-100-recycled-plastic-bottles-in-u-s-idUSKBN2A921L in its packaging by 20% in the next four years.
While Eriksen said river cleanup was a more worthwhile goal, he bristled at the involvement of a company that is producing 3 million tonnes of plastic packaging a year. ""It’s exactly that sort of greenwashing narrative.""
The effort's other confounding issue? ""What do you do with the trash you collect?"" Eriksen said.

The small plastic haul from the System 001B was used to make $200 sunglasses, sold on the Ocean Cleanup's website. 
In the future, the Ocean Cleanup hopes to partner with consumer brands to reuse salvaged plastic, Dubois said, though ""we may have to incinerate"" some.

Investing.com – Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) traded 1.6% lower in Thursday’s premarket after a report said the company has lost 30% of its daily users since July when the authorities in its home country began their crackdown on the company.
According to  Aurora Mobile  (NASDAQ:JG), a data solutions platform which researches the behavior of Chinese mobile users, Didi’s average daily user count fell to 10.9 million in August from 15.6 million in June.
A few days after the company listed on the NYSE on June 30, regulators in China banned the company from signing up new customers while they carried out a probe into its data handling practices. That exercise continues. Regulators also ordered app stores to remove 25 of Didi’s other apps.
The shares were issued to the public at $14 apiece and have rarely traded above that price. As per their Wednesday closing, they traded 41% below the issue price.
Based on its historical rate of sign-ups, the ban on opening new accounts is depriving Didi of about 4 million users every month.
A report in The Wall Street Journal in July said the regulators were miffed with the ride-hailing company as it had ignored their advice against going public pending their investigation.
Since the ban, authorities in China have further tightened rules governing the ride-hailing industry. The rules make it mandatory for companies to on-board only licensed drivers and stricter fines for non-compliance.

The plan marks Citroen's return to India, a market it left in the 1930s, and comes at a time when some other foreign carmakers are leaving the country after struggling to make a profit.
Stellantis, which was formed earlier this year by the merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-maker PSA, has brands like Jeep and Ram in the United States, but is still aiming to reduce its reliance on Europe.
The company said it plans to produce a new version of the Citroen C3, positioned as a city car in Europe, in India and Latin America for launch in the second half of 2022.
The model will be produced in India, through a joint venture with CK Birla, and in Brazil.
Citroen said it would be the first of three models which it will produce and aim at India and Latin America over the next three years. 
Stellantis has said it expects India to become the world's third biggest car market after China and the United States by 2030 with total new cars in the country reaching 4-5 million cars a year.

Still, the country has proved challenging for many foreign carmakers, which compete with local manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki there as well as South Korea's Hyundai. Ford last week said it was stopping production in India.
Stellantis aims to grow sales outside Europe to 30% of its revenue by the middle of this decade, compared to 15% now.

Thales has a 35% stake in French military shipyard Naval Group which was due to supply submarines to Australia in a $40 billion deal jettisoned in favour of a new cooperation pact between the United States, Britain and Australia.
""Thales does not expect any material impact of this announcement on the group’s 2021 EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) through Naval Group’s contribution,"" it said. 
Thales, which makes acoustic sonar for warships, was also due to supply sub-systems to  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) as part of the Australian contract, independently of its stake in DCNS.
But Thales said on Thursday the corresponding order book so far was just 30 million euros ($35 million), which was also not material.
Defence contracts typically generate revenue spread out over a number of years. 
Thales confirmed 2021 targets including a book-to-bill ratio above 1, sales in the range of 15.8-16.3 billion euros and an operating margin of 9.8-10.3%. It also reaffirmed its medium-term outlook including a 12% operating margin.
Shares in Europe's largest defence electronics supplier rose 1.3%, slightly ahead of the rest of the market, as analysts said it had acted quickly to quell any uncertainty surrounding the axing of the export contract.
Some analysts said concerns had been raised over the speed at which the deal was being implemented and the pace of French technology transfers towards Australia, with the United States and Britain agreeing to transfer precious nuclear know-how.
""It gives Thales a headwind in one of their most important non-European markets. They had expected a large order intake which they will need to replace with something else,"" said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa.
The United States, Britain and Australia said they would establish a security partnership for the Indo-Pacific that would now involve Australia acquiring U.S. nuclear-powered submarines, resulting in the scrapping of the French deal.
France had lobbied intensively to win one of the world's most lucrative defence contracts against competition from Japan and Germany in 2016, with Thales at the time hailing a ""great day"" for France's defence industry.
After winning the deal, DCNS said it would create around 4,000 French jobs, benefiting shipyards and industrial sites in Lorient, Brest, Nantes and Cherbourg.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>","Asia supercharges vaccination efforts after slow start, U.S. lags","By Rocky Swift and Aradhana Aravindan
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Several Asian nations are quickly ramping up vaccination campaigns from shaky starts to combat growing COVID-19 infections, as supply shipments roll in and people overcome hesitancy in hopes of easing curbs and freeing up travel. 
Japan and South Korea have passed the United States in terms of those who have received at least one dose and are fast catching up with the second.
And Australia, which is targeting high vaccination rates in its drive to escape lockdowns and re-open borders, has given 56% of people at least one shot as infections peak. 
""That 70% double dose and 80% double dose mark is within plain sight,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told media on Thursday in the capital, Canberra. ""Keep going, Australia."" 
While each country's inoculation strategies differ, Asia's momentum reflects pent-up demand for the shots as a means to ease lockdowns, said Paul Griffin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Queensland in northeast Australia.
Australia is giving priority supplies to its largest cities, which are in lockdown to contain a third wave of infections fuelled by the Delta variant. It expects to have enough to complete vaccinations of those older than 12 by mid-October.
Japan has overcome initial logistics hurdles to give https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-city-uses-tsunami-lessons-covid-19-vaccinations-2021-06-11 about a million shots a day since mid-June, as urgency has grown after Delta unleashed an unprecedented wave of infections and serious cases in August.
""That obviously accelerated the vaccination motivation, particularly in young and middle-age groups,"" said Takahiro Kinoshita, a physician and official of vaccine information group Cov-Navi.
Japan's vaccination rate reflected a push to ""return to a normal way of life,"" Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who will step down this month after a one-year tenure marred by an unpopular COVID-19 response, said on Thursday.
Vaccine take-up was also boosted by consistent public messaging to counter health scares that have doomed similar previous drives, said Fumie Sakamoto, an infection control manager at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo.
CARROT AND STICK
Still, experts agree that vaccinations will plateau everywhere.
For instance, the United States and Britain, which had raced ahead to vaccinate millions of people a couple of months ago, are now seeing stagnating inoculation rates as large swathes of their populations reject the shots. 
To counter the slowdown and a groundswell of anti-vaccine sentiment, U.S. President Joe Biden announced https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/how-will-bidens-vaccine-mandate-impact-workers-companies-2021-09-13 new mandates this week.
""I think they don't have that same incentive that perhaps we do (in Australia), where we relied on very harsh restrictions to keep people safe ... and are being told our only ticket to freedom is to have high levels of vaccination,"" said Griffin.
China, where more than 70% of the population have received both doses, said this month that it was difficult to expand its vaccination drive but did not say where the roadblocks were.
In wealthy Singapore, the most inoculated nation in Asia with more than 80% people fully vaccinated, is turning its focus to booster doses as infections spike. 
While there are some holdouts, especially among the elderly and those worried about side effects from the new mRNA vaccines, people have a high level of trust in the government, which helps with compliance.

The breakthrough followed 10 days of secret talks in which the governors of two German regional states were brought in to bridge differences between the GdL train drivers' union and management of the loss-making state railways.
The compromise package, which has a 32-month duration, features pay rises totalling 3.3%, a series of one-off coronavirus hardship payments and a pension deal.
""We have untied the Gordian knot,"" Deutsche Bahn personnel chief Martin Seiler told a news conference. Standing alongside him, GdL leader Claus Weselsky said the strike action had been justified in achieving the hard-fought compromise.

The most recent week-long stoppage forced the cancellation of three-quarters of long-distance trains and disrupted industrial supply chains already under strain as the economy recovers from last year's pandemic shock.
Stefan Weil, Social Democrat state premier of Lower Saxony state, and Daniel Guenther, the conservative leader of Schleswig-Holstein, paused campaigning for this month's general election to help broker the breakthrough.

Investing.com – Shares of major European airlines traded higher Thursday on reports the U.K. will scrap mandatory pre-departure Covid-19 tests for entry into the region.
Ryanair ADRs (NASDAQ:RYAAY) rose 4.2% on Nasdaq in premarket session, while EasyJet (LON:EZJ), British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) all traded around 3% higher in London.  
A report in The Telegraph said current ‘traffic light’ system of restrictions will be simplified to aid the tourist industry, ahead of the autumn half-term break at the end of October.
According to the report, this should see the green and amber lists of countries merge into a single category. This will enable double-jabbed Britons’ quarantine-free travel to other countries. The red category, for countries the government advises against visiting, may remain.
The new system will also help in individually determining the risk profile of a traveler compared to the previous scenario that was country-specific.
The easing of restrictions should provide a much-needed boost to a travel industry whose key summer tourism season was depressed by onerous testing requirements that put many people off travelling. The U.K. is among the most vaccinated countries in the world and was recovering well from the pandemic until the delta variant struck in June-July.  "

The company and its U.S. rival Blue Apron, along with food delivery companies Delivery Hero and Just Eat Takeaway, have been among lockdown winners, as pandemic curbs that shut restaurants led to more people ordering food online. 
The planned expansion, which the blue-chip company said would double its tech team, comes at a time when firms across the world are facing a shortage in labour as economies come out of months-long restrictions. 
Dominik Richter, who co-founded HelloFresh with Thomas Griesel and Jessica Nilsson a decade back, acknowledged in an e-mail to Reuters that the job market, especially for technology roles, was very competitive now.

""The deterioration in the supply of semiconductors now requires reorganizing, planning and adopting new labour protocols,"" SEAT said, adding it had started negotiating a furlough plan with local unions to cancel some working shifts between Sept. 27 and June 30, 2022.
The chip supply disruptions come as demand for the SEAT and CUPRA brands is back at pre-pandemic levels, Xavier Ros, the company's vice president for human resources, said.
The company slowed production in the first half of the year, then exceptionally opened the factories in August to offset the shortfall, but was eventually forced to idle part of its operation in late August.
Carmakers around the world have been forced to reduce the pace of production in recent months due to a lack of chips, caused by pandemic-related supply shocks, lockdowns in key production hubs and high demand in the consumer electronics industry.

Automakers from U.S. group General Motors (NYSE:GM) to India's Mahindra, Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies.
Volkswagen said last month it expected the situation to improve by the end of this year and aimed to make up for production shortfalls in the second half as far as possible, but the chips crunch is not abating.

""TSMC is deeply aware that climate change has a severe impact on the environment and humanity. As a world-leading semiconductor company, TSMC must shoulder its corporate responsibility to face the challenge of climate change,"" Chairman Mark Liu said in a statement.
The company, which counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc amongst its major clients, will ""set related mitigation measures"" and actively adopt the use of renewable energy, it added.
TSMC said it has set the short-term goal of zero emissions growth by 2025.
""TSMC will continue actively evaluating and investing in all types of opportunities to reduce carbon emissions.""
Tsai said in April that the government had begun to assess how the island can reach zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, after environmental groups criticised the government for not doing enough to fight climate change.
Taiwan's previous target, set in 2015, was to halve emissions between 2005 and 2050.
Last year, coal provided 45% of Taiwan's electricity, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) a close second at almost 36%, according to the economy ministry.

Coal's contribution to Taiwan's power mix is set to fall to below 30% by 2025, with the proportion of LNG rising to around 50% and renewables to 20%, from just 5.4% last year, according to government plans.
Last year, Greenpeace called on tech powerhouse Taiwan to be much more aggressive in tackling climate change, in the face of the subtropical island's risks from extreme weather and rising sea levels.

Canal+ owner Vivendi, which already owns 27% of Lagardere, said it had agreed to buy Amber Capital's 17.9% holding for 24.10 euros per share, or about 610 million euros ($718.95 million).
Vivendi said it would later launch a full bid at the same price once it has passed the 30% threshold requiring companies in France to make a takeover offer.
""We believe Vivendi is primarily interested in Lagardere's International Publishing business which would bring scale, synergies & savings to Editis"", analysts at JP Morgan said in a note.
They also said that Vivendi would likely seek to sell the travel retail business to fund the acquisition.
If successful, the acquisition of Lagardere will mark the end of what was once one of France's national industrial champions, which under its late founder used to have large stakes in companies like plane maker Airbus.

Heir and Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere has sold off parts of the conglomerate bit by bit. Last year he brought in investors like Vivendi and luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault when he was trying to fend off an activist campaign by Amber Capital.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Shares of  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea Ltd surged nearly 20% and banks with exposure to the telecom firm jumped on Thursday, a day after India's federal cabinet approved a relief package for the troubled sector.
A four-year moratorium on airwaves payments due to the government and raising the tenure of airwaves held by firms were a part of the package, along with a change in the contentious definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) to exclude non-telecom income.
Analysts said that the measures could restore the idea of a three-player telecom market for the time being, but it does not provide a long-term solution.
""For long-term sustainability, Vodafone Idea will require not only capital infusion, but a sizeable tariff hike for 4G pre-paid customers. In the absence of this, the industry can slip towards a duopoly,"" said Pranav Kshatriya, vice president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities.
Troubles for the telecom sector, which had already been disrupted by the entry of billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio and forced some rivals out of the market, had been compounded with the huge dues to be paid to the government. 
Vodafone Idea, a combination of the India unit of Britain's Vodafone Group (LON:VOD) and domestic telecoms firm Idea Cellular, alone still owes the government about 500 billion rupees ($6.81 billion).
Shares of the company climbed 20% to their highest since June 29, while rival Bharti Airtel rose up to 1.4% before shedding early gains.

IDFC  First Bank  (NASDAQ:FRBA), Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank, which, as per Nomura, have exposures to Vodafone Idea at 3%, 2.4% and 1.7% of their loan books, respectively, climbed as much as between 5% and 13%. Analysts say the default risk has been largely taken out in the near medium term.

Also, earnings are expected from the likes of John Lewis (LON:JLH),  Kier Group  (LON:KIE) and Superdry (LON:SDRY).
Economic data are thin on the ground in Europe Thursday, and a lot of the attention will be on the release of U.S. August retail sales and weekly initial jobless claims for clues of the health of the important U.S. economy.
Crude prices edged higher Thursday, extending recent strong gains after a sharp drawdown in crude stocks in the United States, the largest oil consumer in the world.
Crude inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration late Wednesday, as refiners in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico struggled to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $72.62 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.52. Both contracts gained around 3% on Wednesday, and are up nearly 50% year-to-date.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,786.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1805.

(Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's top lender, said on Thursday it would plead guilty to 30 charges brought against it in the federal court for mis-selling consumer credit insurance (CCI) to its customers.
Scrutiny of Australian lenders and financial institutions has ramped up significantly since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings in the sector, forcing companies and regulators to take swift action.
The development follows criminal prosecution for alleged false and misleading representations against Bank of Queensland's unit ME Bank in May and a lawsuit against no. 2 lender Westpac in April.
The charges, filed https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-251mr-asic-brings-criminal-charges-against-cba-for-mis-selling-consumer-credit-insurance by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Thursday, relate to promotion and sale of certain policies as an add-on insurance product to 165 customers, CBA said in a statement.
""CBA apologises to customers who were affected by these issues and accepts that this conduct was unacceptable.""
The ASIC said earlier in the day that between 2011 and 2015, CBA had made false or misleading representations about benefits of the insurance policies to customers when some or all of the benefits were not available.

The bank said it had self-reported the issue to the ASIC in 2015 and compensated the affected customers, adding that it no longer sells the products in question.
Earlier this year, CBA was separately sued by regulators for alleged compliance failures in delivering financial services, charging wrong access fees, and overcharging interest.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 02:01AM ET</span>",Factbox-China crackdown wipes hundreds of billions off top companies' values,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regulatory crackdown has ensnared sectors from technology to education to property, wiping hundreds of billions off the market capitalisations of some of its largest companies and putting investors on alert over who may be next.
Here are some of the largest names that have been affected so far:
ALIBABA GROUP
The woes of China's biggest e-commerce company began in late 2020 when China abruptly suspended the record $37 billion stock market debut of its financial affiliate Ant Group and later fined  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) $2.75 billion for abusing its market dominance. 
The company's U.S.-listed shares have shed more than $400 billion in value since late October, when its founder Jack Ma made a speech that blasted China's regulatory system, which is widely regarded as the trigger for the government backlash that followed. 
Alibaba's sprawling empire of businesses has continued to face heat from regulators, over issues ranging from their use of algorithms, to consumer privacy and worker protections. 
TENCENT HOLDINGS
China's largest gaming and social media company has lost more than HK$2.7 trillion ($347.13 billion) in market value since its shares reached an all-time high in mid-February. 
The company has been fined for failing to report past deals to anti-trust regulators, its $5.3 billion plan to merge China's top two videogame streaming sites was blocked and it has been barred from entering music copyright agreements. 
Tencent has also been affected by China's latest efforts to combat gaming addiction among minors. In August under-18-year- olds were banned from playing video games for more than three hours a week.
DIDI GLOBAL
China's largest ride-hailing company became the target of a cybersecurity investigation by Chinese authorities days after its New York initial public offering in June, who ordered its app to be removed from Chinese app stores and barred it from registering new users. 
Its shares have lost about $37 billion, or more than 40%, of their value since it raised $4.4 billion from its June 30 IPO. 
The company has also been criticised by state media over how it pays its drivers. Reuters has reported that Didi is in talks with state-owned Westone Information Industry Inc to handle its data management and monitoring activities.
MEITUAN
The food delivery company became the target of an antitrust probe in April and experienced a sell off in its shares a month later after its founder and Chief Executive Wang Xing posted an ancient poem on social media that was perceived by some as criticising the government and President Xi Jinping.
Meituan, whose share have lost more than HK$1.2 trillion ($154.28 billion) in value since reaching their all time-high in February, has also been criticised on other matters, including treatment of its delivery riders and violation of consumer rights. 
NEW ORIENTAL EDUCATION & TECHNOLOGY GROUP
China's largest provider of private educational services has seen the market value of its U.S.-listed shares fall by $7.4 billion since July, when Beijing issued new rules barring for-profit tutoring on the school curriculum. 
Beijing wants to ease pressure on school children and reduce a cost burden on parents that has contributed to a drop in birth rates but analysts warn that the new rules threaten to decimate the country's private education sector. 

The company and its peers have been since trying to promote alternative classes such as drama and even parental training.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 01:56AM ET</span>",China Evergrande onshore bond trading suspended after downgrade,"By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co Ltd, applied on Thursday to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade, as the country's No.2 property developer wrestles with a liquidity crisis.
The application follows repeated trading freezes of the bonds in recent days by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges due to volatile trade.
With total liabilities of more than $300 billion, Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or a government bailout.
Suspension of trade in Hendga's onshore corporate bonds indicates an increasing likelihood of defaults and restructuring, market participants said. 
Hengda received notice on Sept. 15 from rating agency China Chengxin International (CCXI) that the bonds' ratings had been downgraded to A from AA, and that both the bonds' ratings and its issuer rating were put on a watch list for further downgrades, it said in a stock exchange filing.
Hengda applied to suspend trade of its onshore corporate bonds for one day, it said. On the resumption of trade on Sept. 17, its Shanghai and Shenzhen exchange-traded bonds will only be traded through negotiated transactions.
A bond trader, who declined to be identified, said that the changes in the trading mechanism were likely aimed at limiting participation and curbing volatility.
""Many companies would adjust the trading mechanism of their bonds ahead of default,"" he said.
The company's January 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond was last quoted at 24.99 yuan on Wednesday, and its Shanghai-traded May 2023 bond traded at 30 yuan. 
James Shi, distressed debt analyst at credit analytics provider Reorg, said that an Evergrande default has been largely priced into the market, and that a recovery ratio will likely be low in the case of an expected restructuring.
""The market is pretty certain Evergrande will default,"" Shi said. A very low recovery ratio would be due partly to deep losses at many of Evergrande's non-core businesses, making them hard to liquidate, he said.
A report by CreditSights this week said the probability of liquidation was low if Evergrande defaults.
A Shanghai-based vulture bond fund manager, who specialises in junk-rated bonds, said if Evergrande's bonds fell below 20 cents on the dollar, the valuation would be attractive for patient investors as a restructuring may take several years.
In the offshore market, Evergrande's 8.75% June 2025 dollar bond was trading at 29.375 cents on Thursday morning, up about 4 cents from lows on Wednesday, according to financial data provider Duration Finance.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a report that because Evergrande has dollar bonds issued by both the parent company and a special purpose vehicle, recoveries in a potential restructuring could differ between the two sets of bonds, and any potential restructuring process may be prolonged.
Worries over possible contagion from Evergrande's debt crisis have spilled over to other Chinese high-yield issuers. An index of Chinese high-yield dollar debt fell to 374.646 on Thursday morning, its lowest level since April 14, 2020. 

CCXI's downgrade of the developer was its second this month. A downgrade of Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Sept. 2 resulted in the bonds being made ineligible for pledged repo trading.
Rating agency S&P this week further downgraded Evergrande to ""CC"" from ""CCC"", with a negative outlook, citing reduced liquidity and default risks including the possibility of debt restructuring, while Fitch said an Evergrande default could expose numerous sectors to heightened credit risk.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>",Explainer-How China Evergrande's debt troubles pose a systemic risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group has raised fresh warnings of default risks, as it scrambles to raise funds to pay lenders and suppliers with regulators and financial markets worried that any crisis could ripple through China's banking system and trigger social unrest.
WHAT IS EVERGRANDE? 
Founded in 1996 by Chairman Hui Ka Yan in Guangzhou, Evergrande is China's second-largest property developer with $110 billion in sales last year.
The company listed in Hong Kong in 2009, helping it grow its asset size to $355 billion today. It has more than 1,300 developments across the nation, many in smaller cities. 
With sales growth slowing in recent years, Evergrande has branched into businesses such as electric cars, football, insurance and bottled water.
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT?
Investors became worried in September last year after a leaked letter purportedly from the company showed Evergrande had pleaded for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor listing plan. Evergrande said the letter was fake.
Concerns intensified after Evergrande admitted in June it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and news in July a Chinese court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm on the request of Guangfa Bank.
Evergrande's fast expansion has been fuelled by loans to support its land buying spree, and selling apartments quickly despite low margins so as to start the cycle again. 
Its total liability, which include payables, is at 1.97 trillion yuan ($306.3 billion), or around 2% of the country's GDP.
Other than the usual bank and bond channels, the developer has been criticised for tapping the shadow banking market, including trusts, wealth management products and commercial paper.
HOW HAS EVERGRANDE DELEVERAGED?
Evergrande accelerated its debt-reduction efforts last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios, dubbed the ""three red lines"" policy. It aims to meet all the requirements by the end of 2022. 
Evergrande has given buyers steep discounts for its residential developments and sold the bulk of its commercial properties. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale, raising $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit in Hong Kong, while its EV unit sold a $3.4 billion stake to new investors. 
On Tuesday, however, it said its asset and equity disposal plans have failed to make material progress.
WHAT'S THE RISK?
China's central bank highlighted in 2018 that companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risks to the nation's financial system. 
The leaked letter last year said Evergrande's liabilities involve more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated last week China Minsheng Bank has the highest exposure to Evergrande.
Late payments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions have exposure to Evergrande via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
In the dollar bond market, Evergrande accounts for 4% of Chinese real estate high-yields, according to DBS. Any defaults will also trigger sell-offs in the high-yield credit market.
A collapse of Evergrande will have a large impact on the job market. It has 200,000 staff and hires 3.8 million people every year for project developments. 
WHAT ABOUT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA?
Evergrande owns an office tower in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district. It also has one completed and two nearly-completed residential developments in the city, and a vast undeveloped land parcel.
Outside Greater China, Evergrande has spent billions of dollars acquiring stakes in foreign automobile technologies for its new energy vehicle business, including Swedish NEVS, Dutch e-Traction and British Protean. 
It also set up a separate JV with Germany's Hofer AG, automotive powertrain system developer, and supercar company Koenigsegg.
WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?

The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission warned Evergrande in August that it needed to reduce its debt risks.
Media reports said regulators have approved an Evergrande proposal to renegotiate payment deadlines with banks and other creditors. The Guangzhou government is also seeking opinions from Evergrande's major lenders about setting up a creditor committee.

Brazil's JBS in June announced an agreement to buy Rivalea from Singapore-listed QAF Ltd in a deal that would make it Australia's market leader in pork processing.
If the deal proceeds, JBS will have a significant presence in pig farming, export-accredited pig abattoirs, and related products through its Primo Smallgoods brand, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/jbs-proposed-acquisition-of-rivalea-raises-preliminary-competition-concerns?utm_source=twitter_accc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_tru_g_awa_c_mergers_jbs_rivalea.
""Our concern is not limited to JBS potentially denying access to processing facilities, it's also about the price and terms on which access would be provided,"" ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
The regulator also raised concerns that after the deal, JBS may raise the price of fresh pork or reduce the supply of pork to some producers from Rivalea's Diamond Valley Pork abattoir.
""The ACCC's preliminary view is that while JBS and Rivalea do not compete closely, the proposed acquisition may give rise to vertical integration concerns,"" Keogh added.

JBS, QAF and Rivalea did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

SEOUL (Reuters) -SK Innovation Co Ltd said on Thursday its shareholders had approved the company's proposal to separate its battery business into a new company. 
The decision paves the way for the battery business, a supplier for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Hyundai Motor Co and others to potentially raise funds and go public to finance its high-cost production capacity expansion. 
The unit, to be launched on Oct. 1, will initially be a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK Innovation, tentatively named ""SK Battery Co Ltd.""
More than 80% of SK Innovation shareholders voted in favour of the plan, SK Innovation said in a statement. 
""It's crucial to secure timely financial resources for further quantitative and qualitative expansions in the future,"" SK Innovation CEO Kim Jun told shareholders. 
""With the split-off of the battery business, we plan to evaluate various ways to secure resources, such as establishing joint ventures, partnerships and attracting strategic and financial investors."" 
Kim played down speculation the battery unit could go public as early as next year. He said the business, which is aiming to turn profitable in 2022, expects its financial performance to improve as its U.S. factories start operations. 
In July, Kim said he would review whether to list only on Nasdaq or opt for a dual listing in the United States and South Korea.
The South Korean battery maker said it had more than 1 terawatt hours (TWh) worth of batteries, which could power about 14 million electric vehicles.

South Korea's National Pension Service, SK Innovation's No.2 shareholder with an 8.05% stake, on Tuesday voted against the split-off plan, citing concerns about damage to shareholder value. 
Shares of SK Innovation were trading down 3.6% versus a 0.7% fall in the benchmark KOSPI as of 0251 GMT.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 11:20PM ET</span>",Air New Zealand studying how to add low-emissions planes to fleet,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd said on Thursday it was studying how it could use low-carbon technologies like electric, hybrid or hydrogen powered planes to dramatically reduce emissions from shorter and regional flights as soon as 2030.
The airline signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) to research the impact hydrogen planes would have on Air New Zealand's network, operations and infrastructure. 
Airbus said it is hoping to bring a hydrogen plane to market by 2035 - a goal some industry officials and analysts believe to be ambitious. 
This agreement brings us a step closer to ""seeing low carbon solutions in place for our shorter domestic and regional flights in the next decade,"" said Air New Zealand Chief Executive Greg Foran.
Airbus has already struck similar hydrogen study deals with easyJet (LON:EZJ) and SAS in Europe as airlines around the world look to meet ambitious emissions targets in line with government commitments. 
Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions.
The European manufacturer said the agreement with Air New Zealand would help it gather feedback on airlines' expectations and preferences for configuration and performance for zero-emissions planes. 
""We are also talking to several airlines on similar studies,"" said a Airbus spokesperson.
It is the latest environmental technology initiative for Air New Zealand, which in 2018 partnered with turboprop manufacturer ATR, part-owned by Airbus, to examine hybrid-electric regional aircraft.
Airbus last year unveiled three visual concepts for hyrdogen-powered planes and set itself a deadline of 2035 to put a carbon-free commercial aircraft in service, a target engine makers like  Safran  (PA:SAF) have described as ambitious. 

The European planemaker says radical technology is needed to help the industry meet climate goals, but U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is more cautious, saying sustainable liquid fuels will contribute most to efforts to decarbonise the aviation sector because of the infrastructure needed to support hydrogen.
Airbus in June told European Union officials that most airliners will rely on traditional jet engines until at least 2050, with zero-emission hydrogen planes primarily focused on regional and shorter-range aircraft from 2035.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Thursday morning, with investors digesting data from Japan and Australia. Tighter regulations for Macau's casino operators also triggered a global selloff.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.14% by 9:47 PM ET (1:47 AM GMT). Japanese trade data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 26.2% year-on-year and imports grew 44.7% year-on-year in August. The trade balance was at a deficit of JPY635.4 billion ($5.8 billion).
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.48%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.69%. Jobs data released earlier in the day showed that the employment change contracted by 146,300, while the full employment change contracted by 68,000, in August. The unemployment rate was 4.5%.
Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s GDP grew a better than expected 2.8% quarter-on-quarter and 17.4% year-on-year in the second quarter.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.84%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.44% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.61%, with Chinese stocks in the U.S. sliding for a sixth day. U.S. casino firms with ties to Macau saw their shares tumble as Macanese operators face tighter regulations.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 09:50PM ET</span>",Canadian Pacific clinches $27-billion Kansas City Southern deal as rival bows out,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd inked a $27.2 billion cash-and-stock deal to buy Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) on Wednesday after Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co conceded it could not save its own $29.6-billion deal for the U.S. railway.
The combination will create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico, with a network spanning 20,000 miles and approximately $8.7 billion of annual revenue. It marks the end of a high-stakes bidding war. 
The $300 per share cash-and-stock deal that  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) clinched is higher than the $275 per share cash-and-stock deal that it had secured in March to buy Kansas City Southern. That deal was scrapped when Canadian National wooed Kansas City Southern in May with a $325 per share cash-and-stock offer.
Kansas City Southern shares were little changed at $281.55 in Wednesday trading in New York. 
Canadian National suffered a blow when the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) rejected a temporary ""voting trust"" structure last month that would have allowed Kansas City Southern shareholders to receive the deal's consideration without having to wait for full regulatory approval.
Canadian Pacific has had its proposed voting trust cleared by the STB and so Kansas City Southern shareholders will receive the $300 per share in cash and stock even if the regulator shoots down the deal. The regulatory certainty this provided convinced Kansas City Southern's board to switch to a deal with Canadian Pacific, even though its offer was lower than Canadian National's.
Canadian National had also faced pressure from some of its investors, including hedge fund TCI Management Ltd, to abandon its pursuit of Kansas City Southern. Canadian National shares jumped 3.7% on Wednesday to C$150.97, as its investors expressed relief the attempted deal was abandoned. 
This is because a new offer would need to compensate Kansas City Southern for the regulatory risk of sticking with the Canadian National deal. This would have likely required a significantly higher price, as well a regulatory break-up fee that would be much higher than the $1 billion Canadian National offered previously.
The STB said last month that even though the overlap of Canadian National's and Kansas City Southern's networks was confined to 70 miles (113 km) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the two railways operated parallel lines in the central portion of the United States and could be under less pressure to compete if the voting trust for that deal was approved. 
""There have been significant changes to the U.S. regulatory landscape since Canadian National launched its initial proposal which have made completing any Class I merger much less certain, including an executive order focused on competition issued by President Biden in July,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. 
There is a silver lining for Canadian National. It is now entitled to a $700 million break-up fee from Kansas City Southern, in addition to the $700 million it paid the latter to pass on to Canadian Pacific as a break-up fee for terminating their March deal. Canadian Pacific had said it will cover both payments.
CANADIAN PACIFIC NOT IN THE CLEAR YET
There are still potential pitfalls for Canadian Pacific. While no major Canadian Pacific shareholder has come out against the Kansas City Southern deal, as happened with Canadian National, Canadian Pacific still needs a majority of its investors to vote for the new agreement.
It is also possible that the STB shoots down Canadian Pacific's deal for Kansas City Southern, even though it approved the voting trust for it. More likely, however, would be for the STB to require some concessions from Canadian Pacific, such as limited divestments or commitments on how much its charges customers, to clear the deal, people familiar with the matter said. It is possible that some of the concessions could erode Canadian Pacific's profitability. 

The STB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If the STB rejects the deal, Canadian Pacific's voting trust would have to divest Kansas City Southern. Canadian National could then attempt to buy it, though the U.S. railroad has also attracted acquisition interest in the past from private equity firms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Wednesday as rising crude prices boosted energy shares and a swath of positive U.S. data suggested inflation has crested and the economic recovery remains robust, boosting investor sentiment.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gathered strength as the session progressed, with economically sensitive cyclicals, smallcaps and transportation stocks leading the charge.
While value stocks initially held the advantage, the risk-on sentiment gained momentum through the afternoon, broadening to include growth stocks.
""Today is the first time in a while when both growth and value stocks are doing pretty well. It's been either or for much of the last few weeks and today it's both,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive of Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""Breadth matters, and that's something investors like to see.""
A host of economic data showed hints of waning inflation and an ongoing return to economic normalcy, even as supply constraints, complicated by hurricane Ida, hindered factory output.
Import prices posted their first monthly decline since October 2020, in the latest sign that the wave of price spikes has crested, further supporting the Federal Reserve's position that current inflationary pressures are transitory.
Next week, the Federal Open Markets Committee's two-day monetary policy meeting will be closely parsed for signals as to when the central bank will begin to taper its asset purchases.

Among the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but utilities gained ground. Energy was by far the biggest gainer, benefiting from a jump in crude prices driven by a drawdown in U.S. stocks.
U.S.-listed Chinese stocks extended recent losses, as weak retail sales data pointed to a possible economic slowdown in the mainland, while Beijing's regulatory overhaul of Macau's casino industry further dampened appetite for Chinese stocks.
This follows a series of regulatory moves by China against major technology firms, which has wiped out billions in market value this year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares of Macau casino operators on Wednesday shed as much as a third of their value, losing about $18 billion, as the government kicked off a regulatory overhaul that could see its officials supervising companies in the world's largest gambling hub.
With Macau's lucrative casino licences up for rebidding next year, the plan spooked a Hong Kong market already deep in the red after Beijing's regulatory crackdown on sectors from technology to education and property that sliced hundreds of billions of dollars off asset values https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-crackdown-wipes-hundreds-billions-off-top-companies-values-2021-09-13.
 Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF) led the plunge, falling as much as 34% to a record low, followed by a 28% tumble for Sands China (OTC:SCHYY). Peers MGM China (OTC:MCHVY), Galaxy Entertainment, SJM and Melco Entertainment all fell heavily, taking the drop to HK$143 billion ($18 billion).
U.S. casino companies also fell for the second straight day, losing as much as $4 billion in market capitalization on Wednesday, with  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp slumping to more than a year low, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International, dropping 8% and 5%, respectively.
The slump came after Lei Wai Nong, Macau's secretary for economy and finance, gave notice on Tuesday of a 45-day consultation period on the gambling industry to begin from the following day, pointing to deficiencies in industry supervision https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/macau-beefs-up-casino-rules-more-than-doubles-number-gaming-investigators-2021-06-21.
Beijing, increasingly wary of Macau's acute reliance on gambling, has not yet said how the licence rebidding process will be judged.
""Margins will be crushed at the gambling capital of the world and that will drag down all the big casinos,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.
Some Hong Kong stock analysts wasted little time in downgrading their view of near-term prospects for casino operators in the Chinese special administrative region, who must all rebid for licences when current permits expire in June 2022.
J.P. Morgan is downgrading to neutral or underweight all Macau gaming names from overweight, because of the tougher scrutiny on capital management and daily operations ahead of licence renewals, said analyst D.S. Kim. 
""We admit it's only a 'directional' signal, while the level of actual regulation or execution still remains a moot point,"" he said, adding the news would have already put doubt in investors' minds.
Brokerage CFRA downgraded Wynn Resorts to ""Strong Sell"" from ""Buy"", citing heightened regulatory risks and said the review was a major overhang for the company as well as other operators.
TIGHTER REGULATION
At a news briefing on Tuesday, Lei detailed nine areas for the consultation, such as the number of licenses, better regulation and employee welfare, as well as having government representatives to supervise daily casino operations.
The government also plans to increase voting shares in gaming concessionaires for permanent residents of Macau, as well as more rules on transfer and distribution of profits to shareholders.
Discussions over the future of Macau's casino licences come amid rocky U.S.-China relations, leaving some investors fearing an edge for domestic players over U.S.-based casino operators.
The government has not singled out any U.S. players, but companies have moved to beef up the presence of Chinese or local executives as they position themselves more as Macau operators than foreign one.
Before licence expiry, operators have tried to strengthen corporate responsibility and diversify into non-gaming offerings to placate Beijing, which fears over-reliance on gambling. 
Macau has boosted scrutiny of casinos in recent years, clamping down on illicit capital flows from mainland China and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.
Beijing has also stepped up a war on cross-border flows of funds for gambling, hitting the funding of Macau's junket operators and their VIP customers. 
In June, Macau more than doubled the number of gaming inspectors and restructured departments to boost supervision. 
George Choi, a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst in Hong Kong, said while the public consultation document gave few details, the suggested changes benefit long-term sustainable growth, with ""positive implications on the six casino operators"".
However, he cautioned, ""We will not be surprised if the market focuses only on the potentially negative implications, given the weak investor sentiment."" 

The consultation comes as Macau has struggled with a dearth of travellers because of coronavirus curbs since the start of 2020. While gambling revenues have picked up in recent months, they remain less than half of 2019 monthly figures.

The precaution would ""reduce potential damage to structures and nearby vehicles in the rare event of a potential fire,"" a company spokesman said in an email. GM sent a notice to consumers who had asked about parking issues, he added.
GM had previously asked owners to park Bolt vehicles outdoors, away from structures, and to not charge them overnight.
GM also urged owners to not leave Bolt EVs charging unattended, even if using a charging station in a parking deck. Bloomberg News reported the recommendation earlier.
GM in August widened its Bolt recall to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules, at a cost now estimated at $1.8 billion after reports of 10 fires. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from GM battery supplier LG.
Last week, the largest U.S. automaker said it would extend a shutdown of a Michigan assembly plant by two weeks in the aftermath of the Bolt battery issue recall.

GM said the extension of the production halt at its Orion Assembly plant that will go through at least Sept. 24 was ""a result of a battery pack shortage"" related to the recall.
GM will not resume Bolt production or sales until it is satisfied that the recall remedy will address the fire risk issue, it added.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",Britain's Sainsbury's makes it personal in price battle with rivals,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Sainsbury's will offer lower prices to customers using its digital loyalty scheme and self-scanner service, deepening ties with shoppers and cutting costs in the latest wave of innovation to hit the industry.
Dominated by Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and challenged by German discount groups Aldi and Lidl, Britain's supermaket sector has been marked by fierce competition and low margins for decades. 
Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest grocer, said the move to offer tailored digital discounts via its Nectar scheme was the most advanced for UK grocers, though it follows similar targeted initiatives by some U.S. and French food retailers.
It goes beyond the traditional loyalty model of customer spend translating to points that can be redeemed on products and is designed to encourage shoppers to use its SmartShop scanner service, either with handsets or on their smartphones, which ultimately will reduce the number of manned check-outs required in stores.
Sainsbury's said that from next Wednesday, Nectar app members shopping in stores will be able to access lower prices on a selection of up to ten branded and Sainsbury's own-brand products selected for them on a weekly basis. 
In comparison, Tesco's ""Clubcard Prices"" scheme offers lower prices to all Clubcard members on certain products, but the offers are not personalised. Smaller retailer the Co-Op offers discounts on fewer items based on spending habits. 
Mark Given, Sainsbury's chief marketing officer, told Reuters the price reductions - called ""My Nectar Prices"" - would be a minimum of 10% per product.
He said more value conscious customers would likely get regular discounts on vegetables, fruit, meat, fish and poultry - the key fresh food battleground with Aldi and Lidl that has forced the whole sector to cut prices.
More loyal Sainsbury's shoppers will get rewarded on things they usually buy and also offers on other products their data suggests they would be interested in.
""Advances in cloud computing and automation mean you can now process genuinely unique offers that are personalised to you with more real time data,"" Given said, adding his team had been working on the personalisation algorithms and engines for up to five years.
The ""My Nectar Prices"" offers will be additional to other loyalty points offers already available on the app.
GOING DIGITAL
Sainsbury's now has eight million customers registered with the Nectar digital app and CEO Simon Roberts is targeting 10 million by the end of next year.
The new offering should also encourage a greater uptake of the self-scanning SmartShop service, which has taken off during the COVID-19 pandemic as shoppers seek less human contact.
Sales were up 173% in the 2020-21 financial year and in supermarkets with handsets, 30% of all sales were through SmartShop, more than double the 2019-20 level of 14%.

Given said Sainsbury's would assess customer feedback before eventually rolling out ""My Nectar Prices"" to the online grocery channel.
Shares in Sainsbury's have risen 28% so far this year, buoyed by bid speculation on the back of the Morrisons takeover saga and signs Roberts' ""food first"" strategy is starting to work.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>","Analysis-China's biotech sector comes of age with big licensing deals, global ambitions","By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - If investors in China's biotech industry needed one more sign that the sector is coming of age, then a major licensing deal RemeGen Co Ltd struck last month with Seattle-based Seagen Inc fits the bill.
The agreement to co-develop cancer treatments using a RemeGen antibody drug conjugate is regarded as one of the biggest of its kind between a Chinese biotech and a Western firm. It provides for up to $2.4 billion in milestone payments, in addition to $200 million upfront as well as royalties if approved.
It is also at least the fifth out-licensing deal potentially worth more than $1 billion clinched by a Chinese biotech. Nearly all were signed in the past year, underscoring China's still small but growing role in developing innovative cancer drugs that will be used worldwide.
""China is clearly already an important and integral part of the global biopharma industry, not a separate ecosystem,"" said Franck Le Deu, senior partner at consultancy McKinsey in Hong Kong.
China's government has made cancer treatments a top priority for the industry. The world's most populous nation last year accounted for 30% of cancer deaths globally and 24% of newly diagnosed cases, according to one study.
Supportive policies for the sector over the past five years are also now bearing fruit and Western firms have come knocking at Chinese biotech doors.
For Seagen, the RemeGen deal will allow it to directly challenge breast cancer treatments from Roche Holding (OTC:RHHBY) and AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo. The antibody also shows promise in tackling bladder and stomach tumours.
Other notable deals include a Novartis AG agreement worth up to $2.2 billion for a  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd drug. The two are co-developing an antibody similar to Keytruda from Merck and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) which help the immune system attack several different types of cancer and which have reaped billions of dollars in sales.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has also partnered with I-Mab to co-develop a monoclonal antibody for several types of cancer in a deal worth up to $1.9 billion.
FLOURISHING ON FUNDING
Chinese biotechs have proliferated in a relatively short amount of time - a key catalyst being the return of overseas-trained Chinese scientists, dubbed ""sea turtles"", that began a decade ago and who have become increasingly attracted by domestic opportunities as the government pushes to develop the industry.
More recently, China in 2017 and 2018 aligned regulatory standards with international norms, rapidly speeding up the review system for new drugs. The sector also has seen a surge in funding after Hong Kong's stock exchange changed its rules in 2018 to allow listings of biotechs that have yet to earn revenue.
Success in the West is still fledgling - just three drugs developed in China which include BeiGene's Brukinsa for a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - have been approved by the U.S. FDA.
Investors are also concerned about frothy valuations and it remains unclear how many firms will succeed due to the lengthy process of drug discovery and the massive costs involved. That said, there appears to be more than enough funding to propel the industry. 
""We are looking at a turning point because of the capital supply and the regulatory approval regime,"" said Simone Song, founding partner of healthcare venture capital fund ORI Capital.
Nineteen Chinese biotechs made their trading debuts last year, mostly in Hong Kong, raising a combined $5.2 billion, up from 13 raising around $2 billion in 2019, Refinitiv data shows. So far this year, 20 have listed, raising $4.6 billion and the Hong Kong bourse has flagged nearly 30 more in the pipeline.
According to McKinsey's Le Deu, the combined market value of Chinese biotechs listed in Hong Kong, on Shanghai's STAR board and on the Nasdaq was some $180 billion as of May, which compares to just $1 billion in 2016.
GLOBAL AMBITIONS
The number of large out-licensing pacts for Chinese biotechs is only set to grow, industry experts say.
I-Mab, Innovent Biologics, Junshi Biosciences and Legend Biotech are likely candidates for further licensing deals with Western firms, said Morningstar analyst Jay Lee, citing their existing partnerships and pipeline assets.
I-Mab says it is seeking strategic partners to help develop and commercialise its products, while Legend said it is open to collaboration. Junshi and Innovent did not respond to requests for comment.
Legend was in 2017 one of the first Chinese biotechs to win an out-licensing deal with a major Western pharmaceutical firm. Its CAR-T bone marrow cancer drug co-developed with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is set to be reviewed by the FDA in November.
Though few in number, the more established Chinese biotechs have even bigger ambitions.
BeiGene, which is 20.5% owned by  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and valued at $34 billion, out-licenses some products but built its own U.S. and European sales teams for Brukinsa. It has also announced it will build a new R&D and manufacturing centre in New Jersey.
""We are really trying to brand ourselves as a global company...we just happen to have labs right now in China,"" said Angus Grant, BeiGene's chief business executive.

Hutchmed, the first Chinese company to have an in-house innovative cancer drug unconditionally approved in China, is not planning to partner in the United States or at home now that it has grown, said Chief Executive Christian Hogg.
""We have got around $1.2 billion in cash on our balance sheets, we have got the capabilities, resources, financial and organisational resources to pretty much do whatever we want to do outside of China,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) on Wednesday forecast that within four years, about half its revenue will come from software and other recurring sales, but its chief financial officer told Reuters high chip prices in its hardware business will keep pressuring overall profits. 
Cisco is the biggest maker of networking gear for data centers and corporate campuses, but it is shifting toward selling recurring subscriptions for software such as its WebEx collaboration service and cybersecurity services. 
At an event with Wall Street analysts, Cisco said it believes the portion of its revenue coming from subscriptions will rise from 44% notched for its fiscal 2021 ended July 31 to 50% by fiscal 2025. 
The company gave a fiscal 2025 revenue forecast with a midpoint of $62.9 billion, saying it expects a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. Cisco predicted the same growth rate for adjusted profits, targeting a midpoint of $4.07 per share in fiscal 2025.
Cisco shares closed down 0.5% at $57.56 after the event. Piper Sandler analyst James Fish told Reuters that Cisco's outlook implies that profit margins will stay flat, but Wall Street was hoping for margin growth from Cisco's shift to software.
Cisco Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said the company's software units do have higher margins than its hardware business, but some subscription revenue will also come from services that have lower margins than software. 

But Herren said a global shortage of parts such as computing chips, memory chips and even power supplies will pressure gross margins in the company's hardware business, which Cisco also forecasts will keep growing.
""The component shortages that everyone's dealing with right now have led to price increases, and those price increases are going to be with us for quite some time,"" Herren told Reuters in an interview. ""We're a (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co) customer, and they did an across the board price increase the range anywhere from 8% to 20%. We are subject to that.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global shares edged higher on Wednesday on the strength of U.S. equities markets that were boosted by rising oil prices and positive economic data out of the United States.
U.S. factory production data showed that manufacturing was strong in August despite a slowdown due to closures related to severe storms and the ongoing microchip shortage. 
Earlier in the day U.S. import prices for August declined for the first time in 10 months. That followed Tuesday data from the U.S. Labor Department showing that inflation cooled last month and may have peaked.
U.S. oil rose by more than $2 on Wednesday after stockpiles fell last week to their lowest since September 2019. 
The MSCI All Country World Index gained 0.26%, and all three of the major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. 
However, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.80% after U.K. data showed that inflation hit a more than nine-year high last month.
Investors are awaiting the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy meeting next week for what the Fed will announce regarding its bond-buying program and when it will begin tapering. 
""Risk markets in Europe and America are trading in a subdued fashion ahead of next week's FOMC meeting, with economic data failing to boost conviction in the reflation trade at the moment,"" ANZ analysts wrote. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 236.82 points, or 0.68%, the S&P 500 gained 37.65 points, or 0.85%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 123.77 points, or 0.82%.
Possible increases to the U.S. corporate tax rate remain important in the background, and one bank estimated that raising the corporate tax to 25% could shave 5% off S&P500 earnings in 2022.
""We still have a very fragile market, especially if we get some type of tapering from the Federal Reserve,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. ""Any material change to tax policy can create a more volatile market.""
Data out of China showed that factory and retail output and sales growth hit one-year lows in August, as fresh COVID-19 outbreaks and supply disruptions pointed to a possible economic slowdown on the mainland.
The dollar was last down 0.122% mainly due to a sharp slide in USD/JPY's, which broke below important supports as safe-haven buying bolstered the yen in particular.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A southern California company that sells beer, wine and bottled water targeting female customers has been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors out of millions of dollars.
In a complaint filed on Tuesday, the SEC said SHE Beverage Co raised over $15 million from more than 2,000 investors in unregistered stock sales from 2017 to 2019 by falsely touting its business plans and promoting its successes.
The SEC said the Lancaster, California-based company overstated revenue, spent only 2% of investor proceeds on beverage inventory instead of the promised 30% and made bogus claims it had received takeover bids as high as $500 million.
It also said Chief Executive Lupe Rose, Chief Financial Officer Sonja Shelby and Chief Operations Officer Katherine Dirden misappropriated at least $7.5 million from investors, including $1.2 million spent at casinos and other sums to buy cars, trucks and luxury goods and make lease payments on a home.
""We have reviewed the complaint and we look forward to correcting the record and proving that the allegations are inaccurate in open court,"" Jonathan Bletzacker, a lawyer for the company and the executives, said in an email on Wednesday.
The SEC said SHE was incorporated in 2015, six years after co-founders Rose, 52, and Shelby, 58, both of Palmdale, California, began working on its concept.
SHE's website describes the company as ""celebrity driven,"" with water products designed to serve a ""health cautious"" audience.

The IPO comes at a time when athletic gear, especially shoes, has been flying off the shelves at most retailers as COVID-19-led gym closures push people to take up running to keep themselves fit.
The company sold 31.1 million shares in its initial public offering (IPO) priced at $24, well above its $20 to $22 target price range, raising $746.4 million. Its stock opened at $35.40.
On was founded in 2010 by running enthusiasts Olivier Bernhard, David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti, with Federer investing an undisclosed sum in the company in 2019.
The 20-times Grand Slam winner teamed up with the company earlier this year to develop the Roger Pro tennis shoe.
On also makes a 100% recyclable brand of running shoes, called Cyclon, made from castor beans. The shoes are available only on a subscription basis and have to be returned to the company for new ones once they wear out.
The company's listing comes at a time when there is growing global demand and investor interest for sustainable products.
Other sustainability-focused startups that recently went public include Hollywood star Jessica Alba's Honest Co and Oprah Winfrey-backed Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB. 
Wool footwear maker Allbirds also filed for an IPO last month.
In April, Reuters had reported the shoemaker was targeting a listing in autumn https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/federer-backed-shoe-firm-running-targets-autumn-ipo-sources-2021-05-28 that could fetch it a valuation of between $4 billion and $6 billion.

On's existing shareholders also offered a little more than 5 million shares in the IPO, and the company will not get any of those proceeds.
Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>","Billionaire hedge fund managers Cohen, Dalio tout cryptocurrencies","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investors Steven Cohen and Ray Dalio have joined the cryptocurrency craze by putting cash to work and saying at a conference this week that bitcoin and other digital currencies are an interesting way to diversify their holdings.
Dalio, who founded the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, told attendees at the SALT conference in New York on Wednesday, ""I have more crypto than gold."" 
Cohen, who runs Point72 Asset Management, said earlier this week at the conference that he hopes not to miss out on opportunities presented by the digital currencies.
SkyBridge, the alternative investment firm whose founder, Anthony Scaramucci is hosting the SALT conference, has a 12% investment in bitcoin, the firm's co-chief investment officer, Ray Nolte, said at the event. 
Even as investment firms seek to create funds for cryptocurrencies that feel and look like stock and bond funds, they are known for being volatile and potentially risky. Bitcoin, for example, traded over $48,000 on Wednesday, after dipping below $30,000 in July. In April it topped $60,000. 
Dalio said cryptocurrencies represent diversification and noted that portfolios need to be spread across more asset classes. ""Diversification is a good thing,"" he said.
Cohen meanwhile has been studying cryptocurrencies for himself and potentially his firm for some time and told investors in May that he would be ""remiss"" to ignore the $2 trillion cryptocurrency market.
This week, Cohen announced he was investing in Radkl, a digital asset investment and proprietary trading firm, and he told the conference that his firm, Point72, is building crypto-trading capabilities.
Cryptocurrencies were a major theme at the SALT conference, which was held in person in New York this year after last year's event in Las Vegas was cancelled due to the pandemic.
The Cohen and Dalio appearances were among the event's best-attended sessions, with fund managers and investors eager to hear how billionaires viewed topics ranging from China relations to working remotely versus in the office. 

Dalio said China could be viewed as an existential threat to the United States, adding it is imperative to have more contact there, not less, to gain a better understanding of how the government operates.
Cohen, in turn, said flexibility is key in a post-pandemic world. ""I like working from home and I don't have to be in the office five days a week,"" he said. ""I think we have to be flexible.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday, as a red-hot rally in energy stocks paved the way for the broader market to end its streak of daily losses.
The S&P 500 rose 0.9% to snap a six-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 236 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.8%.
Energy rallied more than 3% as data showing a larger-than-expected draw in weekly U.S. crude inventories eased investor fears about the virus impact on energy demand.
Crude oil inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 3.5 million barrels.
The sharp jump in oil prices comes just days after OPEC+ increased production by 400,000 barrels per day.
 Cabot Oil & Gas  (NYSE:COG), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) were among the top gainers in energy, with the latter up ending the day up more than 8%.
Megacap tech stocks shrugged off their early-day malaise to end mostly higher, despite rising Treasury yields, the enemy of growth stocks. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were higher. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) proved an exception to the broader market climb.  
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the standout performer, up more than 1%, after hiking its dividend and announcing the $60 billion stock buyback program.
Casino stocks were on the backfoot on reports China is looking to strengthen regulatory oversight in the Asian gambling mecca of Macau.
Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) slumped 14%, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) fell 6%, and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) was down about 2%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), meanwhile, released more data on so-called breakthrough cases of Covid-19, which it said supported the need for another round of the vaccinations. 
On the economic front, investors digested mixed economic data as manufacturing activity fell short of expectations, while industrial production was in-line with economists forecasts.
“Demand is very high for a variety of goods in short supply, but manufacturers cannot keep up with demand due to a shortage of materials,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The move higher in the broader market comes as investors eye progress on President Joe Biden’s infrastructure spending plan.
Biden is expected to meet with holdout Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema at the White House on Wednesday. Both Manchin and Senema favor trimming the proposed $3.5 trillion budget plan."

But despite the Biden administration’s plans to reopen the economy entirely, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and decelerating vaccination rates could lead to a continuation of remote lifestyles for the foreseeable future. Therefore, Wall Street analysts expect lesser-known software stocks Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX), Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI), and iHuman Inc. (IH) to rally in price in the near term. So, let’s examine these names.The demand for software products and services to facilitate a remote lifestyle has accelerated since last year. And, despite the Biden administration’s efforts to bring the country back to its pre-pandemic economic level this year, progress on the vaccination front, or a lack thereof, remains a concern. 
The United States vaccination rate is the lowest among the seven prosperous democracies, with just 61.94% of its population fully vaccinated, according to a University of Oxford study. This, coupled with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, suggests a continuation of remote lifestyle for the foreseeable future. Perhaps tellingly, established multinationals such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others, have postponed their office reopening plans.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>","Vivendi paves way for Lagardere takeover, adding to media empire","By Sarah White and Gwénaëlle Barzic
PARIS (Reuters) -Vivendi said on Wednesday it was set to purchase another stake in Paris Match magazine owner Lagardere, paving the way for a full takeover which would extend the influence of its controlling shareholder, Vincent Bollore, over France's media landscape.
Canal+ owner Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) , which already has 27% of Lagardere, said it had agreed to buy Amber Capital's 17.9% holding, for 24.10 euros per share or around 610 million euros ($720.3 million). 
It said it would later launch a full bid for Lagardere at the same price, once it has passed the 30% threshold requiring companies in France to make a takeover offer. That would value Lagardere at around 3.4 billion euros, compared to its 2.7 billion euros market capitalisation at Wednesday's close. 
If successful, the acquisition of Lagardere will mark the end of what was once one of France's national industrial champions, which under its late founder used to have large stakes in companies like plane maker Airbus.
Heir and Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere has sold off parts of the conglomerate bit by bit. Last year he brought in investors like Vivendi and luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault when he was trying to fend off an activist campaign by Amber. 
As well as travel retail operations and a publishing business, which includes the Hachette label, it still has influential media assets which Bollore and Arnault have lusted after, sources close to the matter have said previously. 
These include Paris Match, the Journal du Dimanche weekly newspaper and Europe 1 radio station, which has already built bridges with Bollore's CNews TV channel, a network that has been topping ratings since taking a conservative turn. 
Bollore's media intentions in France have ruffled feathers in President Emmanuel Macron's inner circle, sources have said, with some fearing his empire building could result in airwaves inundated in more right-wing views ahead of a 2022 presidential election.
The billionaire is also set to cash in as Vivendi prepares to list and spin-off Universal Music Group in September, raising questions about how he might use the money.
ANTITRUST
The Amber stake sale could take months to close and requires regulatory authorisations first, including from the European Union, but Vivendi said it would launch an offer at the same price once it had clinched the 45%. It is aiming for December 2022 at the latest. 
Any subsequent takeover would also have to overcome potential antitrust problems in other areas, as Vivendi also has a publishing business, Editis.
But many of Lagardere's shareholder would likely be ready to sell out, including the Qatar Investment Authority, which has 11.5%, people familiar with the matter have said. 
LVMH boss Arnault, initially caught in a tug-of-war over Lagardere, has largely withdrawn from the battle. He now has an 11% stake in Lagardere and has cut financial ties with the firm's heir and chief executive, Arnaud Lagardere, after initially investing in his holding company. 
Lagardere said in a statement it was ""delighted with the investment project that Vivendi wishes to carry out."" 
Amber Capital had waged an activist campaign against Lagardere, largely succeeding in the governance overhaul it had sought after the firm this year scrapped an arcane partnership structure that served as a buttress to takeovers. 
Lagardere's offices in Paris were raided as part of a judicial investigation on Wednesday, in connection to the company's previous disputes with shareholders such as Amber.

A source familiar with Vivendi's management said the firm would continue to back Arnaud Lagardere as Lagardere's CEO, and had informed him in advance of the move with Amber.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - ""The Morning Show,"" the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ series that tackled the #MeToo movement via the lens of a fictional newscast in its first season, returns this week and explores topics from racism and homophobia to addiction and cancel culture.
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the show's creators to rework the story for the second season, which begins streaming this Friday. The emergence of the coronavirus became a major subject, alongside other real-world concerns. 
Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, ""The Morning Show"" looks at the lives of people who work on a New York-based newscast and are shaken by a male anchor's sexual misconduct and executives' cover-up of bad behavior.
The new episodes pick up immediately after anchors Bradley (Witherspoon) and Alex (Aniston) exposed the network's misdeeds on live television. 
Now a reluctant feminist hero, Alex takes a break to reflect and try to make peace with her actions, Aniston said in an interview. But she struggles to regroup.
""I'm not as unhinged as Alex in any way, shape or form,"" Aniston said of her on-screen persona. ""But I've met many an Alex along the way in my life, and I remember seeing them and thinking 'don't ever let me ever become that.'"" 
Alex analyzes her relationship with Mitch (Steve Carell), her former co-host who resigned after mistreating women and is weighing whether he can rebuild his life. 
Aniston said the show's writers scripted nuanced conversations about sensitive issues and whether anyone can return from being ""canceled"" by a scandal. 
""They really address the gray area,"" Aniston said. ""They allow the characters to say the things that are said behind closed doors that they wouldn't dare ever say out loud. And I think it leads to really good conversations.""
Bradley finds herself leading the morning newscast, but ratings are on the decline and she is working to find her true identity. 
""She doesn't know where she fits,"" Witherspoon said. ""Does work define her? Does her upbringing define her? I think it's pretty cool to have a 40-year-old woman being on this journey of self discovery."" 
The actress has publicly advocated for equal treatment of women and had served on an advisory board for Time's Up, the group founded to fight sexual harassment in the workplace.
Time's Up's CEO and members of its board of directors recently resigned amid controversy over the group's ties to politicians and corporations. The advisory board was disbanded. 

Witherspoon said she was ""really encouraged"" that the steps would make way for new leadership that can ""continue to grow and strengthen the organization.""
""The most important thing is Time's Up has an incredible mission at its center, to really create equity and disrupt systems that created discrimination and harassment,"" she said. ""It's imperative that it continues because women are still faced with these issues every single day.""

Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid EV battery manufacturers Microvast (MVST), Romeo Power (RMO), and Flux Power (FLUX), which look overvalued at their current price levels. Let’s discuss.The demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has been increasing, with the governments globally taking measures to transition their nations to zero-emission transportation. As a result, the demand for EV batteries has also been growing rapidly. According to an Emergen Research report, the global EV battery market is expected to reach $46.80 billion by 2027.
However, EV production continues to be hamstrung by the global semiconductor chip shortage, making the EV battery industry’s near-term growth prospects bleak.

(Reuters) -U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists said on Wednesday that booster doses of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine may not be needed, even though the third shot generates a higher immune response in recipients.
The FDA staff members said in a document prepared for outside advisors that it is still unproven that the efficacy of Comirnaty - the COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) - is declining. 
""Some observational studies have suggested declining efficacy of Comirnaty over time against symptomatic infection or against the Delta variant, while others have not,"" they said in the document. 
""However, overall, data indicate that currently U.S.-licensed or authorized COVID-19 vaccines still afford protection against severe COVID-19 disease and death in the United States.""
The FDA staff did say the booster dose met pre-specified conditions the regulator had set to show that the shot was generating an immune response.
However, they said in the document that licensure for the boosters should also consider ability to prevent hospitalization and death, as well as the dynamics of the pandemic in the United States. 
The agency released the document on Wednesday for consideration by a committee of outside experts who will meet on Friday to decided whether to recommend if U.S regulators should approve the extra round of shots. 
The FDA staff view reflects that of many scientists who have questioned whether the boosters are necessary broadly, even as President Joe Biden has pushed for the additional shots in the face of surging hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
Biden set a Sept. 20 target to begin administering 100 million booster shots in the United States.
After the FDA meets, a panel of advisors to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to meet next week to make its recommendation, according to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.
PFIZER ARGUES BOOSTER APPROVAL
Pfizer, in a document it prepared for the meeting, argued that U.S. regulators should approve a booster shot of its vaccine for use six months after the second dose due to waning effectiveness over time.
Pfizer said data from its own clinical trials showed that the vaccine's efficacy diminished by around 6% every two months after the second dose. It also said the incidence of breakthrough COVID-19 cases in that trial was higher among people who received their shots earlier.
The company also pointed to real world data from Israel and the United States showing declining effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
The U.S drugmaker said in a roughly 300-participant clinical trial, the third dose generated a better immune response than the second. It also pointed to data from the booster program recently started in Israel to show that a third dose restores high levels of protection from the virus. 
Earlier this week, two top FDA vaccine scientists were among the authors of an article https://www.reuters.com/world/us/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-not-widely-needed-top-fda-who-scientists-say-2021-09-13 saying they do not believe the current data supports giving the shots. One of those scientists - Marion Gruber, director of the FDA's Office of Vaccines Research and Review - will be speaking at Friday's meeting.

Some U.S. officials are hoping boosters https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-09-15/analysis-us-looks-to-covid-19-boosters-to-curb-virus-spread might prevent mild cases and reduce transmission of the virus as well as reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, which could hasten America's recovery. 
Some countries have already begun COVID-19 booster campaigns. The United States authorized extra shots for people with vulnerable immune systems last month.

Moscow has been searching for additional proceeds for the state budget and has been concerned about rising costs of defence and state construction projects amid high global inflation and increasing prices for metals.
It imposed temporary export taxes on Russian steel, nickel, aluminium and copper, which will cost their producers $2.3 billion from August to December 2021, and is preparing a permanent mechanism to ""accumulate part of the profits from these superfavourable market conditions.""
The metals and fertiliser producers met finance ministry and other officials on Wednesday to discuss the ministry's proposals, which so far have been focused on pegging a mineral extraction tax (MET) levied on the producers to the global price of their products.
""The finance ministry still seems to tend towards raising the MET on a 'fair' basis - a flexible rate that takes revenue and the global prices into account,"" said a source who attended the meeting, adding that no calculations were disclosed as of yet.
""The business proposed leaving the MET as it is and basing a 'fair' tax system on profits or free cash flow,"" he added.
Ideas from both sides, according to four other sources, who were present at the meeting or briefed about its results, include a higher MET tax, a higher profit tax and linking the profit tax to the size of dividends and investment.
""It seems that the government representatives have listened to us carefully. Whether they have heard us will be revealed in the near future. But the fact that the dialogue has finally taken place is certainly a positive development,"" steel producer Severstal said in a statement. 

The final decision will be taken by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin after the finance ministry supplies its proposals to him this week, one of the sources said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The regulator overseeing housing giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) proposed on Wednesday changes to recently imposed capital and leverage requirements on the pair.
The proposed rule from the Federal Housing Finance Agency would encourage the pair to shift more risk from taxpayers to private investors, while allowing them to support the housing market, the agency said.
“The proposed requirements provide the Enterprises with the necessary incentives to support sustainable lending initiatives by transferring a significant amount of credit risk away from the taxpayers to private investors that are better positioned to take this risk,” said FHFA acting director Sandra L. Thompson in a statement. 
The proposal makes several changes to a capital rule first imposed on Fannie and Freddie in November. That rule envisioned Fannie and Freddie would have to raise billions of dollars in capital and leverage cushions, as part of the regulator's bid to prepare them to exit from government conservatorship.

Among the changes, the rule would change the leverage buffer from a fixed ratio to one that would shift alongside the amount of capital the enterprises are required to hold. It also would reduce the amount of capital the pair must hold after transferring credit risk on loans to a private party.
Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee over half of the nation's mortgages, have operated under government control since a 2008 bailout amid the subprime mortgage crisis.

CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) -Britain's Channel 4 will be able to access more money to compete with streaming giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) if it comes under private ownership, a minister said on Wednesday.
Britain's government said in June https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-government-plans-sale-broadcaster-channel-4-2021-06-22 it was planning to sell the publicly owned but commercially funded broadcaster, launched nearly 39 years ago as an edgy alternative to the BBC and  ITV  (LON:ITV).
""If Channel 4 wants to grow then at some point soon it will need cash. Without it, Channel 4 won't have the money to invest in technology and programming, and it won't be able to compete with the streaming giants,"" junior minister John Whittingdale told the Royal Television Society's Convention.
A consultation on the plan, which has been publicly criticised by Channel 4 itself, closed on Tuesday. Its chief executive Alex Mahon said there was no evidence to show that a privatised Channel 4 would be able to better fulfill its remit.
""There's no data and there's no evidence as yet that Channel 4 would have been more able to sustain that mission, (...) its delivery of social impact, its support of indies and the creative community in 10 years time if it was in private hands,"" Mahon said at the convention.
The consultation on privatising Channel 4 was launched by Oliver Dowden before he was replaced as culture minister by Nadine Dorries on Wednesday. His speech to the convention was delivered remotely by Whittingdale.
Channel 4, which broadcast the AIDs drama ""It's a Sin"" this year, has a remit to provide challenging and distinctive programming for audiences under-served by other broadcasters.
Rather than making programmes, it commissions them from production companies, helping sustain Britain's successful independent TV sector.
Channel 4 said this month that research by Ernst & Young showed that removing its unique publisher-broadcaster model could result in a 2 billion pound ($2.76 billion) reduction in its contribution to the creative economy over 10 years.
Whittingdale said its public service remit would remain.

""So if we do choose to proceed with a sale, I will make sure it remains subject to proper public service obligations,"" he said, adding that this would cover a commitment to commissioning programming from independents.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",California Bay area regulators probe Phillips 66 refinery work -email,"By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) - California Bay Area regulators are investigating whether Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) failed to obtain necessary permits to produce renewable fuels at its oil refinery in Rodeo, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.
The refiner is undergoing a multi-step conversion of the plant to turn it into the world's largest producer of renewable fuels using feedstocks such as soybean oil and animal fats. California is the biggest gasoline market in the United States, but some of the state's 14 refineries are not always profitable. Several are looking to survive long term by cashing in on state incentives for production of lower-carbon fuels. 
Phillips 66 started to process small volumes of soybean oil at the Rodeo refinery in the first quarter of 2021, the company said this year. 
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), which regulates stationary sources of air pollution in the region, is investigating whether the company modified its refinery without getting required additional permits, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.
Phillips 66 wants the Rodeo project to produce more than 800 million gallons of renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and sustainable jet fuel annually. That effort requires increased use of hydrogen, which can cause flaring events and refineries to malfunction, environmental groups say.
At least 10 groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, have complained to regulators about the additional emissions produced by using more hydrogen to treat feedstocks like soybean oil and animal tallow.
The NRDC, in a July letter, argued that Phillips 66 did not request proper approval from the air quality management district to start processing that oil this year. 
The management district, in its email this month to NRDC, said it will conduct an on-site investigation and engineering review of the Rodeo facility, the email said. 
Phillips 66 told Reuters it obtained the necessary permits to produce renewable diesel from an existing hydrotreater as part of a standalone flexibility project. The management district declined to comment.
REFINERS IN TRANSITION
The renewable diesel market is small but growing quickly. The U.S. Energy Department projects it will be about 7% of the overall diesel pool by 2030. Refiners see it as an opportunity to shift to lower-carbon fuels even as electric vehicles become more popular.
Unlike refining petroleum products, producing those fuels requires additional hydrogen to remove oxygen from fats and oils used for making renewable fuels. Groups including the NRDC, the Sunflower Alliance and the Rodeo Citizens Association told regulators they are concerned air emissions at the facility will increase because of this process.
Phillips 66 said it does not need to increase Rodeo's capacity to generate hydrogen, and said estimated emissions from hydrogen generation will be part of Contra Costa County's independent Environmental Impact Report, which is not yet complete.
“We are confident the analysis in the EIR will demonstrate the project stands to significantly reduce emissions from the facility,” Phillips 66 said in a statement.
Environmental groups say the facility will need to add more hydrogen generation capacity than what is permitted, particularly if the refiner uses soybean oil.

Hydrogen-related reactions caused seven flaring events at the Rodeo and the nearby Marathon owned Martinez refineries in the last five years, causing the units’ hydrotreaters, hydrocrackers and other units to malfunction, according to reports filed by the refiners with regulators.

The framework agreement, seen by Reuters, comes shortly after news that a group of Canadian workers are seeking to unionize as Amazon continues to manage discontent among some workers at its warehouses.
The world's largest online retailer has long discouraged staff from organising and staved off a high-profile attempt to form a union in the United States this year. 
But globally, it continues to face challenges such as warehouse closures that unions in France pushed for during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In a protocol signed on Wednesday, Amazon Italia agreed to consult with trade unions on issues like new openings, job training and industrial relations with authorities.
""An important agreement ... and recognition of the role of the unions, marking something new, at a world level, in relations with the e-commerce giant,"" said the head of the CGIL union Maurizio Landini.
Earlier this year Amazon workers in Italy staged a strike over demands on delivery drivers in the pandemic in the first such action by Amazon's logistics operation in the country.
That protest came after a surge in Amazon's e-commerce business triggered by the health emergency.
Amazon, which has invested more than 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in Italy in the last 10 years and created 12,500 full-time jobs, said the agreement was proof of its commitment to engaging with unions.

The current global semiconductor shortage has impacted most industries, and the autonomous vehicles (AV) industry is no exception. However, governments worldwide have been implementing favorable policies to support the semiconductor industry, and companies have been ramping up production to meet the growing demand for chips.
AV-related technologies are far from being fully developed, but when they are they are expected to reduce crash injuries significantly. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for contactless self-driving technologies. According to a Precedence Research report, the global AV market is expected to grow at a 63.2% CAGR between 2021 - 2028. This should significantly increase the demand for semiconductors.

Rivian, which counts Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and T. Rowe Price among its investors, registered the IPO confidentially with U.S. regulators last month. It is seeking a valuation of about $80 billion in the listing, which is expected to land in late October or November, the sources said.
Rivian declined to comment.
If Rivian raises $8 billion in the IPO, that would rank as the fourth biggest of the past decade in the United States. Only three other companies have raised more than $8 billion in IPOs since 2011, according to Dealogic:  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which raised a world-record $25 billion in 2014; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which raised $16 billion in 2012; and Uber (NYSE:UBER), which raised $8.1 billion in 2019. 
Proceeds from the IPO will allow Rivian to expand production beyond its assembly plant in Normal, Illinois. The startup has said it is in talks with multiple locations to build a second U.S. factory, which documents viewed by Reuters show would include an investment of at least $5 billion. 
Rivian has not provided details on its IPO plans, but it is expected to reveal its finances for the first time in a public filing in the coming weeks. 
California-based Rivian is among the most well-funded U.S. startups, having raised $10.5 billion since the start of 2019. Other investors include BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Soros Fund Management, Fidelity and Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ).
While Rivian has been dubbed as the ""Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) killer"" in some quarters, it is still tiny compared with Tesla Inc, which boasts of a market cap of nearly $740 billion and plans to build a pickup truck that would compete with Rivian's own version, the R1T. 

Rivian's flotation is expected to round out another record year for U.S. IPOs. Companies have raised more than $230 billion so far this year through share sales, according to data from Dealogic, and are on track to raise tens of billions more before the year ends. 
Founded as Mainstream Motors in 2009 by Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe, the company changed its name to Rivian in 2011. “Rivian” is derived from ""Indian River"" in Florida, a place Scaringe frequented in a rowboat as a youth.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) invested 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in the Western Balkans in 2020 and will match that amount this year, Pierre Heilbronn, an EBRD vice president, said on Wednesday.
Heilbronn told Reuters 2020 was an unusual year because of the COVID-19 pandemic which prompted the bank to invest in its earlier agreed projects as well as to support policy changes in the six Western Balkan countries that it helps.
Over nearly three decades, the bank has supported Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia - which are all hoping to join the European Union - to adjust their economies to meet EU standards.
Though investment in infrastructure remains a priority, the bank has become increasingly involved in helping the region, which is dependent on coal-produced energy, to transition towards green energy, Heilbronn said.
But he warned public money would not be enough and that private investors should also be mobilised.
""One of objectives of my visit here is very much trying to push this (green) agenda,"" Heilbronn, in Sarajevo on a farewell visit, said in an interview.
He said small-and-medium-sized companies (SMS) were a key engine of regional growth but privatisation of state-owned enterprises has lagged, and that Bosnia was ""probably the most extreme case"".
""Connectivity, green and competitiveness are the three overarching priorities for us,"" Heilbronn said. ""Making progress in how state-owned enterprises are run would open up interest of foreign investors"" who have been largely absent from the region.

As for Chinese investment in the region, mainly in infrastructure and energy, Heilbronn said the EBRD was concerned when investment did not meet sustainability criteria, and did not create jobs locally.

The U.S. aerospace manufacturer, which raised its full-year profit forecast in July on the back of higher demand for its commercial engines, spare parts and aftermarket services, said it continues to see the trend despite concerns from the Delta variant.
The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company expects full recovery in its commercial aero unit in 2024 and expects President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate will strengthen the outlook heading into the fourth quarter.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>","DoorDash sues New York City over customer data law, second lawsuit in week","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -DoorDash Inc sued New York City on Wednesday over a new law requiring food delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants, saying it violates customer privacy and lets restaurants compete unfairly.
The lawsuit is the latest battle in a series of legal clashes between food delivery app companies and cities.
It was filed in federal court in Manhattan six days after DoorDash, Grubhub Inc and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats sued the United States' most populous city over a separate law capping fees that delivery companies charge restaurants.
""The law puts consumers first,"" Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's law department, said in an email. ""It puts them in control of their information when they place orders through these apps.""
New York City has tried since the coronavirus pandemic began to help restaurants that had complained about food delivery app fees as high as 30%, but which became more dependent on delivery as dining rooms closed or limited capacity.
About 90,000 restaurants nationwide have closed temporarily or permanently during the pandemic, costing 1.5 million jobs, the National Restaurant Association said in June.
In Wednesday's lawsuit, San Francisco-based DoorDash said the city exhibited ""naked animus"" by requiring food delivery app companies to provide customers' names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses to restaurants.
DoorDash said this would let restaurants ""free-ride"" on data they would not demand from in-person diners, in a ""shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers' privacy.""
It also said ""more vulnerable populations, especially undocumented customers"" could be harmed if data were mishandled, and shared with immigration authorities or hate groups.
Soon after the pandemic began, New York City imposed temporary 5% and 15% fee caps on food delivery apps, which the companies hoped would end as restaurants resumed more normal operations.
The caps cost DoorDash, Grubhub and Uber Eats hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue through July, the companies said.

DoorDash and Grubhub sued San Francisco in July over fee caps there. Chicago sued those companies last month, saying their deceptive practices misled customers and hurt restaurants. DoorDash and Grubhub rejected Chicago's claims.
The case is DoorDash Inc v City of New York, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-07695.

The announcement comes just days after two U.S. Senate Democrats unveiled a proposal to tax corporate stock buybacks to help fund President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion investment plan.
The senators said the ""Stock Buyback Accountability Act"" would encourage large corporations to invest in their workers rather than enriching investors and executives by boosting stock prices.
Democrat lawmakers have also proposed a substantial roll-back of tax cuts implemented by Donald Trump's administration, including raising the top tax rate on corporations to 26.5% from the current 21%. 
Microsoft shares have soared about 35% this year, making it the second most valuable company in the world with market capitalization of $2.25 trillion. 
The buyback plan, which has no end date and can be terminated at any time, follows similar announcements by other U.S. tech giants.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said earlier this year they were returning $90 billion and $50 billion to their shareholders, respectively, and have ramped up their plans since the corporate tax cuts in 2017. 

""They have to be opportunistic... being well hedged given the ambiguity of the future of tax legislation,"" said Doug Ciocca at Kavar Capital Partners, which owns Microsoft shares.
Microsoft has benefited from an accelerated shift to cloud computing and demand for laptops during the pandemic and has accumulated $130 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It announced it last repurchase program of $40 billion in 2019.

Investing.com – DoorDash stock (NYSE:DASH) rose 2.3% Wednesday after it sued New York City over a law that requires food delivery companies to share more customer data with restaurants on their platforms.
DoorDash called the requirement “a shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers’ privacy.” The company has argued that the law imposes no limits on what restaurants can do with the data, nor does it have provisions for protecting it.
The law will enable restaurants to use its trade secrets to compete with it, the company is arguing.
New York City approved a series of bills over summer that toughens the playing field for DoorDash, the largest food delivery app by market share in the U.S. and its rivals like Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) and Grubhub-parent Just Eat Takeaway (NASDAQ:GRUB). 
Another law the New York City passed permanently caps the commissions the apps can charge restaurants for their services. The three companies sued the city last week in this matter. DoorDash and Grubhub are suing San Francisco over a similar rule.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 11:37AM ET</span>","Flagship Wall St conference sees record attendance, run on steak","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A flagship Wall Street conference returned this week, attracting so many fund managers and investors who were hungry for in-person interactions that organizers ran out of a steak and lobster entree and seats at its first lunch on Monday.
    The three-day SALT event, long one of the hedge fund industry's biggest conferences, took a break during the pandemic last year but its host, Anthony Scaramucci, was determined to bring it back this year with strict safety protocols, a different kind of agenda and much closer to home for many.
    The roughly 2,300 people who came in person needed to show proof of vaccination and the venue changed to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, from the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.
Initially, guests roamed the spacious hallways wearing masks, bumping elbows and leaving distance between seats in the cavernous conference rooms. But within a few hours early nervousness had melted away and there were handshakes and hugs aplenty between longtime business associates, many of whom had not seen each other in over 18 months. The lunch area was so crowded on the first two days that there was a mad race for seats and boxed lunches had to be served to those standing at the back of the room.
    ""In New York, people have more of a game face on,"" Scaramucci told Reuters in an interview. ""There isn't the kind of frivolity that we have in Vegas.""
    He joked that more people were sitting in the darkened conference rooms actually listening to presenters than in Las Vegas, where they might be playing slots.
    Many of the prominent investors who had appeared in the past were back, including Steven A. Cohen, Daniel Loeb, Marc Lasry, Mike Novogratz and Ray Dalio. Sports legends Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine also appeared, as did media personality Paris Hilton.
    But there was a heavier focus on cryptocurrency investments, which have soared in popularity, as well as how the pandemic has changed society in investable ways than the human interest elements that made the Vegas destination popular. There was plenty of talk about how funds survived enormous volatility during COVID-19, how they are handling back-to-work arrangements - hedge fund manager Cohen says he likes working from home and doesn't have to be in the office five days a week - and what may happen with inflation.
    ""It was great to see people again and to have so many conversations,"" said Milind Sharma, chief investment officer at QuantZ Capital. ""That alone was worth the price I paid to come.""
   In addition to the 2,300 people who showed up in person, 700 signed up to view the program remotely, making it the best attended conference ever, SALT organizers said. 
    Many attendees who spoke to Reuters said they were given tickets for free rather than pay the entry fee, which totaled $8,000 a ticket for some.
    Scaramucci launched the SALT event in 2009 when he ran hedge fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital. He left in 2017 to become communications director for former President Donald Trump for just 11 days, eventually returning to SkyBridge. At the conference he joked that his firing might have been the best thing that happened to him, saving his career, his firm and his marriage.
    The pandemic, which has so far killed 4.8 million people globally, prevented Scaramucci from organizing SALT in its usual three-day in-person format last year. Although the Delta variant sparked concerns about the New York event and even some talk of postponing it, it appears to have gone off without a hitch.

    As for SALT's future, Scaramucci wasn't ruling anything out, including a return to the Vegas strip.
    ""You have to come up the risk curve in order to get back to normal,"" he said.

Attributing it to multiple sources, Gamesradar said there is talk that a delay of Battlefield 2042 will be announced soon.
VentureBeat’s Jeff Grubb tweeted, “Welcome to delay season. More delays coming this week. I'll add that I'm actually referring to a singular delay.""




@Dealer_Gaming joined in the conversation with his tweet: “Battlefield 2042 delayed to 2022. That’s what I’m hearing”.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing more than $10 trillion on Wednesday published an ambitious blueprint for energy companies seeking to tackle climate change, including sharp cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and a winding down of oil and gas production.
The unprecedented initiative - dubbed the Net Zero Standard for Oil and Gas - details 10 required standards to help money managers compare companies' strategies and understand whether they are aligned with United Nations-backed efforts to reduce global carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.
Oil and gas companies such as BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) have published targets and strategies aimed at battling climate change, but the huge variation in scope, definitions and ambition makes analysis and comparison exceedingly difficult for investors.
At the same time, pressure has grown on portfolio managers and banks to ensure that their investments chime with the 2015 Paris accords to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 
With the next round of global climate talks taking place in November, concern is growing that too many plans are flaky and unlikely to provide material help by reducing absolute emissions at the rate needed to limit global warming.
""We need to have a level playing field now on disclosure because it's not possible to compare and contrast across the sector,"" said Adam Matthews, who is head of responsible investment at the Church of England Pensions Board and chaired the investor-company process to develop the new initiative.
Other investors to back the plan include Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, along with Britain's Legal & General Investment Management, HSBC Global Asset Management and France-based Caisse des Depots among others.
Given the fossil fuel industry is responsible for the lion's share of global emissions, the investor group said it is introducing a minimum set of standards to ensure that energy companies' plans are ""credible"".
NET ZERO TARGETS
Among these is a requirement to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, meeting emissions-reduction targets along the way while aligning capital expenditure and production plans with the net zero target. 
The standards also demand commitments to disclose and independently verify strategies.
Shell, Italian company Eni and Norway's Equinor have all set targets to become net zero emissions by 2050, meaning that any emissions they produce will be offset by carbon capture technologies or other solutions, such as reforestation.
Other companies, including BP and TotalEnergies, aim to reduce emissions from part of their operations to net zero by 2025. 
The investor group behind the new plan acknowledges that winding down oil and gas production ""can be a very legitimate strategy"", Matthews said.
Although it has not set a deadline for companies to adhere to the standards, investors are willing to vote against transition plans and the appointment of certain directors if they feel company boards are not doing enough, Matthews said. 
The new standard will be piloted by leading energy companies including BP, Shell, Eni, Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and TotalEnergies ahead of wider adoption by the sector, the investor group said.
Shell said in a statement that it was pleased to take part in the pilot and that ""establishing a standard approach that allows investors to fairly assess companies' progress would be a valuable development.""
This group said its plan had been developed by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change with support from the Transition Pathway Initiative and in consultation with Climate Action 100+, non-governmental organisations with specific expertise in the sector as well as oil and gas companies themselves.

Erste Group board member Thomas Schaufler will take over Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s retail banking division, while Joerg Oliveri del Castillo-Schulz, currently an independent consultant, will become chief operating officer.
Germany's No. 2 lender is trying to turn over a new leaf under new Chief Executive Manfred Knof. It is carrying out a 2 billion euro ($2.36 billion) restructuring that also involves hundreds of branch closures.
Schaufler assumes the retail responsibilities of Sabine Schmittroth, who will continue to oversee human resources.
Oliveri del Castillo-Schulz takes over the COO job from Joerg Hessenmueller, who was also responsible for technology. 
Hessenmueller will resign, Commerzbank said. 
That move comes after the bank in July abandoned a project to outsource securities settlement to HSBC and, as a result, wrote off 200 million euros in the second quarter.
The German lender's supervisory board agreed on the moves at a meeting on Wednesday.

Commerzbank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, is expected to post a loss for the full year, according to analysts.

Gol said the new agreement builds on a previous codeshare arrangement between the two companies, and will increase options for Gol travelers on South American and North American routes.
American Airlines' investment in Gol is expected to happen via a sale of 22.2 million recently issued preferred shares by the Brazilian airline, taking the U.S. firm's stake in Gol to 5.2%.
""We believe it will further strengthen Gol's presence on international markets, accelerate our long-term growth and maximize value for our shareholders,"" Gol Chief Executive Officer Paulo Kakinoff said.

Analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a market report that they welcome the additional liquidity provided by American Airlines' investment in Gol, as it should further enhance the Brazilian company's financial flexibility, even though they remain cautious with the airline industry in Latin America.
""Today's announcement represents a further evolution in the American-Gol partnership, in our view, rather than anything revolutionary,"" J.P. Morgan said, adding that American's right to appoint one member to Gol's board may imply a desire by the U.S. company to exert as much influence as possible.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>","Volvo Cars gears up for $20 billion IPO in coming weeks, sources say","By Helena Soderpalm, Arno Schuetze and Abhinav Ramnarayan
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - China's Geely Holding is in advanced discussions with banks to list its Volvo Cars unit in the coming weeks, three sources told Reuters, in what is expected to be one of Europe's biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) this year.
Volvo Cars is aiming for a valuation of about $20 billion in the planned Stockholm listing, the sources said, with one saying the launch was pencilled in for the end of September.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and SEB are leading the transaction, while other banks including BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Carnegie and HSBC are also involved in the deal, the sources added.
Volvo Cars declined to comment. Geely did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside normal business hours in China. SEB and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The other banks were not immediately available.
Geely, which bought Volvo from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-chinese-tycoon-driving-volvo-plans-tackle-tesla-2021-09-02 more than a decade ago in the biggest acquisition by a Chinese firm of a foreign car maker, sought to float shares in the Swedish firm in 2018 but then pulled the deal citing trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
Traditional carmakers have fallen out of favour in recent years, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has risen to be one of the world's most valuable companies, putting the focus on electric vehicles.
Many European firms have pivoted toward the electric sector, including Volvo Cars which aims to only make fully electric cars by 2030 and owns a 49.5% stake in electric car maker Polestar.
VALUATION
Gothenburg-based Volvo Cars aims to secure a valuation of roughly $20 billion, one of the sources said, while another mentioned a possible range of $20 billion to $30 billion.
A third source suggested a $16 billion valuation was more realistic, citing the firm's revenue outlook.
A $20 billion valuation for Volvo would be equivalent to six to seven times its earnings, a level some analysts say is high although it would put it in line with rivals Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW. Tesla's valuation is more than 70 times.
NordLB's automotive analyst Frank Schwope estimated a valuation range of $10 billion to $15 billion.
""The strong margins seen in the first half of 2021 are unlikely sustainable as the market benefited from a strong post-pandemic rebound that is unlikely to continue,"" Schwope said.
For Geely's founder Li Shufu, who bought Volvo for $1.8 billion, the listing is a milestone on the road to transport of the future, where cars are part of an electrified network of mobility services generating data and business opportunities.
A slew of startups have tapped into the investor frenzy for electric vehicles this year. Rivian, which rolled its first electric pickup truck off the production line this week, will seek a valuation https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/amazon-backed-rivian-seeking-70-80-billion-valuation-ipo-source-2021-08-27 of about $70 billion to $80 billion when it goes public at the end of this year, sources have told Reuters. 
Nordea Chief Investment Officer John Hernander said the bank was interested in buying Volvo shares if a big enough chunk of the company was sold to keep liquidity high.

""That is key. We and many others have been really disappointed in the low liquidity in Traton,"" he said, drawing parallels to the 2019 IPO of the truck unit, in which owner Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) floated 11.5% of the shares.
Volvo warned this month that sales volumes in the second half of 2021 could fall year on year after it had been forced to cut production due to material shortages.

However, RRC’s natural gas production decreased in the second quarter. Also, its expenses increased considerably, and it reported a loss.

For example, it is alleged that RRC artificially decreased its periodically reported cost estimates to plug and abandon its wells. So, the company’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd. fell as much as 10.5% after an 11% decline on Tuesday. That is the biggest two-day drop for the stock since March 2020.  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp. dropped as much as 6.2%. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) Ltd. slumped 11%, while MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International fell as much as 3.9%. 
Wednesday’s selloff started in Asia, where Macau’s top gaming stocks listed in Hong Kong lost a record $18.4 billion in combined market. Officials said changes to casino regulations would include appointing government representatives to “supervise” companies in the world’s biggest gaming hub.
“It’s another concerning action of increasing regulation aimed at some of the higher growth parts of the economy,” said Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments. “It will probably make investors even more hesitant to expand investments in China.”
A Bloomberg Intelligence index tracking big Asia peers fell 23% earlier.  Officials in the enclave -- the only place in China where gambling is legal -- announced that they would begin a 45-day public consultation period to discuss legal revisions.

Investing.com – Canadian National stock (NYSE:CNI) rose 4.3% Wednesday as it bowed out of the race to acquire Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
The decision paves the way for  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) to acquire the U.S. railroad company. Kansas City traded 1.1% higher while Canadian Pacific rose 1.4%.
Canadian National is entitled to a $700-million break-up fee from the U.S. railroad, in addition to the $700 million it paid Kansas City to pass on to Canadian Pacific as a break-up fee for terminating their March deal.
“. . .There have been significant changes to the U.S. regulatory landscape since CN launched its initial proposal which have made completing any Class I merger much less certain, including an executive order focused on competition issued by President Biden in July,” Canadian National said in a note.
In measures announced in July, the Biden administration tightened rules to promote competition and discourage antitrust practices in industries. This included telecom, airlines, railroad and several other sectors.  
The bidding for Kansas City started in April when Canadian Pacific first offered to buy the company, valuing it at $25 billion. Canadian National made it a contest with its $33.7 billion cash-and-stock offer that Kansas City then accepted.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Wednesday, struggling to make any real headway after falling in the previous session amid fears for the strength of the U.S. and global economies.
Weaker-than-expected economic data for August out of China, where growth in both retail sales growth and industrial production slowed sharply, continued to weigh on sentiment, offsetting any relief at the sight of Democratic lawmakers watering down some of their tax hike plans. Industrial production in the U.S. also slowed in August, but only to a still-respectable 0.4% on the month.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15 points, or less than 0.1%, at 34,563 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both flat.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock stood out from the generally lackluster backdrop, rising 1.4% after the software giant announced a new $60 billion buyback program and raised its quarterly dividend by 11%.
Wynn Resorts stock (NASDAQ:WYNN) fell sharply for a second straight day, down 8.1% on concerns that new regulations of casinos in Macau - which accounts for over one-third of Wynn's revenue - will stunt its business in China.  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) stock, which also has significant exposure to Macau, fell another 3.6%. 
Higher oil and natural gas prices supported stocks in the sector, with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rising 2.8% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rising 1.8%. An acute squeeze in European energy markets, coupled with ongoing tightness in Asian LNG markets, has lifted Henry Hub gas prices to their highest since 2009. Shale gas specialist  Chesapeake Energy  (NASDAQ:CHK) stock surged 5.1% to a fresh record high since it emerged from bankruptcy.
Also rising was  Canadian National Railway  (NYSE:CNI) stock, which jumped 3.6% after the rallroad operator formally withdrew its bid for U.S. rival Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU). The move makes the takeover of KCS by  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) all but a formality.
Elsewhere, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock fell 3.0% with some investors apparently switching funds out to invest in the IPO of rival coffee chain  Dutch Bros  (NYSE:BROS), which priced its initial public offering at $23 a share on Tuesday. The IPO elicited comparisons on valuation that are not necessarily in Starbucks' favor, given Dutch Bros' faster growth.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 09:31AM ET</span>","Analysis - U.S. hopes COVID vaccine boosters will decrease not just deaths, but virus spread","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. officials preparing to roll out COVID-19 booster shots in the face of waning vaccine protection and surging hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant are hoping boosters might prevent mild cases as well.
In theory, that could reduce virus transmission - a goal officials have been less explicit about - and hasten America's recovery.
“It is not the primary reason (for boosters), but it could actually be a very positive offshoot,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the Biden Administration's COVID-19 advisers and the nation’s top infectious disease doctor told Reuters.
The main reason for boosters, Fauci said in a telephone interview, is to reverse the trend of rising ""breakthrough"" infections among people who are fully vaccinated, a point that many experts dispute. 
Available data has shown that most severe breakthrough cases have occurred in people over 65 or among those who are immunocompromised. That latter group is already recommended for a third dose. 
Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who is overseeing the U.S.-government backed COVID-19 vaccine trials, is a proponent of using booster doses to bolster antibody levels enough to prevent infection.
    ""If you don't get infected, you're not going to transmit it to others, and we will more effectively abort the epidemic, and that has economic benefits,"" Corey said.
The problem there, many experts point out, is that there is scant scientific evidence showing that boosters will in fact prevent infections and transmission.
Some government studies have shown that when infected with the Delta variant, fully vaccinated people can transmit the virus, mostly to unvaccinated people.
""If you take a look at the evidence from the United States, it is very clear that protection against infection and mildly to moderately symptomatic disease is diminishing,"" Fauci said. 
It is happening among many of the U.S. study populations – including a recent study https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-19-vaccines-hold-strong-against-delta-protection-waning-older-adults-2021-09-10 of 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states and large cities. “Not dramatically, but enough,"" he said.
'WHAT'S THE GOAL?'
While some 63% of eligible people in the United States are fully vaccinated, the Delta variant has caused a surge in the deadly disease among the unvaccinated.
The two most widely used vaccines in the United States – those based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc – are highly effective but less so against Delta. Cases are rising among the vaccinated - including some that result in hospitalization and death.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will release data on a possible booster shot on Wednesday morning ahead of a Friday meeting of its vaccine advisory panel. It will include a briefing on the impact of boosters in Israel https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-present-covid-19-booster-shot-data-fda-experts-2021-09-05, where the government has closely tracked recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.
During weekly White House COVID-19 briefings, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients and Fauci have expressed concern that waning immunity against mild, symptomatic COVID-19 could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death, pointing to data from Israel.
Other countries that have started or are planning booster programs, including Israel - and in the U.K. for people over 50 - have been more frank about the goal to reduce transmission.
Debate over booster doses in the United States has become a sore point for virologists, who largely remain unconvinced that the vaccines are losing their ability to prevent severe disease and hospitalization.
This week, an article in the journal Lancet by two departing FDA vaccine experts and senior scientists at the World Health Organization, challenged the rationale for booster doses https://www.reuters.com/world/us/covid-19-vaccine-boosters-not-widely-needed-top-fda-who-scientists-say-2021-09-13, saying more evidence is needed to justify their widespread use and that most cases of COVID-19 are spread by the unvaccinated.
Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA' vaccine advisory panel, is unconvinced by arguments that boosters are needed just yet.
“The question is, what's the goal? If the goal of the third dose is to enhance protection against serious illness, there's no evidence that that's a problem,"" Offit said. If the goal is to increase levels of neutralizing antibodies with the aim of decreasing asymptomatic or mild cases, “then we should see those data.” 
    Corey said the bar for proving a vaccine prevents disease transmission is high.
""Is there proof today? No, but there is every reason to believe that this is possible, and may be beneficial,"" he said.
    Fauci, however, said Israeli data shows that since the booster campaign started, the country has started seeing a decline in the virus’ reproduction number, which represents how many other people a person will COVID-19 is likely to infect. The more immunity in a population, the lower the reproduction number.

Fauci said he is confounded by arguments from vaccine experts that boosters are only needed when vaccines stop preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death.
“What is the magic, mystical issue about hospitalization? I don’t understand that,"" he said. ""What we’re really saying is we don’t care about anything except keeping people out of the hospital. Really? You’re kidding.”

Atlanta-based GreenSky, which went public in 2018 at a valuation of about $4 billion, has provided home improvement loans to about 4 million customers since being founded in 2006.
Digital businesses that bring in new customers or unique technologies have become more attractive, with the pandemic boosting the importance to online activity, while the role of bank branches diminishes.
The deal implies a price of $12.11 for each GreenSky share, representing a 56% premium to the company's closing price on Tuesday. 
Its purchase will further bulk up Goldman's consumer banking unit Marcus, named after one of the bank's founders and a key plank of Chief Executive David Solomon's plan to reduce Goldman's reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. 
""We have been clear in our aspiration for Marcus to become the consumer banking platform of the future, and the acquisition of GreenSky advances this goal,"" Solomon said in a statement.
Solomon has aimed to build businesses with predictable revenues such as consumer banking and mass-market wealth management, which most of Goldman Sach's main rivals now have.
Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-goldman-eyes-deals-boost-marcus-sources-2021-01-15 earlier this year that Goldman was considering acquisitions to build out Marcus after the Wall Street firm reported slow loan and deposit growth at the business last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

GreenSky connects banks with customers seeking financing via an app.
The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies and includes a tax adjustment of $446 million, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021 or first quarter next year.

Investing.com – Citrix stock (NASDAQ:CTXS) traded 5.4% higher in Wednesday’s premarket on a Bloomberg report that the Cloud-services provider is again exploring a sale.
The company had last attempted a similar exercise in 2017 before calling it off over valuations. The latest exercise comes after hedge fund Elliott recently disclosed a stake of more than 10% in the company.
Citrix plans to gauge the interest of potential buyers over the next few weeks, according to the Bloomberg report. A final decision hasn’t been made yet and Citrix right remain a standalone entity, the report said.
The company’s stock price has suffered, lagging the S&P 500 S&P 500. It has fallen almost 19% in a year while the Nasdaq 100 Nasdaq 100 index has gained 36%. 
Elliott is known to chase companies to take steps to increase shareholder returns. This includes moves like reshuffling top management, forcing buybacks, and demands for better capital allocation.
Citrix offers Cloud-computing services that include enabling users to access desktops from remote locations. While those capabilities were in big demand during the pandemic and will continue to be in the work-from-home paradigm, the company has taken time to transition to a subscription model.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's financial watchdog set itself targets on Wednesday to help consumers by 2025 cut their losses from a growing number of scams and steer clear of investment products that are too risky.
Financial fraud has rocketed during the pandemic as more consumers search on the internet for products, with 1.15 million new accounts opened by just four trading app firms in the first four months of 2021.
The collapse of investment firm London Capital & Finance has also forced the government to pay millions of pounds in compensation to investors.
The growth of scams has required the Financial Conduct Authority to become more assertive in protecting consumers, who lost nearly 570 million pounds ($790 million) to investment fraud in the financial year that ended in April. That sum has tripled since 2018.
""We want to see a consumer investment market in which consumers can invest with confidence, understanding the risks they are taking and the regulatory protections provided,"" the FCA said in a statement.
The watchdog said that by 2025 it would cut by a fifth the number of consumers missing out on investment earnings, halve the number of consumers investing in unsuitably risky products, and cut the money lost to investment scams carried out by regulated firms.
To achieve these goals, the watchdog said it would explore changes in rules to make it easier for firms to provide more help to consumers who want to invest in relatively straightforward products.
It will also launch a new 11 million pound investment harm campaign, and be more assertive and agile in how it ""detects, disrupts and takes action against scammers"".
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is funded by an annual levy on industry. It has risen sharply over recent years to 833 million pounds, and the FCA said it would review rules to stabilise the bill for covering failed firms.
But PIMFA, which represents financial advisers, said the FCA's proposals for addressing ""unsustainable"" rises in FSCS levies do not go far enough.
""The FCA needs to be significantly more ambitious in setting out a supervisory approach in which harm is identified and acted on quicker,"" PIMFA CEO Liz Field said.
But Simon Turner, a financial services partner at consultants EY, said reducing harm in the market long term will involve significant supervisory and enforcement activity in the short to medium term, which is likely to increase the costs of compensation.

The FCA said it will also implement plans to toughen up a ""duty of care"" on financial firms towards their customers, seen as a step change in protection.

The IPO involves a capital increase of about 350 million euros ($416 million) through the issuance of new shares as well as a limited sale of around 200 million euros worth of existing shares by the company's co-founders.
Antin said the company would be worth between 3.5-4.1 billion euros after the IPO.
Its IPO comes after rival private equity firm Bridgepoint went public in July in a deal that saw its value rise by more than a fifth on its London stock market debut. 
Antin's IPO offer is due to start on Sept 15, and shares are expected to start trading on Sept 24.
A bookrunner for the offering said books were covered with indicated demand exceeding the full deal size.
The deal will help Antin, one of the world's leading infrastructure investment firms with approximately 20 billion euros in assets under management, to accelerate growth and diversify its investment portfolio while also strengthening its brand.
Antin said on Sept. 3 that it expected 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to reach about 92 million euros and an EBITDA margin of about 60%, excluding IPO transaction costs.
It expected net income of around 60 million euros after approximately 16 million of pre-tax non-recurring IPO transaction costs.

Other buyout funds including L Catterton - the private equity firm backed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault and luxury goods empire Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy - are also considering tapping public markets. They are planning to do so at a time when private equity buyouts have hit record volumes with activity rising 152% in the first six months of the year to $512 billion, representing 18% of global M&A volumes.
J.P. Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Europe are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities Europe and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are acting as joint bookrunners.

MADRID (Reuters) -Fashion brand Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) has outpaced Swedish rival H&M in its efforts to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis, with second-quarter sales rising above pre-pandemic levels.
The world's biggest fashion retailer's sales in the quarter edged above levels seen before the pandemic as most stores reopened and people rushed to renew their wardrobe after store closures imposed to curb the spread of the virus.
Rival H&M's sales grew less than expected from a year ago in the three months through August, and remained lodged below pre-pandemic levels. H&M said lockdowns and restrictions hampered its development, particularly in Asia. 
Inditex Executive Chairman Pablo Isla said that sales in stores and online were progressively recovering across all brands and markets, despite some restrictions in Asia due to the pandemic.
""We have had a strong start in the autumn winter season,"" he told a conference call. ""Inditex competitive differentiation is bigger than ever.""
Analysts said consumers have shifted their spending recently to focus on fashion workwear as big cities slowly return to normality and most lockdowns are lifted, a trend which is benefiting the Inditex brands, which include Zara and Massimo Dutti. 
The Spanish company's second-quarter net profit of 850 million euros was higher than the 214 million euros ($181.14 million) booked in the same period in 2020 and 4% higher than the profit in 2019.
Inditex said sales accelerated in the May-July period to 6.99 billion euros, 7% higher than in the same period in 2019, as shoppers started buying clothes again for summer social events.
The sales during the second quarter were in line with the 7.02 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Inditex said shop and online sales at constant exchange rates between August and the first week of September were 22% higher than a year ago and 9% higher than in the same period of 2019. 
Although fashion retailers are recovering from the pandemic, the spread of the Delta variant means some restrictions have been reintroduced, while many industries, including fashion, face supply problems due to a shipping container shortage and other bottlenecks.
NEW PARIS STORE
Shares in H&M, which reports fuller quarterly figures at the end of the month, traded 3.3% lower at 0940 GMT, while Inditex slipped 1.6%. 
During the pandemic, Inditex strengthened its digital retail platform and shut its smaller outlets worldwide in favour of expanding flagship stores able to function as mini distribution hubs. 
Inditex said 99% of all of its stores have reopened and is currently operating 6,654 stores worldwide compared with 7,337 stores a year ago. 
Chairman Isla said one of its biggest Zara stores will open in Paris by October and its Uterque brand will integrate into Massimo Dutti stores by next year, under a digital transformation strategy that he said was being accelerated.
Inditex online sales rose 36% in the first half compared with the same period in 2020, when restrictions on mobility in key markets including Britain, Germany and France forced shoppers to buy from home.

The company expects online sales to exceed 25% of total sales this year and it will launch a men's sports collection under the name Zara Athleticz at the end of September.

Investing.com – Hennes & Mauritz stock (ST:HMb) traded 3% lower Wednesday in Stockholm as lockdowns in various markets kept its June-August sales below pre-pandemic levels.
Third-quarter net sales might have risen 9% on-year to 55.58 billion crowns (around $6.57 billion) but were still 11% shy of the 2019 period’s 62.57 billion crowns. The impact of lockdown restrictions was felt more in Asia, the company said. Starting from India in April, markets in Asia were hit badly by the surging delta variant, which forced governments to bring back restrictions on physical stores. As a result, factories and stores were mostly shut during May-June and even later.  
H&M has lagged Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) in recovering from the pandemic. The market leader today reported a 7% rise in constant currency in May-July sales compared to the same period in 2019.
H&M started the quarter with 180 of its stores closed and ended the period with around 100 of them still temporarily shut. Most of its markets still have restrictions resulting in reduced footfall, it said.
The Swedish company said sales in store have picked up in many markets while online sales have continued to increase. Excluding Asia and Oceania, sales in local currencies were back at the same level as before the pandemic.
The company said the numbers are provisional and the final print will be released on September 30.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Norwegian telecom firm Telenor is selling its Myanmar operations to avoid European Union sanctions after ""continued pressure"" from Myanmar's military junta to activate intercept surveillance technology, the company's Asia head told Reuters.
Telenor announced in July it would sell its Myanmar unit to Lebanese investment firm M1 Group for $105 million, prompting an outcry from activists in the country who have been relying on its services for communications.
A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-myanmars-military-moved-telecoms-sector-spy-citizens-2021-05-18/?fbclid=IwAR3aulnAJ4kejAnvf80rWhJHzmaFQxrBs5qKDivQzbL-4TNJfI62siFD6K0 in May found telecom and internet service providers in Myanmar had been secretly ordered in the months before the junta's Feb. 1 coup to install invasive technology that would allow the army to freely eavesdrop on the communications of citizens.
""Since the military took over, it's been clear for us that our presence will require Telenor Myanmar to activate intercept equipment and technology for the use of Myanmar authorities,"" Asia head Jørgen Rostrup said in an interview. 
Allowing the activation of the intercept technology would break the 2018 EU arms embargo against the Southeast Asian country, the executive added, stressing the need for legal or regulatory safeguards in Myanmar to protect human rights.
""Telenor Myanmar has not activated the equipment as of yet and will not do so voluntarily,"" he said. He declined to comment on whether the intercept technology had been installed at Telenor's operations in Myanmar.
Rostrup's comments represent the first time Telenor has addressed the impact of the intercept on its strategy since the junta seized power.
A spokesman for the Myanmar military did not answer calls for comment. Norway's industry ministry declined to comment, saying the sale of the unit was a decision for Telenor's board and management to make.
Many governments allow for what are commonly called 'lawful intercepts' to be used by law enforcement agencies to catch criminals. But in most democratic countries and even some authoritarian regimes, the technology is not ordinarily employed without any kind of legal process, cybersecurity experts say.
Myanmar activists have called for Telenor to halt or delay the sale. But Rostrup said Telenor felt it had no choice but to withdraw from the country as respecting the EU embargo meant it could not ensure the safety of its employees and allowing the intercept to be activated would be ""a complete breach of our values and principles"". 
Reuters reported in July that senior executives at major telecommunications firms in Myanmar have been told by the junta that they must seek special authorisation to leave the country. The travel ban was followed by a second order instructing telecom firms to fully activate the intercept.
Telenor declined to comment on the travel ban. 
Rostrup said Telenor had chosen M1 after finding it had ""no direct relationships with authorities or the military in Myanmar"".
The deal was submitted to Myanmar authorities for regulatory review recently, he said, adding that the process is expected to take 60 days.
Myanmar rights group told Reuters they believe the telecom is not doing enough.
""Telenor is trying to skirt its human rights responsibilities,"" said Justice for Myanmar spokesperson Yadanar Maung.

""Telenor must cancel the sale and come up with an exit strategy that does not risk the lives of the many Myanmar people who are struggling against the junta"".
Prior to the coup, Telenor had been one of the largest foreign investors in the country with its Myanmar operations accounting for 7% of its total earnings last year. It wrote off its $783 million investment in its Myanmar unit in May.

The Army said it had begun implementing this order in late August, adding that soldiers could request an exemption on legitimate medical, religious or administrative grounds.
However, commanders, command sergeants major, first sergeants and officers in Command Select List positions who refuse to be vaccinated and are not pending an exemption request would face suspension and relief if they refuse to comply, the Army said in a statement.
""While soldiers who refuse the vaccine will first be counseled by their chain of command and medical providers, continued failure to comply could result in administrative or non-judicial punishment – to include relief of duties or discharge,"" it said.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - The four would-be citizen astronauts poised to ride a SpaceX rocket ship around the globe as the first all-civilian crew launched into orbit said on Tuesday they were eager for liftoff on the eve of their flight, feeling only ""the good kind"" of jitters.
""I was just worried that this moment would never come in my life. Let's get going, let's do it,"" said Sian Proctor, 51, a geoscience professor, artist and lifelong space enthusiast who was a 2009 finalist in NASA's astronaut candidate program before she was cut.
Proctor also disclosed she and her flightmates received a telephone call from one of her personal heroes, former first lady Michelle Obama, wishing them well, an honor she said ""would stay with me the rest of my life.""
The ""Inspiration4"" quartet are due for liftoff as early as 8 p.m. on Wednesday (0000 GMT) from launch complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, for an orbital flight expected to last about three days before splashdown.
Proctor and her crewmates - billionaire e-commerce executive and jet pilot Jared Isaacman, 38, physician assistant Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and aerospace data engineer Chris Sembroski, 42 - took reporters' questions at a pre-launch briefing inside a SpaceX hangar a little more than 24 hours before launch time.
Behind them, visible in the distance through the hangar's open doors, stood the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule designed to carry them to a targeted orbital altitude of 360 miles (575 km) over the Earth - higher than the International Space Station.
That is far beyond the inaugural astro-tourism flights made this summer by SpaceX rivals Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, which carried their respective billionaire founders - Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos - along for the ride. 
Those two suborbital trips, while high enough for their crews to experience a few moments of microgravity, were over in a matter of minutes.
The high-orbital flight planned for Inspiration4 carries greater risks, including more exposure to radiation in space. But the crew members professed the utmost confidence in SpaceX, the private California-based rocket company founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.
Isaacman, founder and chief executive of electronic financial services company Shift4 Payments Inc, is the mission's originator and benefactor, having paid Musk an undisclosed but presumably enormous sum to fly all four crew members into orbit. 
Musk joined in on a pre-flight ""check-in"" call on Tuesday, ""and did give us his assurances that the entire leadership is solely focused on this mission,"" Isaacman told reporters when asked about pre-launch nerves. ""No jitters, just excited to get going.""

The Japan Securities Dealers Association said it would set up a panel consisting of scholars, investors and executives from major brokerage houses and startups this month to review the process.
On the Tokyo bourse's Mothers market for start-ups, it is common to see wide gaps between IPO prices and prices fetched on debut, which some startups blame on brokerage houses setting IPO prices excessively low.
Brokerage houses say the wide gaps as a result of high volatility in the Mothers market, where share prices of firms with very small market capitalisations tend to swing wildly.

""We hope to examine the process from various perspectives,"" Toshio Morita, chief executive of the industry group and the former head of  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR)' main securities arm, told a news conference.
He said prices on a firm's market debut were bound to surge due to tight supply, although he said the process had not been reviewed extensively and more flexibility could be introduced.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>","Chinese delivery giants Meituan, Ele.me pledge to not force drivers to register as independent businesss","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's online food delivery giants Meituan and Ele.me both said this week they will not force couriers who do work for them to register as independent businesses, a bone of contention amid ongoing scrutiny of the food delivery sector.
The promise comes as part of a broader push from regulators to improve conditions for 'gig-economy' workers, and during ongoing public scrutiny towards tech companies treatment of said drivers. 
In August, several Chinese regulatory bodies met with a number of Chinese food delivery companies to call for better labour safeguards.
Many drivers for food delivery or ride-hailing apps are hired indirectly by the platform and do not receive basic social or medical insurance https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-regulators-meet-with-delivery-firms-call-stronger-labour-rights-2021-08-07. 
This past week, a social media account covering labour law published an article alleging some drivers working for Meituan and Ele.me were operating as individual businesses, as opposed to employees of the platform company or a third-party company, thereby reducing the platform company's legal obligations to the driver. The piece spread widely across China's internet.
In a social media post published late on Tuesday evening, Meituan wrote that, ""Drivers are important partners of Meituan. When it comes to protecting drivers' labour rights, we must make more improvements and need to do better."" 
The company said that following the publication of regulations targeting food delivery workers last July, it had formed a work group to examine its employment practices. It said this month it issued a document to over 1,000 delivery partners and held a video conference stating it prohibits forcing couriers to register as independent businesses. 

The company added that it aimed to improve its treatment of riders in aspects such as income, social security, and health and safety. On Monday, Meituan said it would change its algorithm be more accommodating towards its drivers when facing tight delivery times.
On Wednesday morning, Ele.me published a statement also pledging not to force drivers to register as independent businesses.

BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. grain merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co said on Wednesday that it had launched a new flavour production facility in China to meet growing demand for beverages and healthy foods.
The new facility - ADM Food Technology (Pinghu) Co Ltd, located in the eastern province of Zhejiang and about one hour away from Shanghai - marks a further expansion by the global grains trader in the nutrition segment.
Nutrition is one of ADM's three main businesses and the company aims to increase the segment's contribution to overall net profits to more than a quarter in the next three to five years, from about 15% currently, Leo Liu, President, Nutrition, Asia-Pacific, ADM, told Reuters.
On the Pinghu plant, Liu said it would serve as ADM's new flavour supply hub for China and the wider Asia-Pacific region, adding it will also be part of ADM's global flavours supply chain, serving clients based in Europe and Americas.
""The reason why we invested in flavours and food ingredients, especially high-end food ingredients, is because the sector is developing very fast. And the market demand and changes require us to have some investment and production bases in China, to better prepare for future development,"" Liu said.
The new plant will provide a wide range of flavour solutions for beverages, sweet goods, dairy and dairy alternatives, and health-related and functional foods, ADM said in a statement.
The launch comes after ADM opened its Plant-based Innovation Lab in Singapore in April to meet growing demand for plant-based proteins in the region. 
ADM, a top global trading house that buys crops from farmers to process and export, reported a 52% leap in its quarterly profit in July, due to strong corn export sales to China and oilseed crushing.
Nutrition delivered 15% revenue growth and 27% higher year-over-year profits in the second quarter. 
Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano said at the time that the company was raising its expectations of full-year profit growth for the nutrition segment to 20%. 

ADM is also stepping up investment in the plant-based protein sector in China, including carrying out application experiments, developing products and building ingredients production bases, Liu said. 
Investment in the nutrition sector, including health-related and functional ingredients, will be a key focus area for the company's development in the region, Liu added.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 03:47AM ET</span>","Equity index giant MSCI to give 10,000 firms global warming ratings","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity index compiler MSCI is to start providing data on how much the world's top 10,000 firms are likely to be contributing to global warning.
The firm, which runs the widely-tracked $60 trillion All Country World Index, is launching Implied Temperature Rise scores, which estimate whether a firm's activities and plans are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
""The idea is to get companies to change their strategies,"" said MSCI's head of ESG and Climate, Remy Briand, who estimates nearly 60% of firms still don't disclose even the most basic environmental data.
MSCI's new approach converts the current and projected greenhouse gas emissions, taking into consideration emissions reduction targets, of each company to an estimated rise in global temperature. 
Projections are calculated by comparing those projected emissions with the global carbon budget that remains if the planet is to keep temperature rise this century below 2°C.
Briand laid out examples using two oil giants,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa). 
Exxon, which has been under heavy scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-carbon/exxon-mobil-under-pressure-on-climate-aims-to-cut-emissions-intensity-by-2025-idUSKBN28O1TL for its approach to climate change, produces a 4C rise score - a scenario that scientists warn would lead to unprecedented heatwaves, severe droughts, and a major rise in sea levels and mass flooding.
Shell produces an implied 2C rise, having set targets to cut the carbon intensity of its products by at least 6% by 2023, by 20% by 2030, by 45% by 2035 and by 100% by 2050. 
""The message is to make the commitment more public,"" Briand said.
His assumption is that because MSCI's indexes and data are used by most of the world's big investors, companies will need to have low implied temperature rise scores to encourage those money managers to park their cash in them.
There are currently no standardised rules around what the big global firms have to disclose about their emissions. Many also make misleading claims that they are on course to hit net zero targets, Briand said, by leaving out large chunks of their business when they make their own projections. 

Briand said leaders going to the UN's COP26 climate change conference in Scotland later this year should pledge to fix those kinds of problems.
""A wish would be to get net-zero commitments across the board for all companies,"" he said. ""If that happens, if it becomes compulsory across many countries, there will an acceleration in companies' strategies"".

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Wednesday, with weak Chinese data and disappointing sales from H&M raising concerns about the global economic recovery.
At 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
Swedish clothing giant  Hennes & Mauritz  (ST:HMb), the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, reported Wednesday disappointing sales growth from a year ago in the three months through August, driving its stock 3% lower.
""Lockdowns and restrictions have continued to hamper development, particularly in Asia. However, as restrictions have been eased, sales in store have picked up in many markets while online sales have continued to increase,"" H&M said, in a statement.
The news was more encouraging at  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of the Zara chain and the world’s largest fashion group, with the Spanish conglomerate’s sales seen 2% above the pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Its stock rose 0.3%.
Earlier Wednesday, data out of China suggested that the world’s second-largest economy, and the main regional growth driver, hit a speed bump in August thanks to Covid-19 outbreaks and supply disruptions.
Retail sales grew 2.5% year-on-year, a sharp drop from July’s 8.5% growth and at the slowest pace since August 2020, while industrial production grew 5.3% year-on-year, its weakest pace since July 2020.
Back in Europe, U.K. consumer prices rose 3.2% on the year in August, a sharp climb from July’s 2.0%, the highest rate since March 2012, while French August annual CPI was confirmed at 1.9%. Neither set of numbers included the surge in energy prices that has happened in September, which reached new heights in the U.K. on Wednesday as a key interconnector cable bringing in power from France was taken offline by a fire.
There are also inflation figures from Italy due later Wednesday, along with Eurozone July industrial production numbers.
This all follows the release Tuesday of a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation for the month of August, creating more uncertainty over the timing of the Fed’s tapering of asset purchases.
Crude prices strengthened Wednesday, boosted by a larger than expected drawdown in U.S. crude stocks coupled with expectations of a substantial recovery in demand as countries get on top of the recent Covid-19 outbreak.
Crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed a hefty draw of 5.4 million barrels last week, after Hurricane Ida shut numerous refineries and offshore drilling production.
Investors now await crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for confirmation.
Additionally, the International Energy Agency predicted on Tuesday that Covid-19 vaccine rollouts could drive an economic rebound, resulting in a sharp jump in demand of 1.6 million barrels a day next month, with continued growth to the end of the year.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sales at fashion retailer H&M grew less than expected in the three months to the end of August, staying below pre-pandemic levels as restrictions kept shoppers away from stores. 
The Swedish group said on Wednesday sales grew 9% from a year earlier, or 14% in local currency terms, to 55.6 billion crowns ($6.46 billion). Analysts polled by Refinitiv on average forecast net sales growth of 14%.
Net sales at the world's second biggest fashion retailer were down 11% from the same quarter of 2019 before the pandemic, when they were 62.6 billion crowns.
H&M, whose shares were down 3% in early trade, said the pandemic continued to hit sales, with considerable variation between markets. 
""Lockdowns and restrictions have continued to hamper development, particularly in Asia. However, as restrictions have been eased, sales in store have picked up in many markets while online sales have continued to increase,"" it said.
H&M returned to profit in its April-June quarter from a loss a year earlier due to the pandemic, with sales 4% higher than in 2019. But sales slowed towards the end of the quarter. 
H&M's recovery has lagged market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, which on Wednesday reported a 7% rise in May-July sales compared to the same period in 2019.
H&M, which is due to publish its full fiscal third-quarter earnings report on Sept. 30, said its recovery continued with more full-price sales and good cost control.

It said about 100 stores were temporarily closed at the end of the quarter, down from about 180 at the start, with continued restrictions in most markets resulting in reduced footfall.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: WHO-backed vaccine hub for Africa to copy Moderna COVID-19 shot,"By Wendell Roelf
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Efforts to develop an African base for COVID-19 vaccine production will focus on trying to replicate  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s shot, but a lack of progress in talks with the U.S. company mean the project will take time, a senior WHO official told Reuters. 
The drive to produce vaccines in Africa is designed to help more developing countries access COVID-19 shots after rich nations bought up most of this year's supply. 
Moderna said last October it would not enforce patents related to its shot during the pandemic, raising hopes that other companies might be able to copy it and help boost COVID-19 vaccine production. 
In practice, though, it is hard to replicate a vaccine without the information on how it is made, and the World Health Organization-backed tech transfer hub in South Africa - set up in June to give poorer nations the know-how to produce COVID-19 vaccines - has so far not reached a deal with the company. 
""The talks have not yielded any results,"" Martin Friede, WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research coodinator, told Reuters. 
Moderna did not respond to a request for comment. 
The case highlights the challenges faced by the WHO as it battles to expand vaccine production to help address the glaring inequalities between rich and poor nations in the pandemic.
More than three quarters of the 5.5 billion COVID-19 shots administered worldwide have gone to high and upper-middle income countries, which make up just over a third of the world's population.
Currently only 3% of Africa is vaccinated, the African Union's top health official said last week, compared with more than half of the United States and three quarters of Spain.
Friede said Moderna's vaccine had been chosen as an abundance of public information and its pledge not to enforce patents made the shot slightly easier to copy than some rivals.
""We have to make a choice now. The deadline is upon us; time to start ordering chemicals. We've chosen Moderna,"" he said.
But even if the hub manages without Moderna's help, it could take more than a year to get a distributable vaccine as clinical trials would only begin in the latter half of 2022, he added. 
TUSSLE OVER WAIVERS
In May, the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic. 
But the idea has faced opposition from pharmaceutical firms, which argue they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its partner BioNTech separately struck a deal in July for South Africa's Biovac to help make around 100 million doses a year of their COVID-19 vaccine for Africa. Their shot, like Moderna's, uses so-called mRNA technology. 
However, the deal is to ""fill and finish"" the vaccine, the final stages of production where the product is put into vials, sealed and packaged for shipping. It does not cover the complicated process of mRNA production, which Pfizer and BioNTech will do at their European plants. 
Neither responded to requests for comment. 
The WHO has been trying to persuade Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to join forces with its African tech transfer hub.
But COVID-19 vaccine makers have warned that non-authorised producers would compete for vital raw materials and production gear that the established players - most of which have earned huge profits from vaccination - rely on.
Hub consortium partner Afrigen Biologics will produce the initial batch of doses, before transferring the skills and technology to local manufacturing partner, Biovac Institute - both are Cape Town-based - which will mass produce the vaccines.
""This is not something that we are asking industry to give us for free,"" Friede said about talks with the companies for access to information, adding that royalties, territorial limitations and other constraints could be built into a deal.

Healthcare analysts doubt the plan can be mobilised quickly.
""There are many steps which will require lots of iterations before they can be ready for prime time commercial grade production,"" said Prashant Yadav, a global healthcare supply chain expert at the Center for Global Development in Washington.

(Reuters) - Snapchat's owner has hired a longtime online safety advocate as its first global head of platform safety,  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) told Reuters on Wednesday, as the company continues to ramp up efforts around user safety and as social media firms face mounting global pressure from regulators and lawmakers. 
Snap said that after a long search it hired Jacqueline Beauchere, who will represent its safety work to regulators, lawmakers and partners and help advise on new policies and initiatives. 
Beauchere was at  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for more than 20 years including as its chief online safety officer. 
Child safety advocates and U.S. lawmakers have raised alarms on a wide range of issues faced by users of online platforms including mental health impacts and potential abuses from bullying to child sexual exploitation.
""We are committed to helping parents, stakeholders and advocates understand how young people experience our products and how we approach critical issues around safety and trust,"" Snap's vice president of global policy Jen Stout said in a statement.
""There is no one better suited to help us accomplish this than Jacqueline, and this work will only become more important as we deepen our focus into augmented reality and the future of computing,"" she said. Beauchere will report to Stout.
Major tech firms are racing to develop smart devices and augmented reality offerings. These raise new challenges around safety and privacy, for example, how such products might invade other people's private spaces or how companies handle information gathered through these devices.
Snap this year launched Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, though they are offered only to AR creators.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) last week unveiled its first smart glasses.
Though Snap's focus on photo-messaging provides fewer mechanisms for viral content than other social media sites, it faces pressures to handle safety issues for a young user base. The platform is also used by children aged 9-12 despite age limit rules, according to a report by nonprofit Thorn in May. (https:// 
Stout said in an interview with Reuters that Snap is developing more proactive technologies to prevent under 13s from signing up for the app. She said it is also revamping its in-app reporting tools to give users more detailed updates when they report platform abuses. Snap also said it would add more safety features to its Snap Map, which lets users share their location with friends.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 12:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China brokers drop yuan forecasts to avoid regulators' ire,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brokerages in China have dropped detailed currency forecasts from their research notes, or have restricted access to them, underlining the growing sensitivity in the financial sector to a regulatory clampdown on speculative investment.
Their disappearance follows pressure to avoid stockmarket forecasts as well as a ban by authorities on publishing commodity prices https://www.reuters.com/article/china-coal-indexes-idUSKBN2G40FN, amid a series of sprawling crackdowns that are re-shaping China's economy and upending financial markets.
It also comes at a delicate moment for the yuan, which China has sought to promote as a global reserve currency https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-economy-yuan-internationlisatio-idUKKCN25A1I6 but which is tightly managed by the central bank and has been stubbornly firm recently despite a broadly strong dollar.
The market effect of publishing only generalised forecasts is unclear, particularly as foreign institutions continue to offer precise ones. Clients can also privately access projections - a useful tool for corporates in managing foreign exchange exposure.
Multiple sources at brokerages and banks said the trend of avoiding detailed public forecasts has become widespread over the past few months.
Reuters' analysis of months of notes from four brokers in China shows once-detailed forecasts for the Chinese currency against the dollar have now vanished or grown fuzzy, with precise predictions replaced by ranges or vague statements. None of these brokers answered to questions about the shift.
Two currency traders at banks said the trend was in response to pressure from China's central bank and its foreign exchange division.
""It's getting way harsh now. If you are asking traders (for yuan forecasts), it will be very inconvenient,"" said one trader at a state-owned bank, who, like the other sources, requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak publicly.
""When the yuan hit sensitive levels a few months ago, the PBOC and CFETS repeatedly asked traders not to make public predictions to guide market expectations,"" he said, referring to the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and the FX trading system it manages.
The PBOC and China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), the forex regulator, did not respond to faxed questions about their position on forecasts.
Another trader said avoiding projecting a rise or a fall in the yuan was in keeping with public comments from SAFE head Pan Gongsheng who in June said that markets should expect two-way volatility and businesses should take a ""risk neutral"" position. 
FUZZY FORECAST
The yuan, which rallied about 13% over the 12 months to a three-year high of 6.3565 in May, has been steady around 6.45 per dollar since June.
But recent state-bank selling points to some possible official discomfort about its strength.
Non-deliverable forwards markets are priced for a slight fall in the yuan to around 6.56 per dollar in six months..
More than a dozen foreign banks, which continue to publish yuan forecasts, declined to comment or had no immediate response when asked whether they faced similar regulatory pressure. The foreign banks were divided on the direction of the currency.
Onshore in China, since June more typical price-level projections, subject to risks, have been replaced in research with ranges and broad statements. 
In May, for example, China's biggest brokerage, CITIC Securities published a note saying the yuan had room to rise and could climb as far as 6.2 per dollar.
But it has since avoided specific forecast levels and in August published research saying the yuan might weaken slightly in the short term, but was overall evenly balanced. CITIC did not respond to emailed questions about the change in forecast.
Research from Shenwan Hongyuan Securities and Zheshang Securities has also shifted from numerical forecasts, offered before June, to vague wording saying the yuan could rise if the dollar fell - or vice versa - or that they expect two-way volatility.
""For mid- to long-term views, we firmly believe that the yuan will appreciate against the dollar for about eight years,"" Zheshang analysts said in note this week.
Zheshang Securities did not answer emailed questions about the changes in research, while Shenwan Hongyuan declined to answer questions about its yuan forecast and referred Reuters back to its own research note.
A fourth broker, Huatai Securities, with offices in Beijing and in Hong Kong omitted detailed forecasts from its recent Chinese-language reports but retained them in English-language notes prepared by analysts in Hong Kong.
Hutai did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
'NO ONE DARES COMMENT'
One onshore broker analyst and another at a bank said private access to forecasts is still available to clients. 
Yet with fewer public research reports to drive a consensus, one outcome of the shift could be a divergence in corporate views on the currency, said Liu Wencai, founder of Shanghai-based risk-management consultancy D-Union.
""Regulators hope that companies don't have consensus views and become the central bank's counterparty,"" he said.
Chinese corporations' dollar deposits stood at an enormous $999.7 billion at the end of August, enough dry powder to shake up the exchange rate if they were suddenly swapped for yuan.

""It seems the authorities have loosened their grip on the currency. But in reality, they are holding it even tighter, not allowing (sharp) appreciation or depreciation,"" said one offshore analyst at a foreign bank who requested anonymity.
""(Our bank) is managing the way how it publishes (forecast) notes on financial platform in mainland; all seems to be very sensitive and no one dares to comment.""

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -Boeing Co delivered 22 airplanes in August amid revived domestic travel and won orders for seven 787s in a respite for a program hobbled by industrial defects and a halt in deliveries. 
The closely watched monthly snapshot comes as Boeing (NYSE:BA) tries to recoup billions of dollars in lost sales from the coronavirus pandemic, and move beyond a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
Of the 22 jetliners delivered last month, 14 were 737 MAX passenger jets and two were P-8 maritime patrol aircraft. 
The remaining six jets were widebodies, including three KC-46 tankers for the U.S. Air Force.
For the year to date, Boeing has delivered 206 aircraft. 
European rival Airbus delivered 40 jets in August to reach 384 since the start of the year.
Through August, Boeing had delivered 169 of its best-selling 737 MAX jets since that aircraft returned to service in late 2020 following a nearly two-year safety ban.
Crucially, Boeing has virtually eliminated a stockpile of up to 200 unwanted jets known in the industry as ""white tails,"" left by the MAX crisis, according to industry sources. 
But it is grappling with structural defects in its bigger 787, which have caused it to cut production and halt deliveries. 
Boeing nonetheless struck an optimistic note with higher industry forecasts on Tuesday, citing a recovery in domestic markets, although international travel remains depressed and coronavirus variants pose potentially new risks.
Boeing said it received orders for 53 aircraft in August, including 35 MAX and 18 widebody aircraft.
Those include 11 777 freighters - one for FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and 10 more from a buyer or buyers Boeing declined to identify. 
Total orders for August, after cancellations and conversions, stood at 23. 
That brings orders for the year so far to 683 or 280 after cancellations, ahead of Airbus' net total of 132.
INDIAN DEAL
Industry sources said Boeing is close to winning an order for some 70-100 737 MAX jets from India's Akasa, a budget startup founded by billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, pending separate talks on a long-term engine service deal.
But it remains in a dispute with Irish budget airline Ryanair, one of its biggest customers, over the pricing of a potential order for up to 250 MAX jets as demand for new airliners picks up in Europe.
Ryanair says it is not prepared to bow to Boeing's pricing demands amid uncertainty over COVID-19 trends and suspended talks last week.
Market sources say Boeing has signalled more confidence on prices after securing orders from United Airlines and others, and after finding homes for all but 20 of the ""white tails"". 

European sources accuse Boeing of slashing prices aggressively to win deals, a charge it denies.
Asked on Tuesday about supplies of MAX jets, Stephen Jones, chief executive of Flair Airlines, told Reuters in Montreal, ""I think it has tightened up quite a lot."" The airline secured MAX jets at what he called a ""great price"" in March.

Son, at the online SoftBank World 2021 conference, said the firm's Vision Fund https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-chinese-startup-agile-robots-raises-220-million-investors-2021-09-09 is involved with 18 companies developing machines enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI), far beyond the dancing and door-greeting capabilities of the cutesy Pepper.
""We had a grandiose debut event with Pepper several years ago, now it is hanging its head low,"" Son said, standing in front of a projection of a slumping, switched-off Pepper.
The SoftBank founder now sees a future with ""smart robots that will replace not just the manufacturing, industrial working population, but the entire working population.""
Son packed his keynote address with videos of humanoid robots running and jumping, as well as canister-shaped machines cleaning floors.
However, he offered no specifics on new investments or market prices of any of the devices, nor did he not touch on SoftBank's investing pause https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/japans-softbank-reports-39-fall-q1-net-profit-2021-08-10 in China where regulators have dramatically increased scrutiny of technology firms.
In June, SoftBank sold 80% of Boston Dynamics, maker of the dog-like ""Spot"", to South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group for $1.1 billion. A month later, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/softbanks-robotics-ambitions-short-circuit-pepper-loses-power-2021-07-21 sales of Pepper, unveiled by Son with much fanfare in 2014, will end in 2023.
Son on Wednesday said SoftBank remains a collaborating partner with Boston Dynamics, and that from Pepper will come a generation of more functional smart robots - or what he called ""smabo"", a contraction of ""smart"" and ""robot"" in Japanese.

Such machines will have the potential to revolutionise the workforce, as one smart robot can do 10 times the daily output of a human, Son said. In Japan, that means 100 million robots could do the work of 1 billion people, he added.
""Humans can be liberated from boring work,"" he said. ""(They) can work on something that has more added value.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Wednesday morning as investors digested weaker-than-expected Chinese data. They also await the impact of lower-than-expected U.S. inflation figures on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s timeline to begin asset tapering.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.42% by 10:18 PM ET (2:18 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.73%. The country released its latest economic data earlier in the day that showed industrial production grew a lower-than-expected 5.3% year-on-year, while fixed-asset investment grew 8.9% year-on-year, in August. Retail sales grew 2.5% year on year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.79%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.82% and South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.06%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.55%.
Meanwhile, efforts to curb the latest COVID-19 outbreak in China’s Fujian province continue, and the latest regulatory tightening and China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt situation also remain on investors’ radars.
Meanwhile, U.S. data released on Tuesday showed that the core consumer price index (CPI) grew 4% year-on-year and 0.1% month-on-month in August. The data also showed that the CPI grew 5.3% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month respectively.
The smaller-than-expected figures lent support to the argument that current inflationary pressures could be temporary, but still left the overall picture undecided.
Investors are now looking to whether the latest figures will prompt the Fed to begin asset tapering, but concerns over the impact of COVID-19's Delta variant on economic reopening remain. Fund managers are less optimistic about global growth and earnings but unwilling to give up on stocks, according to the latest Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey.
Some were not convinced that inflationary pressures will be transitory.
“It is hard to argue at this point that it remains entirely transitory.... you couple that with that fact that there are still all these supply shocks that we are still working through. I think the markets are going to have to feel the pain,” Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) Inc. co-chief investment officer Dana D’Auria told Bloomberg.
Other items on investors’ radars as 2021 heads into its final quarter include the ongoing debate around the U.S. debt ceiling, U.S. President Joe Biden’s tax package, infrastructure spending and the Fed's asset tapering, she added."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Calix (NYSE:CALX) Ltd has lined up an investor to buy a stake in its carbon capture technology unit, valuing the business at A$350 million ($256 million), it said on Wednesday.
Calix's shares rocketed 20% to a record high after the company said Carbon Direct, a New York-based investor, had invested 15 million euros ($18 million) for a 7% stake in Calix's LEILAC Group to back the scaling-up of its technology.
LEILAC, which stands for Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement, is focused on commercialising Calix's patented kiln which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) from limestone in the production of lime and cement. 
The International Energy Agency and the UN's climate panel have said carbon capture is essential to curb global warming. Cement manufacturing accounts for 8% of global carbon emissions, producing more than 4 billion tonnes of CO2 a year, two-thirds of which comes from heating limestone to produce lime and cement.
Calix CEO Phil Hodgson said capturing emissions was a huge business opportunity given the royalties LEILAC could earn as a percentage of carbon prices. In the European Union, the carbon price currently averages around 55 euros per tonne.
""As the world puts emissions trading schemes in place ... it does start to look like a multibillion dollar addressable market,"" Hodgson told Reuters.
Carbon Direct backed LEILAC after Calix completed a two-year pilot test of its kiln at a Heidelberg Cement plant in Belgium in June. Based on the success of that test, Heidelberg Cement and the EU have agreed to fund a scaled-up trial at one of the company's plants in Germany.
""We are very impressed by the technical and commercial rigor of the LEILAC team, and plant partners are outspoken in their excitement about LEILAC,"" Carbon Direct CEO Jonathan Goldberg said in a joint statement with Calix.
Calix aims to complete construction to retrofit Heidelberg's plant for the larger trial in late 2023 or 2024.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets and U.S. bond yields fell on Tuesday after data showed inflation cooling in the Unites States, raising fresh questions on when the U.S. central bank will begin tapering its asset purchases. 
MSCI's world stocks benchmark fell 0.33%, and all 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session lower, with energy and financials falling the most. 
European shares closed 0.1% lower, dragged down by mining, banks and luxury stocks, which followed Asian luxury stocks in falling on a new spike in COVID-19 cases in Fujian, China.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell more than 6 basis points on the day to a low of 1.263%, the lowest reading since Aug. 24.
The U.S. Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up just 0.1% last month, compared with an expected increase of 0.3%. That was the smallest gain in six months, and it indicated that inflation has probably peaked. While that aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held belief that high inflation is transitory, economists and market watchers remain concerned by ongoing supply constraints and labor costs that could continue for months. 
""Today's CPI data came in a bit weaker than expected, but (the Producer Price Index) is at a record high and inflation continues to be a key challenge for investors,” said David Petrosinelli, Senior Trader at InspereX. 
""These trends are indicating labor costs will continue to rise, which could make inflation stickier over the long-term."" 
The Fed will meet next week. The August CPI data lifts some of the pressure the Fed faced to announce it would begin tapering its massive bond-buying program. 
Further delaying this key Fed announcement is ""distorting"" the economy and throwing off markets, said BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder.
""Continuing to stimulate demand higher increases the risk of a severe supply/demand mismatch across economic as well as financial assets,"" said Rieder, also the head of BlackRock’s global allocation team.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 292.06 points, or 0.84%, the S&P 500 lost 25.68 points, or 0.57%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 67.82 points, or 0.45%.
The prospect of a corporate tax hike in the United States from 21% to 26.5% as part of a $3.5 trillion budget bill is also front and center for investors. 
Investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) estimates that if Democrats succeed in raising the corporate tax rate increase to 25% and get half of the hike proposed in foreign income tax rates, it could shave 5% off S&P500 earnings in 2022. In Asia, China's tightening grip on its technology companies again kept investors on edge after authorities told tech giants to stop blocking each other's links on their sites. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.43%. The dollar index fell 0.03 points or 0.03%, to 92.645. The euro was flat against the dollar at $1.1807.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Electric vehicle company Workhorse Group voluntarily dismissed on Tuesday its legal challenge against a U.S. Postal Service (USPS) move to award a multibillion-dollar contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense for delivery vehicles.
The 10-year contract announced in February could be worth more than $6 billion and allows for delivery of between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles. Workhorse had proposed building an all-electric vehicle fleet for USPS, while Oshkosh plans a mix of internal combustion-powered and battery-electric vehicles.
Workhorse's legal challenge, filed in June, had been set to face arguments before a judge on Wednesday on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
Workhorse and Oskhosh did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Tuesday. USPS declined immediate comment.
Lawyers for the Justice Department in July had filed a motion to dismiss Workhorse's challenge, citing its ""admitted failure to exhaust mandatory administrative remedies,"" according to court documents. Oshkosh filed a similar motion.
Workhorse later argued that USPS's administrative remedies violated the U.S. Constitution, the Justice Department said, but it argued that ""Workhorse has forfeited its newfound...challenge by failing to raise it before the Postal Service.""

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has committed to at least 10% of the fleet's being electric vehicles, but has said that with government assistance the USPS could commit to making a majority of the fleet electric within 10 years.
Congress is considering providing USPS billions to speed the adoption of EVs. Earlier this month, a U.S. House of Representatives panel approved $2.4 billion for USPS to buy new EV postal trucks and build charging infrastructure.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese retailer Miniso Group will open a 'flagship' New York store and nearly double its U.S. outlets this year, betting post-pandemic shoppers on a budget will snap up cheap but fun goods for homes and work like $10 soft toy cats and $4 staplers shaped like avocados.
At less than 60 outlets, Miniso's U.S. presence will still be dwarfed by giant low-price retailers like Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), as well as its own home Chinese base of nearly 3,000 stores.
But Miniso says it's moving quickly to take advantage of lower rents in the pandemic-hit U.S. economy, and Vincent Huang, a company vice president responsible for overseas business, told Reuters he ultimately sees potential for ""thousands"" of U.S. stores.
The plan highlights the vaulting ambition of a company founded just eight years ago in Guangzhou that now reels in about $1.41 billion in annual revenue, and is listed in New York with a $4 billion market value. Shares have dropped 2.3% since its October 2020 float, amid a broad COVID-induced retail slump, but it counts the likes of Chinese tech giant Tencent and Hillhouse Capital among investors. 
The expansion also comes at a pivotal moment for malls across the United States, with many storied retail names having succumbed to the scything downturn in sales that swiftly followed the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
Among brands that disappeared from the U.S. retail landscape was Flying Tiger Copenhagen, a Danish variety store chain that is a rival to Miniso in many markets around the world, but closed its 13 U.S. outlets in November last year. 
With some 4,800 stores around the world in more than 90 countries, Miniso will have 54 outlets in the United States by the end of this year, up from 30 at the start, Huang said. 
""We choose to expand our presence in the U.S. now for several reasons, including that the cost of a new store opening following COVID-19 is lower,"" Huang said in a recent interview.
The new stores include the November opening in the recently launched Tangram mall in Flushing, New York - an area known for a vibrant Asian-American community - of Miniso's first outlet in the city, what Huang called a ""flagship"" store taking up 3,300 square feet of space, slightly bigger than a tennis court, selling everything from neck pillows to notebooks and make-up.
'STRATEGIC MARKET'
Expansion costs in the United States had fallen by about 20% mainly due to rental cuts and the pandemic had also made it easier to secure good locations, he said.
""We have always believed that we are an international business and North America is our strategic market,"" he said.
Miniso describes itself as ""a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer"", and has in the past been compared to the Muji chain operated by Tokyo-listed Ryohin Keikaku.
But Miniso's busy stores and bargains place it in a segment occupied by Japan's renowned $1 store chain, Daiso Industries - present in the United States since 2005, with a network of nearly 80 stores including a first East Coast branch also in Flushing. 
Miniso doesn't disclose exact sales numbers for stores in the United States, where it opened its first outlet in California in 2017, but last month it reported it booked about 20% of its 9.07 billion yuan ($1.41 billion) overall revenue for the fiscal year ended June from its 1,800 overseas stores, in countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and India.
Huang said Miniso's U.S. sales have recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels, with sales in the first half of 2021 seeing a rise of 73% year on the year. ""We are more popular than ever since the pandemic,"" he said. 
Helping drive that popularity have been product collaboration collections in recent years with leading trademark holders including Disney, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Marvel Entertainment, resulting in items like Mickey Mouse facial cream, Coca-Cola ceramic mugs and Spider Man mouse pads.

""Ultimately, consumers do not care whether we are Chinese or Japanese, American or European,"" said Huang. ""What concerns consumers is whether they can buy good value products with the least amount of money.""

U.S.-listed shares of Yum China fell 3% in extended trading.
The company said over 500 of its restaurants in 17 provinces were closed or offered only takeaway and delivery service at the peak of the Delta variant's outbreak in August, leading to a mid-teens percentage drop in same-store sales.

""While the outbreak has subsided in recent days and restaurant traffic is gradually recovering, our operations continue to be heavily impacted,"" Yum China said, adding it expects a recovery in same-store sales ""to take time"".
The company said its profit margins were also being pressured by higher commodity prices, wage inflation and an increase in promotions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday as economic uncertainties and the increasing likelihood of a corporate tax rate hike dampened investor sentiment and prompted a broad sell-off despite signs of easing inflation.
Optimism faded throughout the session, reversing an initial rally following the Labor Department's consumer price index report. All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in negative territory in a reminder that September is a historically rough month for stocks.
So far this month the S&P 500 is down nearly 1.8% even as the benchmark index has gained over 18% since the beginning of the year.
""There is a possibility that the market is simply ready to go through an overdue correction,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""From a seasonality perspective, September tends to be the window dressing period for fund managers.""
The advent of the highly contagious Delta COVID variant has driven an increase in bearish sentiment regarding the recovery from the global health crisis, and many now expect a substantial correction in stock markets by the end of the year.
""We're still in a corrective mode that people have been calling for months,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""Economic data points have been missing estimates, and that has coincided with the rise in the Delta variant.""
The CPI report delivered a lower-than-consensus August reading, a deceleration that supports Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's assertion that spiking inflation is transitory and calms market fears that the central bank will begin tightening monetary policy sooner than expected.
U.S. Treasury yields dropped on the data, which pressured financial stocks, and investor favor pivoted back to growth at the expense of value. [US/] 
The long expected corporate tax hikes, to 26.5% from 21% if Democrats prevail, are coming nearer to fruition with U.S. President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion budget package inching closer to passage.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 292.06 points, or 0.84%, to 34,577.57; the S&P 500 lost 25.68 points, or 0.57%, at 4,443.05; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 67.82 points, or 0.45%, to 15,037.76.
All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session red, with energy and financials suffering the largest percentage drops.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its iPhone 13 and added new features to its iPad and Apple Watch gadgets in its biggest product launch event of the year as the company faces increased scrutiny in the courts over its business practices. Its shares closed down 1.0% and were the heaviest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
 Intuit  Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) gained 1.9% following the TurboTax maker's announcement that it would acquire digital marketing company Mailchimp for $12 billion.
CureVac slid 8.0% after the German biotechnology company canceled manufacturing deals for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 107 new lows.

(Reuters) -The Boy Scouts of America on Tuesday secured more than $1 billion in new settlements to resolve sex abuse claims, with $787 million coming from insurance group The Hartford and another $250 million from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of its chartered organizations.
The agreements, announced by Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:HIG) Inc and the Coalition of Abused Scouts for Justice, will be subject to approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein, who oversees the Boy Scouts' bankruptcy.
In exchange for The Hartford's payment, the Boy Scouts and its local councils will fully release the company from any obligation under policies that were mostly issued in the 1970s, the insurer said. The Hartford expects to take a $137 million pretax charge in the third quarter for the higher payout.
Tuesday's agreement replaces the Boy Scouts’ prior deal with The Hartford, under which the insurer said it would contribute $650 million to a proposed trust fund for victims of child sexual abuse as part of the Boy Scouts' bankruptcy case. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is one of many organizations that fund scouting activities and troops and that have also faced sex abuse claims.
Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2020 after being hit with a flood of sexual abuse lawsuits. The Boy Scouts face 82,500 claims of sexual abuse in the bankruptcy.
Last month, Silverstein approved the Boy Scouts’ $850 million settlement with representatives of around 70,000 abuse claimants. That deal is backed by 250 local councils.

With the two new settlements, the total amount of money available to sex abuse claimants in the Boy Scouts bankruptcy is now $1.887 billion. Negotiations with other insurers and chartered organizations are ongoing.
The Boy Scouts have said they are committed to fulfilling their “social and moral responsibility to equitably compensate survivors.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday called on the Federal Reserve to break apart  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, arguing the latest fine against the bank shows it to be an ""irredeemable repeat offender.""
In a letter sent to the Fed, Warren urged the central bank to revoke Wells Fargo's status as a financial holding company and order it to sell off its investment banking and nonbanking activities, citing the bank's years-long struggle to address regulatory shortcomings.
""Wells Fargo is simply ungovernable,"" she said in the letter, the latest in her lengthy campaign against the bank, which has been penalized repeatedly by regulators for a range of issues. 
Warren, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, serves on the Senate Banking Committee.
The bank has paid over $5 billion in fines and has been placed under an unprecedented asset cap by the Fed for selling potentially millions of fake accounts to customers, among other issues, in a series of longrunning scandals https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-scandal-deal/wells-fargo-to-pay-3-billion-to-u-s-admits-pressuring-workers-in-fake-accounts-scandal-idUSKBN20F2KN that led to the ousters of two separate chief executives.
A spokesman for the Fed said the central bank had received the letter and planned to respond. In a statement, Wells Fargo said meeting regulatory expectations on risk management and control ""remains Wells Fargo's top priority"" and said ""significant progress"" had been made.
Warren's letter comes days after Wells was fined $250 million https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/wealth/banking-regulator-fines-wells-fargo-250-mln-over-remediation-shortcomings-2021-09-09 by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which chastised the bank for failing to adequately repay customers who had been charged improper or excessive fees.

In a separate letter to the bank's board, Warren pressed for specifics on current CEO Charles Scharf's compensation, including how much of it was based on the bank's ability to address regulatory shortcomings. She also called for details on the bank's timeline for addressing issues, noting that Scharf has been with the bank for nearly two years.
""You owe your customers, your investors, and your regulators an explanation for Wells Fargo’s ongoing inability to meet legal and regulatory requirements,"" she wrote.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) on Tuesday unveiled an upscale variant of its Challenger 350 business jet as the planemaker vies to protect its dominant market share in the segment and capitalize on higher demand for private flying during the pandemic.
The refreshed variant, named Challenger 3500, seats up to 10 passengers and comes with voice-controlled cabin systems like lighting, and a smaller version of the chaise lounge seats found on Bombardier's flagship Global 7500.
The Challenger 3500, expected to enter service in the second half of 2022, will list for $26.7 million, the same price as the 350, Chief Executive Éric Martel said in an interview.
While Bombardier has focused on paying down debt after facing a cash crunch in 2015, it faces pressure to refresh the Challenger in a market where wealthy buyers demand the latest features. 
During the pandemic, health has risen to the top of concerns of the targeted elite, alongside security and privacy, underpinning demand for private jets.
Martel said the changes would help Bombardier keep Challenger as market leader in the super-midsized segment, which bridges small corporate planes and long-range aircraft that can seat 19. 
""We're raising the bar in that category,"" he said, adding that cabin features are key for Challenger customers.
The plane competes with  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ)'s Praetors,  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT)'s Cessna Citation Longitude and the G280 from General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream Aerospace.
While the new variant would likely stimulate demand, Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard questioned whether the changes are enough, given fierce sector competition.
""If Gulfstream comes out with a clean sheet replacement for the G280, then the Challenger 3500 is likely to have a fight on its hands,"" Stallard said in a note to clients.
Gulfstream said in an emailed statement that it ""remains confident in the G280’s proven track record and are committed to enhancing it even further."" Textron declined to comment. 
Spending on the new 3500 variant is contained within Bombardier's expected capex of $200 million to $250 million, Martel said.
A mockup of the jet, Bombardier's first update of the Challenger 300 family since the 350's entry-into-service in 2014, was on display for a virtual event, confirming a Reuters report on Monday about the launch.
Martel told reporters at an in-person component of the event that a flight test for the Montreal-assembled Challenger 3500 would be done in Wichita, Kansas. 

Bombardier said the mockup will be on display next month in Las Vegas at the business jet industry's largest air show.
Martel said Bombardier is weighing potential major options for its aftermarket division, along with large-cabin Global and Challenger 650 business jets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday it had suspended changes to the government's stake in housing giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) imposed in the final days of the Trump administration.
Those changes are aimed at lifting curbs on the agencies' ability to back certain types of mortgages, including on second homes, multifamily homes and homes bought with higher risk loans, after the Trump administration directed the pair to shrink their footprint in the housing market.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the pair, is reviewing those changes and consulting with Treasury on other possible changes.
The suspension effectively freezes changes put in place in the final days of the Trump administration. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had attempted to draw up a blueprint for the exit of Fannie and Freddie from government control.
In January 2020, the Treasury Department announced it had altered its stake in the pair, including allowing them to retain profits in exchange for a larger government stake in the enterprises.
However, housing advocates worried it could undermine the enterprises' core mission of making housing more affordable.
The pair, which guarantee over half of all U.S. mortgages, have been under government control since a 2008 bailout. Under the rescue agreement, the government swept up the quarterly profits of the enterprises.
FHFA said Tuesday the enterprises will still be allowed to build capital while the suspended policies are under review.
The move was met with quick praise from Democrats. Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown said the previous changes were ""haphazard"" and welcomed the suspension to ensure ""we do not unintentionally restrict access to safe, affordable housing for homeowners and renters.""

However, Senator Pat Toomey, the senior Republican on the banking panel, warned the changes could risk ""overheating an already-hot market.""
Under the Trump administration's plan, Fannie and Freddie would have been able to retain their profits and streamline their business in a bid to slowly rebuild their capital cushions, which could eventually lead to an exit from government control. However, even that plan envisioned it would take years, and still left many legal and policy matters unresolved.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has increased its average starting wage in the United States to more than $18 an hour and plans to hire another 125,000 warehouse and transportation workers, an executive told Reuters.
The world’s largest online retailer has raised pay from an average of around $17 since May. In some locations, the company is giving signing bonuses of $3,000, said Dave Bozeman, vice president of Amazon Delivery Services, or triple what the company offered four months ago.
The fatter paycheck, which Reuters was first to report, shows how big employers are desperate to draw workers in an increasingly tight U.S. labor market. Fewer Americans are seeking jobless claims https://www.reuters.com/business/us-weekly-jobless-claims-near-18-month-low-2021-09-09 just as openings have hit a record in the reopening economy. 
Bozeman attributed Amazon's latest compensation increase to fierce competition. Amazon did not give exact figures, but a $1 raise on a $17-per-hour wage would amount to a hike of about 6%.
Amazon, now the second-biggest U.S. private employer, set a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2018. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc recently touted https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmart-bumps-up-hourly-wages-565000-workers-by-1-ahead-holidays-2021-09-02 average hourly wages of $16.40, while Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc said it would raise its minimum https://www.reuters.com/business/walgreens-raise-minimum-hourly-wage-all-team-members-oct-2021-08-31 to $15 in October.
""It's a tight labor market, and we've seen some of that as the entire industry is seeing,"" said Bozeman, who spoke in an interview at a delivery station in Tukwila, Washington.
He said Amazon would maintain its $15 an hour base pay. Benefits like funding college tuition for workers and starting wages as high as $22.50 in some areas distinguished the online retailer from peers, he said.
MEETING GROWTH
Amazon's news, after logistics hiring it announced in May and corporate recruiting it touted this month https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-ceo-unveils-55000-tech-jobs-first-hiring-push-under-his-watch-2021-09-01, follows a stretch of increased scrutiny of its labor practices.

After that battle, then-CEO Jeff Bezos said the company needed a better vision for employees.
Andy Jassy, who succeeded Bezos, said in a CNBC interview that aired on Tuesday that the United States ought to raise the federal minimum wage.
Amazon is hiring workers to help run 100 logistics facilities launching this month in the United States, on top of more than 250 that opened earlier this year. Some workers will aid in Amazon's long-in-the-works effort to roll out one-day delivery for Prime loyalty club members.
""The 125,000 (warehouse workers) is really to help us keep up with our growth,"" said Bozeman, who added that only a minority of jobs were to address attrition. Amazon said it would fill the roles, which are full- and part-time, as quickly as possible but did not offer a timeline.
The company's external delivery service partners aim to hire another 50,000 workers by year-end, too, Amazon said.

Nicole Bilich, a human resources manager, said competitive pay has brought in applicants for her Stockton, California, warehouse, which Amazon plans to launch in October. But hiring 2,200 people in three to four months is no simple matter.
""The biggest challenge we have is really just the numbers of people we need,"" she said.

""This is risky business and dangerous business"" that Republicans are engaging in, Schumer, a Democrat, told reporters at the Capitol.
There are estimates that sometime in October the Treasury Department could run out of ways to borrow money to finance government debt unless Congress approves a new debt limit.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said Democrats should raise the debt ceiling on their own. On Tuesday, McConnell said: ""Republicans are united in opposition to raising the debt ceiling, not because it doesn't need to be done"" but because he believes Democrats should include it in their $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill and pass it without Republican support.

Nevertheless, Senator Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed optimism to reporters on Tuesday that Congress would approve a debt ceiling increase in a timely manner, despite the opposition from many lawmakers in his party.
""I think ultimately we will, after stops and starts - we will pass a debt limit of some kind. Otherwise, the alternative is not good,"" Shelby said.

Generali said a majority of non-executive directors had expressed appreciation for Donnet's work at a meeting on Tuesday and had welcomed his willingness to be re-appointed when the insurer names a new board in the spring.
Two people close to the matter said eight out of 12 board members at the meeting were in favour of Donnet.
Generali said the outgoing board would put forward Donnet as CEO if it decided to file its own slate of nominees - as it is allowed to do for the first time after a change in the company's by-laws last year.
Donnet's reappointment has been challenged by two leading Generali investors, construction magnate Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio.
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio, respectively Generali's No.2 and No.3 investor, are ready to support an alternative CEO candidate, sources have said, while Donnet has the backing of Generali's single biggest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).

Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are also investors in Mediobanca, Italy's leading investment bank.
In a sign that simmering tensions are coming to a head, Del Vecchio and Caltagirone on Saturday unveiled a consultation pact over their combined 11% Generali stake.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has hired a  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) executive, Candi Castleberry Singleton, as vice president of global diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), according to a staff memo on Tuesday that it shared with Reuters.
The company had upgraded the role from a director-level position. Castleberry Singleton's job will be to help Amazon meet diversity goals it laid out in April, among them, doubling the number of Black leaders at the company from a year ago and increasing women in senior tech roles by 30%.
The world's largest online retailer recently came under scrutiny for alleged discrimination. It has faced at least six https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazoncom-faces-five-new-racial-gender-bias-lawsuits-2021-05-19 lawsuits this year claiming racial bias, gender bias or both suffered by women who worked in corporate or warehouse management roles.

In Tuesday's memo, Senior Vice President Beth Galetti said Castleberry Singleton starts next month. She ""will join my leadership team and be the driver of our bi-weekly DEI updates with the S-team,"" referring to the company's most senior executives.

Castleberry Singleton, who identifies as Black, was a vice president at Twitter after a decades-long career in business and academia, according to Amazon.

Investing.com -- Stocks fell after data that showed inflation in August ran cooler than expected, setting off a new wave of worries about how the Federal Reserve will respond.
Officials from the central bank meet next week and are expected to discuss the timing of the taper -- when the bank will start to pare back its massive monthly bond purchases that helped blunt the economic hit from the pandemic last year.
The timing of that decision has made for a choppy month in the markets, with investors going back and forth from euphoria over the progress of the recovery to fear that the good times are about over.
The Labor Department said consumer prices rose at their slowest pace in six months in August. July's reading was also a slight slowdown from the prior month. All along, Fed officials have said they believed any inflation from the reopening would be transitory.
Consumer prices for everyday goods are still high, however. And last week we had even stronger readings on producer price inflation. 
Next up come retail sales figures, but not until Thursday. 
Earnings season is largely behind us, but there is a smattering of other data of note this week. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow: 
1. Industrial output
Growth in industrial output is likely to have cooled down to 0.4% in August from 0.9% in July, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The data are released at 9:15 AM ET (1315 GMT).
2. U.S. crude inventories
With yet another storm slamming the Gulf coast region this week, oil has been in the spotlight. Crude oil inventories in the U.S. for last week are seen eroding by more than double the prior week’s level. Analysts expect a draw of 3.903 million barrels after falling by 1.529 million barrels in the earlier week. The Energy Information Administration releases the data at 10:30 AM ET.
3. Gasoline inventories
Gasoline inventories, too, are seen lower but the pace of the decline is likely to have slowed considerably. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect a draw of 1.967 million barrels for the week compared to the bigger draw of 7.215 million barrels a week earlier.

(Reuters) - Another grain export terminal near Louisiana's Gulf Coast shuttered for two weeks by Hurricane Ida restarted operations this week even as heavy rains from Tropical Storm Nicholas battered the region on Tuesday.
Global grain trader Cargill Inc said it had reopened its Westwego, Louisiana, grain export terminal and on Monday unloaded its first grain barge since Ida came ashore on Aug. 29 and crippled shipments from the busiest U.S. grain export hub.
Cargill is the latest major grain trader to revive export operations after Ida devastated the region's power grid and damaged some of the nearly dozen grain terminals dotted along the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico.
Heavy rains from Nicholas lashed storm-battered Louisiana again on Tuesday after coming ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast, bringing the threat of floods and more power outages. The storm was expected to move over Louisiana, Mississippi and the Florida panhandle through Thursday.
Power was finally restored to Cargill's heavily damaged terminal in Reserve, Louisiana, on Monday for the first time since Ida, but the company is still assessing damages from that storm and developing ""phased reopening plans,"" Cargill spokeswoman April Nelson said.
Cargill is monitoring rains from Nicholas on Tuesday, but it has not confirmed any impact on recovery efforts, Nelson said.
Rival exporters Louis Dreyfus Co and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co have been loading export shipments for several days, while a facility owned by  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd remains shuttered, according to the companies and shipping sources.
CHS Inc and Zen-Noh Grain, which also operate large grain terminals near the Louisiana Gulf Coast, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on their recovery efforts.
U.S. grain exports hit their lowest level in years last week as shippers struggled to restart their facilities at the Gulf, where some 60% of U.S. crop exports exit the country.
The U.S. corn harvest is starting, meaning more grains will be available to move in coming weeks. 
Nine grain vessels were loading for export at Gulf terminals and floating rigs this week, up from just three late last week, a barge broker said.
Louisiana state officials said rains from Nicholas are complicating the recovery from Ida, particularly in flooded parishes and those still without power, and in areas along flood-swollen rivers.
""We've gone through this sort of thing in the past, where we will get two storms at a time during the peak of hurricane system,"" said Mike Strain, commissioner of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture. ""It complicates matters.""

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>",Boeing raises jet demand forecast on pandemic recovery,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) revised up long-term demand forecasts on Tuesday, as a snapback in commercial air travel in domestic markets like the United States tempers the more gloomy industry predictions seen at the height of coronavirus lockdowns last year.
The rosier view underpins moves by the aerospace giant to prepare for growth in travel demand and military services, even as its own ability to respond to the brighter outlook remains hampered by industrial delays and the lingering 737 MAX crisis.
The U.S. planemaker, which dominates jet sales together with Europe's Airbus, forecast 43,610 commercial jet deliveries over the next 20 years worth $7.2 trillion, an increase of 500 units from the 43,110 projected a year ago. 
On a shorter 10-year view, which is more sensitive to the severe fallout on airlines from the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing sees 19,330 deliveries, up from last year's forecast of 18,350. 
The 10-year projection is 6% shy of the forecast it published in 2019, but the drop from pre-crisis levels has narrowed from 11% a year ago. 
""One of the strongest reasons for confidence is how quickly we have seen a bounce-back in domestic travel in the last 12 months,"" Boeing Chief Strategy Officer Marc Allen told reporters.
Boeing sees domestic flying at pre-crisis levels in 2022 followed by regional traffic in 2023 and international in 2024.
Demand for airliners is seen as a bellwether for the wider economy. Boeing raised its assumption for average annual global economic growth to 2.7% from 2.5% from last year's forecast.
Boeing and other planemakers are predicting that environmental pressure and COVID-19 will accelerate the retirement of jets, leaving room for new planes in the market. 
But several analysts have raised concerns about the unpredictable spread of coronavirus variants and ongoing travel restrictions, even as vaccination rates steadily increase.
SHIFTING EMPHASIS 
Boeing's forecast for annual passenger traffic growth was unchanged at 4%, although the growth rate has edged lower since 2015 from the once-reliable 5% as a record aviation boom peaked. 
Over the next decade, Boeing sees demand for $9 trillion of goods and services in the full array of markets it operates in, from freighters to fighters, up from $8.7 trillion a year ago.
Its defense and space forecast is flat at $2.6 trillion.
The shift of emphasis toward services comes as mounting budget pressures are expected to limit arms spending and further prolong the use of systems already in the U.S. arsenal. Boeing last year began delivering refurbished and modified F/A-18 jets.
Boeing slightly increased its 20-year forecast for deliveries of twin-aisle models like its 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 to 7,670 jets, up from 7,480 previously. 
The segment remains the hardest hit by the crisis as widespread border restrictions choke international air travel. 
Boeing is currently grappling with a halt in 787 deliveries due to production problems, cutting off a key source of cash.
For medium-haul single-aisle jets like its 737 MAX - the industry's No. 1 cash cow - Boeing sees 32,660 deliveries over the next 20 years, up from the previous 32,270.
Boeing's 737 MAX returned to service late last year after a nearly two-year safety ban. It recently won approval in India, although a lingering ban in China raises uncertainty. 

Boeing also cut its 20-year forecast for freighter demand to 890 jets from the 930 it projected a year ago. 
Demand for freighters has soared during the pandemic as shippers sought alternatives to the belly space of passenger jets, left on the ground due to weak travel demand. Both Boeing and Airbus are proposing to develop new all-cargo planes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration said most federal employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no later than Nov. 22 as it drafts rules to require large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly.
President Joe Biden last week signed an executive order requiring federal employees who work in the Executive Branch to be fully vaccinated with certain limited exceptions.
In guidance to federal agencies posted on a federal website on Monday, the Biden administration said agencies should move ""expeditiously so that their employees are fully vaccinated as quickly as possible and by no later than November 22.""
In July, Biden said federal workers had to get vaccinated or face regular COVID-19 testing, along with other safety rules such as mandatory face covering at workplaces and restrictions on official travel.
The recent surge in U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths caused by the Delta variant of the virus moved the administration to take a tougher stance on vaccines, which they see as the best way to protect the economy and end the pandemic.
Federal regulators are separately drafting an emergency temporary standard covering more than 80 million private sector employees who work for businesses with more than 100 workers.
Biden also on Thursday signed an executive order requiring vaccines for millions of federal contractors ""that do 
business with the federal government.""

Some major companies are still unclear if they are covered under the contractor mandate executive order, while one major business group on Monday https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/biden-vaccine-mandate-will-test-us-workplace-regulator-2021-09-13 asked for answers to numerous questions surrounding the planned requirements for private sector employers.

Since Britain fully left the EU last December, the bloc has asked banks to move euro clearing from London, which accounts for the bulk of activity, to Frankfurt.
So far, banks and their customers have put on a united front against relocating clearing, saying it would bump up costs by splitting markets.
Bailey said banks were waiting rather than shifting euro positions as a June 2022 deadline looms when temporary permission for London clearers to serve EU customers ends.
""The right thing to do is to wait for the moment. The cost of moving and fragmenting are too large,"" Bailey told a Bloomberg event.
""While waiting is sensible from the point of view of the banks, it puts the responsibility on the authorities to sort the thing out,"" Bailey said.
However, negotiations with the EU at the present time have not been particularly intense, but the BoE was happy to give EU regulators the assurances they need, he said.
""If they want to take a decision to break the system up, then it's important to consider the risks to financial stability that come with fragmentation.""

Clearers in the United States already have EU permission to serve customers in the bloc.
""We could see some clearing of euro instruments switch to New York from London if this does not get sorted out,"" NatWest bank chairman Howard Davies told the same event.

(Reuters) - Pacaso, a property co-ownership sales and management platform launched only about a year ago, said on Tuesday it raised $125 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 2 which valued the company at $1.5 billion.
Pacaso buys luxury homes, renovates and furnishes them, and then finds up to eight owners to buy a share of the property. The property is then managed through Pacaso’s SmartStay app between the owners who may not know each other. 
""Owning a second home is an aspiration many, many families share. But it tends to be out of reach for most people because second homes are very expensive and they're also highly underutilized,"" said Austin Allison CEO and co-founder of Pacaso.
The company makes money on reselling the property and a fee for using the management app, said Allison.
The fast growing startup, already operating in 25 destinations in the United States, has also quickly hit some pushback. 
In May, a local newspaper https://www.sonomanews.com/article/business/sonoma-neighbors-vow-to-stop-controversial-new-homebuying-model in Sonoma Valley, California’s wine region, reported neighbors of a co-owned Pacaso home posting signs “Pacaso time shares not welcome here” and there are at least two petitions on change.org.

Allison said Pacaso “is actually part of the solution” and not causing housing shortages as it helps people looking for second homes pool funds together to buy luxury homes rather than compete for regular residential homes. 
Allison said Pacaso manages nearly $200 million worth of real estate on its platform. The company will also expand into Spain by the end of the year as it starts its global expansion, he said.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended flat on Tuesday, with miners, banks and luxury stocks leading declines as optimism over cooling U.S. inflation growth in August proved to be short-lived. 
The region-wide STOXX 600 index inched 0.01% lower, with the basic resources sector index dropping 1.9% and banks sliding 1.1%.
""Having got off to a positive start yesterday, today's price action looks set to follow the pattern of last week, where after a similar Monday rally, sentiment deteriorated as concerns about profit margins in the face of rising prices saw certain sectors come under further pressure,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 
Luxury stocks, including LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP), Richemont and Burberry, fell between 1.9% and 3%, tracking moves in Asia on concerns about the spread of COVID-19 cases in China. 
""Ongoing China coronavirus concerns and lockdowns in several cities in Fujian are not helping sentiment,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.
Home to many luxury names, France's CAC 40 fell 0.4%, while the UK's miner-heavy FTSE 100 shed 0.5%.
Still, many strategists expect European equities to outperform this year due to relatively high rate of vaccinations and catch-up trade in cheaper segments of the market such as banks and energy. 
Data earlier in the day showed underlying U.S. consumer prices increased at their slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that inflation had probably peaked, though it could remain high for a while amid persistent supply constraints.
The report supported sentiment for a brief while in midday trading as investors were hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely delay its announcement of cutting back monetary stimulus. 
""While we initially saw markets spike on the prospect of a more patient Federal Reserve, we have since seen traders realise that today's data is unlikely to push the Fed to change course,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.

So, will increased meme investor interest help the stock attain fresh highs soon? Read more to find out.
Headquartered in Canada, Cameco Corporation (CCJ) is the world’s largest publicly traded uranium manufacturer and supplier. The company has a licensed capacity to produce 53 million pounds of uranium annually because its operations are backed by 455 million pounds of proven and probable mineral reserves.
As a critical element in carbon-free nuclear energy production, yellow cake plays a vital role in clean energy production. With major economies investing heavily to increase renewable energy production in lieu of fossil fuels, CCJ is poised to emerge as a major supplier of uranium globally.
However, recently, uranium prices reached six-year highs, bolstered by Sprott Physical Uranium Trust’s immense buying spree. This, coupled with increased retail investor interest in the commodity, fueled by Reddit group r/UraniumSqueeze, has driven CCJ to a 123.6% price gain over the past year and 82.5% year-to-date.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain will be piloting a digital version of the pound within a few years to cut the cost of money transfers, NatWest bank chairman Howard Davies said on Tuesday.
Central banks across the world as studying whether to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a digital version of their currency, to stay abreast of rapid technological developments in payments systems.
The Bank of England has yet to decide on whether to push ahead with a sterling CBDC.
""I suspect that within three to five years we will see that operating in the UK on a sort of pilot basis to start with,"" Davies told a Bloomberg event.
A CBDC is a logical development, though problematic from a banking point of view, as cash gradually finds its way out of the economy, Davies said.
Meanwhile crypto assets like bitcoin were ""environmentally disastrous"" and of no use for transactions apart from buying cocaine on the dark web, he said.
""It's not a store of value, it's too volatile,"" Davies said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told the same event that central banks were evaluating a CBDC.
""I don't think the Bank of England and the UK is behind on this issue,"" Bailey said.
""We have to answer the question - exactly what problems are we sorting out here? We have got to be very clear on what it is that we think the digital currency will do, and what it will do to improve the system,"" Bailey said.

The European Central Bank has already decided to push ahead with designing a digital euro, though the actual launch could be five years away.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety regulator said Tuesday it has asked 12 major automakers for assistance as part of its probe into crashes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles striking emergency vehicles while using advanced driver assistance systems like Autopilot.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sent letters to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and others questions as the agency conducts a ""comparative analysis"" with other ""production vehicles equipped with the ability to control both steering and braking/accelerating simultaneously under some circumstances.""
In August, NHTSA opened a formal safety probe into Tesla driver assistance system Autopilot after 12 crashes with emergency vehicles. The probe covers 765,000 U.S. Tesla vehicles built between 2014 and 2021.
Tesla's Autopilot handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods. Tesla says Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane.
The agency asked the 12 automakers to list any crashes in which an advanced driver assistance system was engaged at ""anytime during the period beginning 30 seconds immediately prior to the commencement of the crash.""
The letters also seeks details on its driver assistance systems ensure drivers pay attention and how they detect if drivers are engaged. NHTSA gave some automakers until Nov 3 to respond and others until Nov. 17.
NHTSA also automakers to detail ""strategies for detecting and responding to the presence of first responder / law enforcement vehicles.""

On Aug. 31 NHTSA sent Tesla a 11-page letter on with numerous questions it must answer by Oct. 22, as part of its investigation. NHTSA said it had reports of 17 injuries and one death in the 12 crashes.
Earlier this month, NHTSA confirmed it was also investigating a July 26 fatal crash in New York of a 52-year-old man was struck by a Tesla as he was attempting to fix a flat tire on his vehicle.

Maura Healey, the attorney general, announced the probe after the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier disclosed the breach on Aug. 16.
The breach exposed names, birthdays, social security numbers, driver's license information, PIN numbers and other data belonging to an estimated 13.1 million current and 40 million former and prospective T-Mobile customers.
It was one of many cyberattacks in recent years across several industries, affecting banks, gas pipelines and hospitals, among other operations.
T-Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It has said the breach did not expose financial, credit card or other payment information.
Healey plans to investigate whether the Bellevue, Washington-based company had proper safeguards to protect customers' personal information and mobile devices.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission opened a related probe last month.
Consumers and other private plaintiffs have filed at least 23 lawsuits against T-Mobile over the breach, court records show.

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) fell 1.3% Tuesday as the manufacturer’s fresh forecast for jet demand underwhelmed.
The American plane maker sees 43,610 commercial jet deliveries worth $7.2 trillion over 20 years, an increase of 500 units from the 43,110 projected a year ago.
But the market was more focused on the shorter 10-year horizon, which the company said is likely to see 19,330 deliveries, still short of the forecast it gave in 2019 even as it is narrower from the 11% gap seen a year back.
Passenger traffic growth is projected to grow by 4% per year, unchanged from last year's forecast but slower than the 5% growth the segment grew by at its peak around 2015.
Boeing cut its 20-year demand forecast for freighter planes to 890 units from the 930 it gave a year ago.
Demand for more than 32,500 new single-aisle planes is about equal to the pre-pandemic outlook. These models continue to command 75% of deliveries in the 20-year forecast, the company said.
Carriers will need more than 7,500 new widebody airplanes by 2040 to support fleet renewal and long-term passenger and air cargo demand growth in longer-haul markets. These projections are up slightly compared to 2020 but remain down 8% from 2019, according to the company.

1227,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>","Amazon Boosts Wages, Pledges to Hire 125,000 Amid Labor Shortage","(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). boosted pay as it looks to hire 125,000 warehouse and shipping workers amid a tight U.S. labor market.
The e-commerce giant said starting wages for open jobs in logistics average $18 an hour, or 20% more than the $15-an-hour base pay the company set back in 2018, with signing bonuses of as much as $3,000 in some locations. Earlier this month, Amazon pledged to hire 40,000 people to fill corporate and tech roles.
A nationwide labor shortage has U.S. companies scrambling to find workers as the economy recovers from the pandemic. They’re boosting pay, offering signing bonuses and offering education perks. 
In another effort to sweeten the pot and keep up with rivals, Amazon last week said it would pay college tuition for some frontline employees. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. in July said it would pay the costs of tuition and books for its hourly staffers.  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) last month said it would offer free undergraduate degrees to more than 340,000 employees at its U.S. stores. 
Amazon typically ramps up hiring in the fall to ensure it has enough workers for the crucial holiday shopping season, and often kicks that off with a string of announcements about its hiring goals. 
The company has been on a recruiting tear of late, adding more than 400,000 workers last year as the pandemic sent locked-down shoppers rushing online. Last year, Amazon added about one logistics facility a day, and is likely on pace to exceed that total in 2021. The company on Tuesday said it had opened more than 250 new fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations and air-cargo hubs in the U.S., and will open 100 additional buildings in September. 
The company employed 950,000 people in the U.S. at the end of June, out of 1.3 million worldwide. Most of those people work in the company’s massive logistics division, primarily in the warehouses that store and pack items. Amazon shares were up slightly in New York on Tuesday morning. 
Amid the hiring spree, Amazon has been roiled by labor unrest, including a failed attempt to unionize a facility in Alabama. Jeff Bezos earlier this year pledged to focus more on the welfare of Amazon workers, a sentiment echoed by his successor, Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy.

Furthermore, if the Biden Administration's $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, which is tied to the Senate-approved $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, is passed, the industry should benefit significantly. Specifically, we think quality industrial machinery stocks  Cummins Inc . (NYSE:CMI), Nordson (NASDAQ:NDSN), and Crane Co. (CR) are among companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Let’s discuss.The industrial machinery sector, which had been severely impacted by global lockdown measures and supply chain constraints, has been making a strong comeback over the past few months. A resumption in economic activities, rapid vaccination programs, and supportive government policies have aided the sector’s rebound. The global industrial machinery market is expected to reach $835.34 billion by 2026, registering a 3.6% CAGR.
Following the Senate's passage of a $1.2 trilling infrastructure bill last month, Democrats are pushing a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted that the infrastructure bill would not be voted on until the Senate passed the $3.5 trillion spending plan. If this bill is passed, the overall spending on infrastructure should propel the growth of the industrial machinery market.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on industrial machinery stocks Cummins Inc. (CMI), Nordson Corporation (NDSN), and Crane Co. (CR). These stocks are well-positioned to benefit from the approval of the infrastructure bill and deliver solid returns in the near term.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>","As oil-well backlog shrinks, U.S. shale may upset investors and drill more","By Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - U.S. energy producers have cut so deeply into a once-large reserve of oil wells waiting to be turned on they soon may have to resume drilling to keep production from sagging, executives and analysts said. 
This would mean an increase in spending which could unsettle investors who have benefited from shale companies' recent prioritization of shareholder returns over ramping up production.
Companies, including Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG), Pioneer Natural Resource and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), for example, have redirected rising cash returns to dividend growth, variable distributions, buybacks, and further debt reduction.
Investors, frustrated with years of low returns from the sector, have punished companies that have looked to grow production at the expense of shareholder return and rewarded those that have shown capital discipline. 
Drilling new wells could add to supply at a time when oil is selling for $70 per barrel, a profitable level for U.S. shale and OPEC producers alike. 
Those high prices, hurricane shut-ins at U.S. offshore wells and a rapidly shrinking backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted shale wells may spur producers to restart drilling and test their pledge to keep spending flat. 
The backlog of shale wells waiting to be turned on has fallen sharply, the latest U.S. data shows, shrinking a reserve that allowed companies to maintain output without spending more.
Some executives say more shale will be needed to offset normal production declines and hurricane losses, and investors will have to accept it. ""Spending in 2022 will have to be higher just to sustain volumes enjoyed in 2021 and I think in general Wall Street is aware of that,"" said Nick O'Grady, chief executive at Northern Oil and Gas Inc, which owns stakes in wells in Texas and North Dakota. 
FOUR YEAR LOW 
New wells cost about $7 million apiece with drilling representing about 30% of the total. With oil at $70 a barrel, producers could put more money into drilling and still manage to increase shareholder payouts, analysts said. 
The number of drilled but uncompleted wells, called DUCs, fell to 5,957 in July, the lowest in four years, from nearly 8,900 at its 2019 peak, based on U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
Graphic: Oil well completions outpace new drilling: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-OIL/xmpjoowdqvr/chart.png 
Tapping DUCs has helped to keep capital spending flat. A group of 31 oil and gas producers tracked by investment firm Cowen plan to spend just 1% more this year than last, even as oil prices have jumped. 
U.S. companies increased crude volumes by 11% to 12 million barrels per day in 2019. But this year's output is running about 11.4 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the EIA, and will shrink by 100,000 bpd through the end of this year, on losses from Hurricane Ida, the EIA said. 
Linda Htein, a director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said completing DUCs was a great way to sustain production without adding a bunch of rigs or increasing capital expenditure.  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) has slashed its DUC backlog in the last 18 months. The shale producer may soon hire a third fracking crew, Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said this month at the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) CEO Energy-Power Conference. 
""Right now, we're sticking with two,"" he told investors.
INVENTORY SHRINKING 
At current well completion rates, the EIA estimates that the top U.S. shale field responsible for U.S. oil gains in the last decade has less than six months of DUCs remaining. 
Unless shale producers start drilling new wells, exhausting the DUC backlog ""could limit oil production growth in the United States in the coming months,"" the EIA said. 
The number of oil rigs recently drilling in the United States was about 401, data from Baker Hughes Co showed on Friday. But that rig count is historically low compared with other periods when crude oil futures prices were near similar levels or at even lower prices. 
Graphic: U.S. crude futures prices vs U.S. oil rig count: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjjawlve/Crude%20Price%20vs%20Rig%20Count.png 

DUCs have been a ""very powerful short term fix, but are not a long term solution,"" said Mark Finley, a former BP (NYSE:BP) Plc economist who is an energy researcher at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. 
""At some point the inventory of excess drilled but uncompleted wells will run out.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened cautiously higher on Tuesday after the slowest rise in consumer prices in seven months eased fears that the Federal Reserve will take abrupt action to tighten monetary policy.
Official data showed that prices excluding food and energy rose only 0.1% in August, rather than the 0.3% expected, while the annual core inflation rate fell to 4.0% from 4.3% in July. Overall, prices rose by 0.3% on the month and 5.3% on the year, both marginally lower than expected.
The figures showed cooling demand for used cars, which had been one of the biggest drivers in prices earlier in the year, as well as a 9.1% drop in airline fares, as Covid-19 ate into the strong summer tourist demand that airlines had been hoping for.  Weakness in those areas was partially offset by a rise in rents, reflecting the surge in house prices over the last year.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 79 points, or 0.2%, at 34,949 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.  
""Effectively we have a moderation in the re-opening hotspots of the past four months,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist with ING, a note to clients. However, he warned that broader inflationary pressures are unlikely to go away in the next couple of months, saying that headline inflation will stay close to 5% through the first quarter of next year.  Knightley pointed to the Fed's Beige Book research, which last week said that businesses were finding it relatively easy to pass on higher input costs to customers. That was endorsed by the monthly survey of the National Federaion of Independent Business on Tuesday, where 49% of respondents said they are currently raising prices
""Given the decent growth and elevated inflation environment in the U.S., we expect the Federal Reserve to announce the (quantitative easing) taper process in November and expect the Fed to raise interest rates twice in late 2022,"" Knightley said.
Among large caps, there were bigger individual moves to the downside rather than the upside. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock fell 9.0% and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) stock fell 9.6% on a report saying that Beijing wants stronger regulation of the Macau gaming sector, extending the buzzkill from its crackdown on videogames. Software giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), meanwhile, fell 3.9% after reporting a soft fiscal first quarter and saying that revenue would be nearly stagnant on the year in the current three months. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock, which has hit a string of record highs in recent weeks, fell over 4% after a company executive was reported as telling an investor conference that net customer additions in its cable business had slowed since the end of August. 
On the upside,  FuelCell Energy  (NASDAQ:FCEL) stock, which has lost over three-quarters of its value from its February peak, rose 27% after its quarterly revenue rose more than expected, narrowing the company's net loss. "

Faury was speaking to an economic conference hosted by the International Economic Forum of the Americas by video link from the United States where domestic travel has been recovering from the pandemic. Global business travel remains sluggish, however.
""We see already a recovery, but (business travel) is unlikely to be back to 2019 levels for many years. There are also companies that are trying to reduce travel to cut emissions,"" Faury said.

""There are a lot of business seats that are occupied by people who are not flying for business purposes. They are flying for leisure or meeting their friends and families.""

Investing.com – Wynn Resorts stock (NASDAQ:WYNN) fell 9%  Tuesday on fears the local authorities will tighten supervision of casinos operating on the peninsula.
Macau, known as Asia’s Las Vegas, lies off Hong Kong and is part of China. Wynn owns two properties in Macau, Wynn Palace and  Wynn Macau  (OTC:WYNMF).
According to a Bloomberg report, the local authorities want government representatives to supervise casino operators and higher local ownership in gaming companies operating in the region.
China has been clamping down on high-stakes betting in Macau which takes place in convertible Hong Kong dollars. It is believed the gambling trades enable illicit outflow of currency and money-laundering efforts.
The proposal by the local authorities also includes reviewing the number of gaming licenses and their terms. Current licenses expire in June next year.
Wynn’s second-quarter operating revenue from Wynn Palace was $270.4 million and $184 million from Wynn Macau, totaling to about 46% of its overall operating revenue.  
The proposed measures, if implemented, will be in line in with recent attempts by the Chinese government to develop a model state and cleanse the society of aspects it considers harmful to society. This has so far included capping the number of hours children can spend on online games to tightening the ways the country’ tech companies can use consumer data."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) plans to replace its finance chief at year-end, with Denis Coleman taking over from current CFO Stephen Scherr, according to an internal memo dated Tuesday and seen by Reuters.
Coleman, 47, is co-head of the global financing group in Goldman's investment banking division, a role his two predecessors had before becoming CFO. He becomes Scherr’s deputy CFO immediately.
Goldman’s global treasurer, Beth Hammack, will replace Coleman in that position.
The CFO role did not have much cachet on Wall Street until the 2008 financial crisis, when those executives were explaining the mortgage meltdown and investment losses to shareholders. 
Since then, bank CFOs have become crucial emissaries to investors, regulators and employees, as well as the broader public. The position is viewed as a stepping stone to bigger things, including a CEO role.
Scherr, 57, has been Goldman’s finance chief since November 2018, around the time CEO David Solomon took his seat.
Scherr has helped Solomon imagine and execute a vision for the fifth-largest U.S. bank as Goldman tries to become more like rivals with large businesses outside of trading and investment banking. 
That included acquiring deposits, unveiling a credit card with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and launching new services for institutional customers.
In prior roles, Scherr oversaw Goldman's identity shift from a Wall Street firm to a traditional bank that takes deposits and makes loans.
Solomon celebrated Scherr’s “work ethic, command of complexity and unfailing commitment to the firm” in his memo announcing the changes.
Scherr will remain CFO through year-end, which means analysts and investors can engage with him on Goldman’s quarterly results call in mid-October and have time to get accustomed to Coleman, who is relatively unknown.
Scherr joined Goldman in 1993 as an associate in its financial institutions group and was also key to Goldman’s Latin America business before running its consumer operations.

He formally retires at the end of January, after which he will become a senior director. One of his predecessors, David Viniar, remains on Goldman’s board of directors.

In May, the company had hired investment banks to prepare for an IPO this year, which could value it at around $5 billion, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-remittance-processor-remitly-hires-advisers-ipo-sources-2021-05-06, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Founded in 2011, Remitly is a cross-border remittance provider to customers, who are primarily immigrants, in more than 135 countries across the world.

The company was inspired by co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Oppenheimer's time in Kenya, where he was able to observe first-hand the difficulties faced by families to send money overseas. 
Remitly earns from transactions fees and foreign exchange spreads. Its revenue more than doubled to $257 million last year, and it incurred a net loss of $32.6 million. 
Remitly has relationships with top-tier banks and payments providers, including  Barclays  (LON:BARC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s retail bank, HSBC,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Visa (NYSE:V).
It plans to raise roughly $510.8 million by selling about 12.16 million shares priced between $38 per share and $42 per share, the filing showed https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782170/000162828021018524/remitlyglobalinc-sx1a1.htm.

1239,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Ark Drops Out of Top 10 ETF Issuers as ‘Shiny Object’ Lure Fades,"(Bloomberg) -- After vaulting up the ranks of the U.S. exchange-traded fund leaderboard, Ark Investment Management is starting to slip. 
With about $42.4 billion in its ETFs, Cathie Wood’s firm now ranks as the 11th largest issuer by assets, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. 
The money manager had cracked the top 10 earlier this year, buoyed by a torrent of inflows as investors flocked to Wood’s innovative vision. But competition is rising just as the shine comes off Ark’s flagship $21 billion ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK). 
As the firm’s assets have dipped slightly, rival WisdomTree has edged ahead. Meanwhile, industry newcomer Dimensional Fund Advisors is nipping at Ark’s heels, with less than $3 billion separating the two issuers after the quant giant’s latest mutual fund conversions. 
At the same time, ARKK has fallen over 5% this year -- after soaring nearly 150% in 2020 -- as the prospect of inflation and rising rates takes the shine off the kind of long-term tech bets favored by Wood. 
“Nobody’s running for the door, but the market hasn’t been supporting the core funds the way it was in 2020,” said Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at data provider ETF Trends. “Add to that the strong asset growth in ‘big cheap beta’ and huge moves like DFA converting funds, and the top of the leader board’s going to be in flux for a while.”
Wood and Ark’s ETFs beat most of the market in 2020, boosted by hefty allocations to electric-vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and other disruptive names. The outperformance came to an abrupt end this year when a spike in Treasury yields unseated many growth-centric stocks. 
While rates have declined in the months since, many of Ark’s previous high-flyers have yet to recover as inflationary fears remain.
To be sure, Ark funds are still sitting on $12.6 billion of inflows so far this year. It’s far too early to sound the death knell for the firm, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas. 
Wood’s entire ETF stable commanded around $15 billion a year ago. Assuming no mass exodus, it’s possible that “Ark mania” could reignite again should speculative technology stocks come back into vogue, he said. 
“While Ark mania may have died, Ark is alive and well at more than $40 billion, which is an astounding amount for an indie active issuer,” said Balchunas, an ETF analyst. “If they can hang tough during these tougher times, it bodes very well for when they go into ‘shiny object’ mode again.”

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:26AM ET</span>",Court hearing on Orcel's Santander job offer set for October 20,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) -A court hearing of a case brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel against Santander (MC:SAN) over the bank's withdrawal of an offer to make him CEO is expected to resume on October 20, a statement from the Madrid court said on Tuesday.
Santander and Orcel ended up in the Madrid court after Spain's largest bank dropped plans in January 2019 to make UBS investment banker Orcel its CEO after a dispute over his pay package.
Santander declined to comment, while Orcel's legal team was not immediately available. 
The proceedings were suspended in May after Orcel's lawyer asked UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Mark Shelton, head of performance and rewards at Switzerland's biggest bank, to testify. 
Because of issues over remote testimonies, Santander asked the Madrid court judge Javier Sanchez Beltran to send a so-called rogatory commission to Switzerland, a source said at the time.
On Tuesday a source from the Madrid court said once the rogatory commission had been processed Weber and Shelton would testify remotely from Switzerland.
The hearing would resume at 1000 local time on October 20.
The source said that Santander's general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales, who signed Orcel's original job offer, and Roberto di Bernardini, the Spanish bank's head of human resources at the time, would testify in person.

The case revolves around whether a four-page letter to Orcel constituted a binding contract or a non-binding initial offer.
In May, Santander boss Ana Botin defended in court the withdrawal of Orcel's multi-million euro offer.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Explainer-How China Evergrande's debt troubles pose a systemic risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group has raised fresh warnings of default risks amid late payments to wealth management and trust products.
The real estate giant has been scrambling to raise funds it needs to pay lenders and suppliers, with regulators and financial markets worried that any crisis could ripple through China's banking system and potentially trigger wider social unrest.
WHO IS EVERGRANDE? 
Founded in 1996 by Chairman Hui Ka Yan in the southern city of Guangzhou, Evergrande accelerated its growth in the past decade to become China's second-largest property developer with $110 billion in sales last year.
The company listed in Hong Kong in 2009, giving it more access to the capital and debt markets to grow its asset size to $355 billion today. It has more than 1,300 developments across the nation, many in lower-tier cities. 
With national sales growth slowing in recent years, Evergrande has also been branching into businesses unrelated to real estate, such as electric cars, football, insurance and bottled water.
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT PILE?
Investors became worried after a leaked letter in September showed Evergrande had pleaded for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor listing plan, warning it faced a cash crunch.
Concerns intensified after Evergrande admitted in June it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and news in July a Chinese court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm on the request of Guangfa Bank.
Evergrande's fast expansion over the years has been fuelled by debt. It has been aggressively raising loans to support its land buying spree, and selling apartments quickly despite low margins so as to start the cycle again. 
The firm's interim report said its interest-bearing debt totalled 571.8 billion yuan ($89 billion) at the end of June, compared with 716.5 billion at the end of 2020, as it stepped up deleveraging efforts.
Total liability, which include payables, however, increased slightly to 1.97 trillion yuan, accounting for around 2% of the country's GDP.
Other than the usual bank and bond channels, the developer has been criticised for tapping the less regulated shadow banking market, including trusts, wealth management products and commercial paper.
WHAT EVERGRANDE HAS DONE TO DELEVERAGE?
Evergrande accelerated its efforts to reduce its debts last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios dubbed ""the three red lines"" policy. It has said it aims to meet all the requirements by the end of next year. 
Evergrande has given buyers steep discounts for its residential developments and sold the bulk of its commercial properties to increase cashflow. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale, raising $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit in Hong Kong, while its EV unit sold a $3.4 billion stake to new investors. 
It unveiled plans earlier this year to spin off three unlisted units -- online real estate and automobile marketplace Fangchebao, and theme parks and spring water businesses -- to further release capital. Fangchebao has already raised $2.1 billion in a pre-IPO in March. 
On Tuesday, it said its asset and equity disposal plans to ease liquidity issues have failed to make material progress.
DOES EVERGRANDE POSE A RISK?
China's central bank highlighted in its financial stability report in 2018 that companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risks to the nation's financial system. 
Evergrande's liabilities involve more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions, according to the letter Evergrande sent to the government late last year. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated last week China Minsheng Bank has the highest exposure to Evergrande.
Late payments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions have exposure to Evergrande via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
In the dollar bond market, Evergrande accounts for 4% of Chinese real estate high-yields, according to DBS. Any defaults will also trigger sell-offs in the high-yield credit market.
A collapse of Evergrande will have a large impact on the job market. It has 200,000 staff and hires 3.8 million people every year for project developments. 
WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?
The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission summoned Evergrande's executives in August and warned that it needed to reduce its debt risks and prioritise stability.
Evergrande must ""actively diffuse debt risk and maintain real estate and financial markets stability,"" they said in a joint statement, and ""earnestly implement strategic arrangements made by the central government to ensure the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, and strive to keep operations stable"". 

Media reports said regulators have approved an Evergrande proposal to renegotiate payment deadlines with banks and other creditors. The Guangzhou government is also seeking opinions from Evergrande's major lenders about setting up a creditor committee.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Embattled Evergrande warns of growing default risks as pressures mount,"By Clare Jim and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Cash-strapped property group China Evergrande Group said on Tuesday it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of default risks amid plunging property sales, sending its stock and bond prices sharply lower.
The real estate giant has been scrambling to raise funds it needs to pay lenders and suppliers, with regulators and financial markets worried that any crisis could ripple through China's banking system and potentially trigger wider social unrest.
In the latest development, Evergrande said two of its subsidiaries had failed to uphold guarantee obligations for 934 million yuan ($145 million) worth of wealth management products issued by third parties.
That could ""lead to cross-default"", which would ""would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations,"" it said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, without providing further details on the products.
The company's shares slumped to a six-year low in Hong Kong on Tuesday and the Shanghai bourse halted trading of its listed bonds amid wild swings in its price.
Evergrande said it has appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers, the clearest indication yet that it is looking at restructuring options, analysts say.
The two firms will assess the group's capital structure, evaluate its liquidity, explore solutions to ease the current liquidity stress and reach an optimal solution for all stakeholders as soon as possible.
""Evergrande's announcement flags the first step of a restructuring, which usually involves either delay in interest payment, no interest payment or delay together with haircuts,"" said James Shi, distressed debt analyst at credit analytics provider Reorg. 
He added liquidation would only happen if the restructuring failed.
Evergrande late on Monday said online speculation about bankruptcy and restructuring was ""totally untrue"".
That came despite growing markets expectation that Evergrande may need to restructure, after China ruled in August that various lawsuits against the developer would be centrally handled in Guangzhou.
Evergrande said it is talking to potential investors to sell some of its assets, but has made no ""material progress"" so far.
The company said earlier this month that it was in talks to sell certain assets, including stakes in Hong Kong-listed units Evergrande New Energy Vehicle and Evergrande Property Services.
Pressure on Evergrande - which has 1.97 trillion yuan ($305 billion) in liabilities - has intensified in recent weeks as fears over its ability to repay investors triggered protests that are certain to rattle Beijing.
The company blamed ""ongoing negative media reports"" for dampening investor confidence, resulting in a further decline in sales in September.
WIDER IMPACT
Shares of the company fell over 10% on Tuesday morning to their lowest since December 2014. Its listed e-vehicle spinoff plunged over 23% and shares of its property management unit dropped 8%.
In the debt market, Evergrande's June 2025 dollar bonds fell nearly 6 cents on Tuesday late morning to 27 cents, yielding 58.45%, according to financial data provider Duration Finance.
Moves in the company's highly illiquid onshore bonds were more erratic, with one Shanghai exchange-traded bond surging nearly 23% and triggering a trading halt, while another in Shenzhen dived almost 12%.
Reorg's Shi said there may be fresh bond selling if Evergrande defaults, but the market spillover would be limited because the risks have mostly been largely priced in.
The bigger risks are likely to be social, he added.
Angry investors gathered near Evergrande's headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Monday to demand the firm repay loans and financial products.
The developer's struggles to quickly sell off assets and avert defaults on its massive liabilities are raising the risk of contagion for other privately-owned developers, fund managers and analysts say.
In a statement on Monday, it said it was facing ""unprecedented difficulties"" but would do everything possible to resume work and protect the legitimate rights and interests of its customers.

The company's debt has been repeatedly downgraded by ratings agencies targeting the developer over its struggles to restructure huge debts.

That represents about 17% of CenterPoint's power customers in the Houston area.
Nicholas was currently located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south-southwest of Houston and could cause life-threatening flash floods across the Deep South during the next couple of days, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Other utilities in Texas reported much fewer outages, counting around 60,000 customers without power so far. 
Separately, the South Texas nuclear plant, located near the Texas coast about 90 miles south of Houston, continued to operate at full power Tuesday morning, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
STP Nuclear Operating Co, which operates the South Texas nuclear plant, said late Monday that based on the weather forecasts at that time the company planned ""to operate through this tropical storm without a power reduction or shut down.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Zomato Ltd co-founder and head of supply Gaurav Gupta has left the Indian food delivery firm after six years, the company said https://www.zomato.com/blog/always-in-love-with-zomato on Tuesday, months after it went public in a high-profile listing.
Gupta, who was promoted to the position of founder in March 2019, had been instrumental in helping build Zomato's premium membership subscription and driving up sales in a competitive market.
His departure comes a day after local media reported https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/zomato-goes-leaner-as-after-grocery-it-shuts-down-nutraceutical-business-as-well-7458341.html that Zomato had shut its health and fitness products business just six months after launch at a time when the government was getting stringent about private label rules in India.
The company earlier this month laid off about 70 people from its sales team, according to a source who declined to be named as the matter was private.
Zomato did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The layoffs were the latest in a line of initiatives by the company to focus more on its mainstay food delivery business.
Zomato had also exited several of its international markets to focus solely on its India businesses in the build-up to its July market debut, in which its stock soared nearly 66%.
Zomato shares ended little changed on Tuesday after swinging wildly earlier in the session.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",Bolsonaro emerges as risk factor for Brazil IPO pipeline,"By Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Competition, the pandemic and sectoral demand are common challenges facing companies planning initial public offerings (IPOs), but Brazilian companies have started to flag a new risk: political upheaval from far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.
Cosmetics maker Coty (NYSE:COTY) and retailer Cencosud's Brazilian units included the risk of a presidential impeachment in their recent offering prospectuses, while Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's distributor Solar Bebidas SA cautioned about turmoil ahead of the 2022 presidential elections.
Bolsonaro's recent confrontation with Brazil's Supreme Court amid an economic crisis has raised fears over the country's reform process and threatens to poison the environment for 25 IPOs-in-waiting, which - added to this year's 44 listings so far - would break Brazil's record for IPOs.
Last week, Bolsonaro toned down his fight with the country's top court, which authorized probes of him and his allies based on allegations that they had attacked Brazil's democratic institution. 
But market participants still question how long the truce will last. The Bovespa benchmark is down 2.9% this year in U.S. dollar terms, one of just five global indexes in negative territory for the year. 
""The outlook for IPOs is more challenging. A potential institutional crisis may reduce chances of approval of reforms needed to boost the economy's growth"", said Gustavo Miranda, investment banking head at  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA.
Even before the pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations on Sep. 7, IPOs were facing a bumpier time amid sluggish growth, high unemployment and a severe drought pressuring food and energy prices. 
Cement maker Intercement Brasil decided to cancel its share offering in July as investors offered lower valuations, while aluminum producer Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, among others, had to slash their offer prices to sell their shares. 
""We have been advising companies that are planning an IPO to be ready in case market conditions recover over the coming weeks,"" said Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Itau BBA, ruling out a complete shutdown of markets for share offerings.
So far this month the only two companies that are braving the market to try to conclude IPOs are gym chain BlueFit and pharma company Althaia, both slated to price next week.
MAGNIFYING GLASS
Poor performance among IPOs is also depressing investors' appetite for new transactions, said Marcelo Millen, head of equities capital markets at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in Brazil. Nearly half of the companies listed over the last two months are trading below their IPO prices.
Asset managers, facing a paucity of new money to invest in additional shares, have grown especially picky. Stock and hedge funds had net outflows in September, although most still show inflows for the year. 

""We are looking at new IPOs with a magnifying glass because we expect more volatility as the 2022 elections approach,"" said Sara Delfim, managing partner at asset management firm Dahlia Capital, adding that some sectors may be able to bypass the current turbulence.
Brazilian companies considering IPOs in the United States such as fintech Nubank, payments company Conductor and Hotmart, a platform for content creators may buck the election volatility, as their growth is less reliant on the macro environment.

1249,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 06:57AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Largely Unchanged; CPI Data in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged, with investors cautiously awaiting the release of key U.S. inflation data, looking for clues about the monetary policy outlook.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 15 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed just 1 point, less than 0.1%.
The release of August consumer price inflation, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), is the highlight of the day’s economic calendar, with inflation seen as a key factor influencing the Federal Reserve's choice of when to scale back its monetary stimulus.
August consumer prices are expected to have risen by 5.3% year-on-year, a slight slowdown from July’s spike of 5.4%, which matched the largest jump since August 2008. This release could set the tone for markets ahead of next week’s Fed meeting, particularly if the rise is larger than expected.
The broad-based S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher on Monday, for the first time in six sessions, helped by the news that the 7-day average of Covid-19 cases dropped to 136,000 through Friday, down from 157,000 new cases at the end of August.
That said, despite those gains, investors are turning bearish on the global economy, according to Bank of America’s monthly fund manager survey for September. 
Economic growth expectations are now at a net 13%, the lowest since April 2020 and markedly down from a 91% peak in March this year, with the spread of the delta variant pf Covid-19 cited as the main reason for the increase in pessimism.
In corporate news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be in the spotlight Tuesday, with the world’s largest company expected to announce new versions of the iPhone, the Apple Watch and Airpods. 
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will also be in focus as the software company’s first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations after the close Monday, hurt by competition in the Cloud computing space.
Crude prices pushed higher Tuesday, extending recent gains as another storm threatened output from the important Gulf of Mexico region, an area still trying to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida only two weeks ago.
The offshore oil platforms were evacuated on Monday as Tropical Storm Nicholas strengthened into a hurricane, prompting President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency for Louisiana. 
Sentiment was also underpinned by the International Energy Agency’s monthly report predicting a robust rebound in the fourth quarter, while the American Petroleum Institute inventories are due at 4:30 PM ET.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $70.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $73.98. Both benchmarks were near their highest levels since early August hit the previous day.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,787.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1801.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",S.Korea fines Google $177 million for blocking Android customisation,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's antitrust regulator has fined Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google 207 billion won ($176.64 million) for blocking customised versions of its Android operating system (OS), in the U.S. technology giant's second setback in the country in less than a month.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said on Tuesday Google's contract terms with device makers amounted to an abuse of its dominant market position that restricted competition in the mobile OS market.
Google said in a statement it intends to appeal the ruling, saying it ignores the benefits offered by Android's compatibility with other programs and undermines advantages enjoyed by consumers.
""The Korea Fair Trade Commission's decision is meaningful in a way that it provides an opportunity to restore future competitive pressure in the mobile OS and app market markets,"" KFTC Chairperson Joh Sung-wook said in a statement.
The antitrust regulator said this could be the ninth-biggest fine it has ever imposed.
KFTC said Google hampered competition by making device producers abide by an ""anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)"" when signing key contracts with it regarding app store licences.
Under the AFA, manufacturers could not equip their handsets with modified versions of Android, known as ""Android forks"". That has helped Google cement its market dominance in the mobile OS market, the KFTC said.
Under the ruling, Google is banned from forcing device makers to sign AFA contracts, allowing manufacturers to adopt modified versions of Android OS on their devices. 
In one instance, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd launched a smartwatch with a customised OS in 2013 but switched to a different OS after Google regarded the move as an AFA violation, KFTC said. Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics declined to comment.
The fine comes on the day that an amendment to South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act - popularly dubbed the ""anti-Google law"" - came into effect.
The bill was passed in late August and it bans app store operators such as Google from requiring software developers to use their payment systems. The requirement had effectively stopped developers from charging commission on in-app purchases.

Last year, India's antitrust body ordered an investigation into allegations that Google was abusing its market position to promote its payments app as well as forcing app developers to use its in-app payment system.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded 0.3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket ahead of the company’s biggest launch event of the year.
The world’s largest company is expected to today announce new versions of the iPhone, the Apple Watch and Airpods. Media reports have ruled out major updates to the iPhone while improvements to cameras and batteries are expected. True to its past form, the company is unlikely to talk about any product still in its pipeline - including the oft-rumored car project.
A report in The Wall Street Journal earlier had said the company is working on new health-related features for its smartwatch, including a tool to tell users when their blood pressure is increasing. The Apple watch could also host a thermometer to help with fertility planning, the report said.
The company could use a lift after two setbacks in quick succession. It confirmed on Monday that the iPhone's much-touted security had been breached by a hack exploiting weaknesses in its iMessage app. Citizen Lab, an academic research group said that Israel-based NSO Group used the messaging software to “exploit and infect” the company's latest devices with spyware.
The flaw allowed a hacker using NSO’s Pegasus malware to gain access to a device owned by an unnamed Saudi activist, according to security researchers. Apple said the flaw could be exploited if a user on a vulnerable device received a “maliciously crafted” PDF file.
That news came only days after a court ruling that weakened Apple's defense of its monopoly on payments within its app store. While the company doesn't break out its payments revenue, analysts estimate it at aroundf $18 billion in its last fiscal year.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>",Factbox - Universal to list as music streaming picks up,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), the French media conglomerate, is spinning off Universal Music Group, the largest part of its business and the label behind singers such as Taylor Swift, in a listing on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam. 
Here are facts about Universal and its flotation: 
FROM THE BEATLES TO BILLIE EILISH
By revenue, Universal Music Group or UMG is the largest of the ""big three"" record labels. It represents a huge range of musicians and song catalogs, from Billie Eilish to The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. 
Major competitors include  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music, part of Sony, and Warner Music Group. The ""big three"" are estimated to account for just under 60% of global sales generated by music rights from their catalogs. 
Universal started out in the early 1930s when British label Decca Records set up a U.S. branch, which later merged with other music companies. In 2011 Universal swooped on EMI's recorded music business for $1.9 billion, giving it access to catalogs for The Beatles, Radiohead and Pink Floyd. 
A SHIFTING MUSIC INDUSTRY
Universal is benefiting from a boom in streaming revenues, with young music fans in particular relying on their smartphones to listen to songs. It makes money from subscription services through deals with the likes of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
It also has deals in place with ad-based social media companies such as TikTok and YouTube to compensate artists for the use of their songs in ""user-generated content"" on those platforms - though the terms of those deals are not public.
While digital piracy cut into music sales in the first decade of the century, it is now pushing into areas such as social media platforms which use its music, such as TikTok, as well as fitness applications and video games. 
Universal still faces competition from independent labels and start-ups looking to release music in a purely digital fashion. The company said in its listing prospectus that it expected to grow its streaming business in markets such as South Korea, Brazil, India and Russia. 
THE LISTING 
Vivendi's investors, including its controlling shareholder Vincent Bollore, are due to receive 60% of the shares of the company once Universal lists in Amsterdam, with trading due to start on Sept. 21. 
The company is aiming for a market capitalisation of 33 billion euros ($39 billion). No new shares are being issued. 
Vivendi will continue to hold 10% of Universal after the transaction. A consortium led by China's Tencent will have 20% and billionaire hedge fund investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings will hold 10%. 
Bollore and Tencent have agreed to consult each other on matters such as dividend policy and some aspects of the board ahead of general meetings, Universal said in its prospectus. 
REVENUES AND COVID-19 IMPACT
Universal reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.49 billion euros on sales of 7.43 billion euros in 2020. The company has 2 billion euros of net debt.
For the mid-term, Universal forecasts sales growth in the high single digits, with an EBITDA margin in the mid 20% range.

Universal said in its prospectus that the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit some streaming revenues, including when people told to stay at home stopped listening to music at the gym or on long commutes. Universal said this had now normalised and picked up again, with sales of merchandising that are often done at concerts the main pain point.

Investing.com – Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) fell nearly 2% in Tuesday’s premarket trading after the software company’s first-quarter revenue came in below estimates.
The shock for the company came from its Cloud license and on-premise license business where revenue fell 8% to $813 million.
Total quarterly revenue was up 4% on-year to $9.7 billion, just shy of expectations but a sharp drop from the previous quarter and its lowest number in a year. Analysts noted the pace and scale of client acquisitions wasn't enough to support revenue growth expectations over 10%. 
The company pointed out, however, that Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn),  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and Telefonica Brasil (NYSE:VIV) all signed up for its Cloud infrastructure business in the recent quarter.
The Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 32 cents per share. Earnings per share of $1.03 beat expectations slightly. Oracle said earnings will be around $1.11 in the current quarter, while revenue is projected at $10.19 billion at the center of the range, which would equate to only 1% year-on-year growth.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>",France's Bollore poised to own $7 billion worth of Universal after listing,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Toby Sterling and Abhinav Ramnarayan
PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Vincent Bollore is set to own $7 billion worth of Universal Music Group shares after it floats next week, raising questions about how the French tycoon could use this new source of cash as Universal's parent Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) charts a new course.
Bollore, the top investor in Vivendi who spearheaded the spin-off of the world's biggest music label with artists such as Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones, is set to be one of the deal's biggest winners, the prospectus issued on Tuesday showed.
Listing Universal, with an estimated equity value of 33 billion euros ($39 billion), involves distributing 60% of its shares to Vivendi's shareholders. Bollore is set to receive about 18%, worth about 5.9 billion euros ($7 billion).
""The question next is what he will do with his share,"" a source familiar with the transaction said. ""The cash that he will get from this, he could deploy it in some other way.""
Universal's listing, Europe's biggest so far this year, drew international attention after Vivendi sold 20% of the division to a group led by Chinese tech giant Tencent and 10% to U.S. billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square. 
Vivendi, now part of Bollore's family-run empire, has invested in a range of companies, including media and publishing group Lagardere and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
Separating Universal from Vivendi will deprive the Paris-based group of its most valuable asset and is likely to pushed down the share price of it parent after the spin-off.
The media group expects its shares to trade at a lower price after Universal's shares start trading on Sept. 21 on Euronext's Amsterdam stock exchange, Universal said in the prospectus. 
For Bollore and Vivendi, Universal's spin-off aims to extract the most value from its prized asset as streaming revenues help the music industry rebound from a downturn.
Universal, whose other hit singers include Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, sees itself as indispensable for artists seeking to collect royalties in far-flung places and on social media, an impossible task even for major stars, let alone smaller ones.
In the 2000s, artists and record labels lost sales to piracy of digital music and a shrinking market for physical media such as CDs. Their fortunes turned in the mid-2010s as subscription services led by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) helped restore royalty revenue.
In addition, the explosion of music on ad-supported social media platforms such as YouTube and TikTok has started to benefit record labels as they strike deals for a share of ad revenue on ""user-generated"" content that includes music clips.

Universal has registered six consecutive years of sales growth, reporting 1.49 billion euros in core earnings in 2020 on 7.43 billion euros in sales.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp on Tuesday launched a $3 billion fund to invest in technology companies in Latin America in a bid to build on the success of its initial fund for the region, which has spent most of its capital. 
In a statement, the Japanese conglomerate said it plans to invest in listed and private tech companies, adding the fund may raise additional capital in the future.
SoftBank's renewed bet on Latin America comes as venture capital is booming in countries such as Brazil and Mexico, and follows a decision to pause new investments in China https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/japans-softbank-reports-39-fall-q1-net-profit-2021-08-10 after a regulatory crackdown on tech companies.
""There is so much innovation and disruption taking place in Latin America, and I believe the business opportunities there have never been stronger,"" SoftBank Group's chairman Masayoshi Son said in the statement. ""Latin America is a critical part of our strategy.""
SoftBank's first $5 billion Latin American fund was launched in 2019 by executive vice-president and Chief Operations Officer Marcelo Claure at a time when no deep-pocketed investor had signed big checks for startups in the region. 
It has invested $3.5 billion in 48 companies from sectors ranging from education to finance and logistics, which are now valued at $6.9 billion.
Most of its portfolio companies remain private. 

Still, companies such as Banco Inter SA, which SoftBank bought into when it was already listed, and e-commerce software platform VTEX, which went public in July, helped the fund post gains in the last quarter.
COO Claure, who will oversee the new fund, said returns from the initial fund have exceeded SoftBank's expectations.

LONDON (Reuters) -Barely a tenth of respondents in a monthly fund manager survey expect a stronger global economy in the coming months, marking the lowest proportion since last April's initial COVID-19 panic, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s (BofA's) September edition of the survey showed.
Economic growth expectations are now at a net 13%, the lowest since April 2020 and markedly down from a 91% peak in March this year. The spread of the Delta variant was cited as the reason for the pessimism, the popular monthly survey said.
Despite the growing caution on the macroeconomic outlook, positioning in asset markets remains overwhelmingly bullish. 
Equity market protection designed to shield portfolios against a sharp drop in asset values was at the lowest levels since January 2008.
Nearly half of BofA's clients, with $840 billion in assets under management, said they have removed protection against a sharp fall in equity prices over the next three months, the lowest figure since January 2018.
Moreover, broader equity market positioning remains firmly bullish with net global equity allocations at 50%, far above a 20-year average of 29%, the survey said.
""A rare disconnect is growing between asset prices and fundamentals,"" a team of strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients.
The broader market outlook remains one of greater caution with survey respondents expecting central banks to remain dovish.
Eighty four percent of investors now expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to start reeling in its stimulus measures by the end of the year, though expectations for the first U.S. rate hike were pushed out to February 2023 from November 2022 previously.

Moreover, 82% of respondents expect China to ease policy, up from 44% in July.
Global liquidity conditions were widely seen as the best since just before the global financial crisis hit world markets in July 2007. Almost 60% of respondents in the survey said monetary policy was ""too simulative"" which was the highest proportion since May 2011.

CNH Industrial said in 2019 it planned to split in two and separately list its lower-margin Iveco truck and bus units along with its FPT engine division to boost asset values and streamline its businesses.
The assets included in the spin-off plan - initially referred to as the CNH Industrial's ""OnHighway"" business - have now been renamed Iveco Group, which will start as an independent company in early 2022, CNH said in a statement.

Tanzi will join Iveco Group on Jan. 1 after stepping down from his role as CFO at tyre manufacturer Pirelli, a position he has held for the past 12 years. 
Earlier this year CNH Industrial, which is controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, nominated its president for commercial and speciality vehicles unit Gerrit Marx as chief executive of the new Iveco group.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) named Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, a former chief executive of RWE Renewables, to oversee the British company's rapid expansion into renewable energy following the unexpected departure of BP's head of low carbon and natural gas Dev Sanyal.
Dotzenrath's appointment comes at a time when BP, under the leadership of CEO Bernard Looney, seeks to rapidly grow its renewables business and shift away from oil. 
Dotzenrath is an electrical engineer with more than 25 years of senior experience in energy. She helped RWE Renewables develop into one of the world's largest renewable power companies and the second largest offshore wind player globally.
Sanyal, who joined BP 32 years ago, will now become the chief executive of European refiner Varo Energy, owned by  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and Vitol, where he will expand the focus on low carbon energy, the company said in a separate statement.
""By choosing an executive vice president to lead the gas & low carbon energy business with a renewable energy track record and no oil & gas experience, BP confirms its ambitions in renewable energy while showing that it sees a smaller role in the natural gas part of the business going forward,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Giacomo Romeo said in a note.
Sanyal's departure comes 19 months after Bernard Looney took over as BP CEO with an ambitious strategy to turn the oil and gas company into a major renewables and power company.
Sanyal was among three executives shortlisted to succeed former CEO Bob Dudley along with Looney and former chief financial officer Brian Gilvary, company sources previously told Reuters. 
In July 2020, Sanyal was appointed as head of natural gas and low carbon as part of a major company overhaul. He will hand over his responsibilities in the fourth quarter of 2021, BP said.

The British and Indian national oversaw major investments in recent months, including in U.S. and British offshore wind projects.
He had previously headed BP's alternative energy business where he oversaw BP's acquisition of a 43% stake in Lightsource BP, a major solar company.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded lower Tuesday, with investors showing caution ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation figures later in the session and amid worries over future growth.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%.
The release of the latest U.S. consumer prices, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), is keeping investors cautious Tuesday, as this is seen as being a key factor in determining when the Federal Reserve chooses to scale back its economic stimulus.
Annual inflation is expected to have eased slightly to 4.2% from 4.3% in July, and this data comes shortly before the Federal Reserve’s next meeting, on Sept 21-22.
The European Central Bank decided last week to slow down its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, citing higher inflation, and ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel said on Monday that the region’s central bank is ready to act if inflation does not ease as soon as next year.
In corporate news, Pandora (OTC:PANDY) stock rose 3.5% after the jewellery maker said it aims to achieve sales growth between 6.0% and 8.0% over the coming years.
BP (NYSE:BP) stock fell 0.3% after the energy giant confirmed that its renewables boss Dev Sanyal will leave the energy company at the end of the year, a surprise as BP seeks to grow its renewables business and shift away from oil.
Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock fell 2.7% after the online supermarket’s third quarter results were hit by higher costs associated with hiring additional drivers as well as a fire at its fulfillment center. 
Also of note, the U.K. claimant count fell by 58,600 in August, a substantial improvement from the 7,800 drop the previous month, although the unemployment rate remained at 4.6%. 
Crude prices pushed higher Tuesday, extending recent gains as another storm threatened the output from the important U.S. Gulf of Mexico region, an area still trying to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida only two weeks ago.
The offshore oil platforms were evacuated on Monday as Tropical Storm Nicholas strengthened into a hurricane, prompting President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency for Louisiana. 
More than 40% of the U.S. Gulf's oil and gas output was still offline even before Nicholas’s arrival, according to offshore regulator Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $71.03 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $74.10. Both benchmarks were near their highest levels since early August hit the previous day.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Pandeconomics part 2,"A look at the day ahead from Julien Ponthus. 
Slowly but surely, global policymakers are entering a new phase of their economic response to the pandemic. 
The rise in inflation, for one, may persuade central banks to speed up their stimulus exit plans. 
U.S. consumers' expectations for inflation are at the highest since 2013 while a market gauge of future euro zone inflation has risen to mid-2015 highs.
The ECB has already decided to slow, at least temporarily, the pace of bond-buying while in the United States, the question is how soon the Federal will announce stimulus tapering plans. U.S. annual inflation data, due later in the day and forecast at 4.2%, may show the way.
Even Australia, where inflation is far below target, has not blinked while proceeding with bond-buying plans 
Nor is fiscal tightening out of the question in the policy guide book. Britain is at the vanguard of announcing tax hikes to restore public finances while U.S. Democrats are mulling a rollback of Trump-era tax cuts that benefited wealthy companies and individuals.
Market impact? A U.S. corporate tax increase to 25% and the passage of about half of a proposed increase to tax rates on foreign income, reduce S&P 500 earnings by 5% in 2022, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates.
Meanwhile, the competition landscape which allowed tech giants to thrive in the last decade is also shifting. 
On Friday, a U.S. judge stopped short of labelling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) an ""illegal monopolist"", while a Dutch court's ruling that Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers are employees follows a similar judgement in Britain.
China too continues to clobber its tech firms, telling them to end their practice of blocking each other's links on their sites.

(Reuters) -A cyber surveillance company based in Israel developed a tool to break into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones with a never-before-seen technique that has been in use since at least February, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday.
The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which requires no user interaction and affects all versions of Apple's iOS, OSX, and watchOS, except for those updated on Monday.
The tool developed by the Israeli firm, named NSO Group, defeats security systems designed by Apple in recent years. 
Apple said it fixed the vulnerability in Monday's software update, confirming Citizen Lab's finding. https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild 
""After identifying the vulnerability used by this exploit for iMessage, Apple rapidly developed and deployed a fix in iOS 14.8 to protect our users,"" said Ivan Krstić, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, in a statement. ""Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals."" 
""While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data,"" he added. 
An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on whether the hacking technique came from NSO Group. 
In a statement to Reuters, NSO did not confirm or deny that it was behind the technique, saying only that it would ""continue to provide intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world with life-saving technologies to fight terror and crime.""
'SOFT UNDERBELLY OF DEVICE SECURITY' 
Citizen Lab said it found the malware on the phone of an unnamed Saudi activist and that the phone had been infected with spyware in February. It is unknown how many other users may have been infected.
The intended targets would not have to click on anything for the attack to work. Researchers said they did not believe there would be any visible indication that a hack had occurred.
The vulnerability lies in how iMessage automatically renders images. IMessage has been repeatedly targeted by NSO and other cyber arms dealers, prompting Apple to update its architecture. But that upgrade has not fully protected the system.
""Popular chat apps are at risk of becoming the soft underbelly of device security. Securing them should be top priority,"" said Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had no immediate comment.
Citizen Lab said multiple details in the malware overlapped with prior attacks by NSO, including some that were never publicly reported. One process within the hack's code was named ""setframed,"" the same name given in a 2020 infection of a device used by a journalist at Al Jazeera, the researchers found. 
""The security of devices is increasingly challenged by attackers,"" said Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak. 
A record number of previously unknown attack methods, which can be sold for $1 million or more, have been revealed this year. The attacks are labeled ""zero-day"" because software companies had zero days' notice of the problem.
Along with a surge in ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure, the explosion in such attacks has stoked a new focus on cybersecurity in the White House as well as renewed calls for regulation and international agreements to rein in malicious hacking. 

The FBI has been investigating NSO, and Israel has set up a senior inter-ministerial team to assess allegations that its spyware has been abused on a global scale.
Although NSO has said it vets the governments it sells to, its Pegasus spyware has been found on the phones of activists, journalists and opposition politicians in countries with poor human rights records.

Morrisons is at the centre of a bid battle between two U.S. private equity firms. 
The supermarket group agreed a 7 billion pound offer from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) in August, but a rival consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group could still trump the bid and the battle looks to be heading for an auction.

Chairman of the Trustees, Steve Southern, said that under CD&R, the outcome for Morrisons pensioners would be positive.

1267,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Caution Ahead of U.S. CPI Release,"By Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to open lower Tuesday, with investors showing caution ahead of the release of key U.S. inflation figures later in the session.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.5%.
The timing of when central banks choose to scale back economic stimulus is a key driver of market sentiment, nowhere more so than in the U.S., the world’s largest economy and major growth driver.
One of the key factors in potentially determining the reining in of the extraordinary stimulus is soaring inflation, with U.S. producer prices having jumped 8.3% on an annual basis in August. Eyes will turn to the release of the latest U.S. consumer prices, with annual inflation expected to have eased slightly to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. The data comes ahead of a key meeting by the Federal Reserve on Sept 21-22.
The European Central Bank decided last week to slow down its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, citing higher inflation, and ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel said on Monday that the region’s central bank is ready to act if inflation does not ease as soon as next year.
Also of note, the U.K. claimant count fell by 58,600 in August, a substantial improvement from the 7,800 drop the previous month, although the unemployment rate remained at 4.6%. 
In corporate news, retailer JD Sports (NASDAQ:JD) (LON:JD) reported interim results, while online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) released a trading statement. However, most eyes will be on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL latest virtual product launch later Tuesday, amid heightened anticipation of what the iPhone maker will offer up. 
Crude prices pushed higher Tuesday, extending recent gains as another storm threatened the output from the important U.S. Gulf of Mexico region, an area still trying to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida only two weeks ago.
The offshore oil platforms were evacuated on Monday as Tropical Storm Nicholas strengthened into a hurricane, prompting President Joe Biden to declare a state of emergency for Louisiana. 
More than 40% of the U.S. Gulf's oil and gas output was still offline even before Nicholas’s arrival, according to offshore regulator Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $70.98 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $74.03. Both benchmarks were near their highest levels since early August hit the previous day.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,793.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded largely flat at 1.1809.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) will transfer a smaller-than-expected $3.9 billion in oil and gas decommissioning liabilities to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) when it merges its petroleum business with the independent Australian gas producer.
Woodside's shares jumped 6.5% after the figure was disclosed in BHP's annual report on Tuesday, outperforming gains of around 4% among its peers.
""The long awaited BHPP (BHP Petroleum) abandonment provision number has been released, coming in below what we feared it could be,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Saul Kavonic said in a note.
BHP said in its annual report that as of June 2021, its petroleum assets included ""property plant and equipment and closure and rehabilitation provisions of approximately $11.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively"".
When the merger was announced in August, investors had raised concerns as Woodside declined to reveal the rehabilitation liabilities that were assumed in setting the deal terms with BHP's petroleum business to create a global top-10 independent oil and gas company.
The oil and gas rehabilitation provisions, which are estimates of the cost of removing platforms and pipelines and cleaning up sites at the end of their lives, make up about one-third of BHP's total closure and rehabilitation provisions of $11.9 billion for all its assets.
Kavonic said he had assumed Woodside might inherit as much as $5 billion to $7 billion in decommissioning liabilities in the merger with BHP's petroleum arm, which comprises assets in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Algeria.

Citi had estimated BHP's decommissioning liabilities in Australia's Bass Strait alone at $3.4 billion.
Once tax offsets are taken into account, the actual decommissioning cost may be below $1 billion, Kavonic said, adding that those costs could be deferred through reusing sites for activities such as carbon capture and storage or offshore wind in the future.

1269,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:36PM ET</span>",Nikkei 225 Set for Highest Close Since 1990 as Japan Stocks Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese stocks advanced for a third day, lifting the Nikkei 225 Stock Average toward levels last seen during the nation’s bubble economy more than three decades ago.
Fanuc (OTC:FANUY) Corp. and KDDI (OTC:KDDIF) Corp. were the largest contributors to a gain of as much as 1.1% in the Nikkei 225 during morning trading in Tokyo. The blue-chip gauge rose to as high as 30,795.78, surpassing this year’s previous peak in February, before paring much of those gains. Electronics makers gave the biggest boost to the broader Topix, which advanced as much as 0.9%. 
Japan has been the world’s best-performing major stock market over the past two weeks amid hopes for new leadership, an acceleration of vaccinations and a reshuffle in the Nikkei 225 to include heavyweights  Nintendo Co  (OTC:NTDOY)., Keyence (OTC:KYCCF) Corp. and Murata Manufacturing Co (OTC:MRAAY). Crucially, foreign money is returning, with JPMorgan, Baillie Gifford and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management among investors who say they’re becoming more positive on Japan.
“Global allocations to Japanese equities remain limited, suggesting room for investors to add exposure,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists including Christian Mueller-Glissmann wrote in a note. “The rebound in Japanese equities comes after a prolonged underperformance vs. the S&P 500 and other major indices since Q2.”
Hideyuki Ishiguro, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management Co. in Tokyo, said Japan’s progress against the pandemic has been supportive for the market. On Monday, the government reported that 50.9% of the population has received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.
“Japan’s vaccination rate has topped 50% and is on a similar level to that of the U.S.,” he said. “Japanese equities had been showing unstable performance relative to U.S. and European equities because of political uncertainties and a delayed vaccination process but with the two factors having been resolved, investors’ moves to unwind their previous positions will continue.”
The Nikkei 225 is now up about 12% for the year, with the Topix up 17%. That compares with a 19% gain for the S&P 500 Index and 17% advance for the STOXX Europe 600 Index.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists led by Marko Kolanovic advise adding to Japanese stocks. The resignation of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga paves the way for a stable ruling party, a scenario that the firm says has historically produced better equity returns, they wrote in a client note. Taro Kono, a popular candidate among foreign investors, is the favorite among the public to replace Suga as the leader of the ruling party, according to a poll by Nikkei and TV Tokyo. 
Foreign investors bought a net 662.7 billion yen ($6 billion) worth of Japanese equities and futures in the week through Sept. 3, the day news unexpectedly broke that Suga would not seek for another term as LDP leader. It was the most in a single week since February.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:05PM ET</span>","Stop funding coal abroad, NGO group tells top investor Bank of China","By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Bank of China (BoC), a top global investor in coal- power plants, must end the financing of such projects outside the mainland and support clean and renewable energy instead, an alliance of 35 non-governmental organisations said on Tuesday.
The comments, made in an open letter to state-controlled BoC's chairman Liu Liange and signed by groups from 13 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, add to the growing criticism of China for financing coal-fired power stations overseas, especially as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.
While China has said that it would respect the right of local communities to decide what sort of energy they needed, the letter, which has been signed by organisations from several Belt and Road countries, indicates growing opposition to coal even in developing nations. 
Bank of China's total overseas financing of coal-based power projects since the Paris climate agreement in 2015 stands at more than $35 billion, the most by any investor globally, and is ""out of step with China's climate change ambition"", the letter said. 
It said more than 130 financial institutions have already decided to restrict fossil fuel investments, and urged Bank of China to follow suit.
Bank of China declined to comment on the letter. Its President Liu Jin said at the end of August that the bank would ""gradually reduce"" the share of total credit extended to coal projects during the 2021-2025 period, but would also issue more loans for technical upgrades in the sector.
GRADUAL SHIFT
Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces, an Australian organisation that campaigns against fossil fuel finance, said dozens of coal-fired power plants around the world would not go ahead without the bank's support.
""The narrative on coal from Chinese business and finance leaders is clearly shifting, but what really counts is action,"" he told Reuters.
Chinese financial institutions have been gradually shifting away from coal. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest bank by assets, has already pledged to draw up a ""road map"" to pull out of coal.
In recommendations published last week, a government advisory body also called on China to ""restrict and gradually stop"" the use of public funds in overseas coal power investment, and encourage state banks to make similar commitments.

According to research released on Tuesday by European think-tank E3G, 44 countries have already committed to ""no new coal"", with 1,175 gigawatts of coal-power capacity cancelled since 2015. 
It said a similar pledge by China would remove 55% of all of the world's proposed new coal-fired power projects.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets edged higher on Monday as gains on Wall Street and European indexes pushed aside - for now - fears over inflation, regulation and higher corporate taxes. 
Investors' focus now shifts to Tuesday's U.S. consumer price data, which will give a broad picture of the country's economic recovery ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05%, and the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.29%. 
The S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, ending a five-day losing streak, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average also ending the day higher, up 0.76%. The NASDAQ slipped less than 0.1%.
The dollar climbed to a two-week peak, and oil prices topped 6-week highs.
""European and U.S. equity markets largely shrugged off rising concerns about regulatory dominance in Chinese tech stocks, as focus turns towards US CPI for August,"" ANZ Research analysts wrote. 
U.S. government bond yields dipped on Monday. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 1.8 basis points at 1.323%.
Asian stocks fell earlier in the day following news of a fresh regulatory crackdown on Chinese firms. 
China fired another regulatory shot at its tech giants, telling them to end a long-standing practice of blocking each other's links on their websites. The Financial Times also reported that China is aiming to break up the payments app Alipay. 
The Chinese blue-chip index fell 0.5% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.78% lower. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.22%.
Leading U.S. House of Representatives Democrats said they are seeking to raise the tax rate on corporations to 26.5%, up from the current 21%.
The core reading of the U.S. consumer price index is expected to show a rise of 0.3% in August, down from 0.5% the previous month and 0.9% in June.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is paying close attention to price pressures as it mulls when to begin to reduce its massive bond holdings and how soon to begin lifting rates from near zero. It also remains on the lookout for any signs that price pressures may broaden.
The general air of risk aversion helped lift the dollar index to 92.69, up 0.12%.
Oil prices rose to six-week highs as U.S. output remains slow to return two weeks after Hurricane Ida slammed into the Gulf Coast and worries another storm could affect output in Texas this week.

Brent crude settled up $0.59, or up 0.81%, at $73.51 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up $0.73, or up 1.05%, at $70.45 per barrel.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, which distributes  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 shots in Japan, expects vaccines to become a bigger part of its portfolio as shots for dengue fever and COVID-19 near regulatory approval, its chief executive said.
Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker and among the top 10 globally after its 2019 takeover of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP), has traditionally been known more for its cancer and gastrointestinal treatments.
But vaccines have defined much of the company's activities during the coronavirus pandemic, as it worked to bring foreign-developed shots into Japan.
Vaccine production is a business that ""when established, has a very long life,"" Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said in an interview broadcast at Reuters Events' Pharma Japan 2021 conference on Tuesday.
""There is no generic of vaccines, for example. So it's a different type of lifecycle, but it can be a very good business if you bring innovation,"" he added.
Takeda's dengue fever vaccine was submitted to European regulators in March, and the company said it planned to file for approval in several South American and Asian countries this year. Takeda has been working for almost 10 years on the shot, which is now in the ""last stage,"" Weber said.
The company has imported some 50 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine into Japan and has a license to manufacture  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc's vaccine, which is still undergoing trials.
Japan's government has agreed to buy another 50 million Moderna shots, to be delivered next year, along with 150 million Novavax doses.
About 1.6 million Moderna doses were recalled in Japan this month after the discovery of small metal contaminants in some vials, a problem traced back to a production line in Spain.
Weber said such problems sometimes occur in pharma manufacturing, brushing off the suggestion it was caused by companies rushing to bring vaccines to market.

With some of its main sellers due to lose patent protection in the coming years, Takeda is betting heavily on a pipeline of more than 10 drugs in late-stage development. One of those, a blood cancer treatment known as Pevonedistat, fell out of the running this month after poor trial results.
""We don't rely on one product in our pipeline, or two, when we have 40 in clinical stage,"" Weber said.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:50PM ET</span>","Barrick eyes new mines, not deals, for future growth","By Ernest Scheyder
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) Corp Chief Executive Mark Bristow spent years burnishing his reputation as an aggressive dealmaker, but he says now he is focused on new mines that he hopes will boost profit and the company's sagging stock price.
The strategy eschews the acquisition appetite that made Barrick what it is today and instead pins the company's growth on exploration projects in Egypt, Nevada, Guyana and elsewhere. 
""The very foundation of our future has to be our geologists and where we are investing,"" Bristow told Reuters on the sidelines of the MINExpo conference in Las Vegas, the quadrennial gathering of industry executives and suppliers. ""Organic growth is always a winner when it comes to value.""
Barrick's shares have lagged rival Newmont Corp and the S&P 500 this year, putting pressure on Bristow and his management team. But Bristow said that by funding exploration, rather than striking deals, Barrick's costs should drop over time, boosting revenue.
""We've got to balance the short-term-ism that fund managers want ... with the fact that we are investing capital for the long term,"" he said. ""You've got to be patient.""
Bristow, 62, has long implored his fellow CEOs to buy each other. Last autumn, he called for industry consolidation as the best way to avert a ""serious reserve crisis"" looming for the sector. 
He formed the existing Barrick when it bought his Africa-focused  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) in 2019. A few months later, Bristow made an $18 billion hostile bid for Newmont, a deal that eventually fizzled but not before both companies formed a Nevada joint venture.
Integrating all those corporate cultures was complicated, Bristow said, but a process almost complete that should help the company focus on growing. 
The newfound focus on internal growth comes as Bristow pushes the mining industry to better invest in host communities.
""They are stakeholders that are as important as our own shareholders,"" he said.
""BETTER FISH TO FRY"" 
Bristow said the company will strike a deal should an appealing one present itself, which he described as a mine that can produce 500,000 ounces of gold annually ""for a long time"" and be profitable at gold prices of $1,200 an ounce. But he stressed that acquisitions would be a secondary focus. 
As a tangible sign that his deal interest may be cooling, Bristow said he has no interest in buying a stake in Zambia's Mopani Copper Mines, which government-controlled mining investment arm ZCCM-IH took control of from Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc earlier this year. ZCCM has said it is searching for an external investment partner.
Bristow also in the past year repeatedly floated a buyout of rival Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc, saying such a tie-up would make logical sense. Now, though, that interest is gone.
""It was absolutely the right thing to consider,"" Bristow said. ""But right now, today, I think there are better fish to fry than Freeport."" 
Toronto-based Barrick has no interest in nickel, lithium or other metals used to make electric vehicles and will deepen its focus on copper and gold, which are often found together geologically, Bristow added. 

Separately, Bristow said he supports Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema's plan to rework mining policies and boost industry investment.
He added that he is eager to complete a deal with Papau New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape to restart the Porgera gold mine after a protracted licensing fight.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) expects to double the number of members on its new platform for cryptocurrency trading to 1,000 by end-December and grow this by 20-30% annually for the next three years as digital tokens gain acceptability.
In an interview, DBS's senior executives said DBS Digital Exchange, set up in December as a members-only bourse, is seeing robust demand from corporate investors, accredited individuals and investment firms that manage the fortunes of wealthy families.
""We are growing very rapidly. Investors are gradually exploring cryptocurrencies and digital assets,"" said Eng-Kwok Seat Moey, head of capital markets at DBS, Southeast Asia's largest bank by assets, and chairperson of the exchange.
DBS's foray in the crypto business come after its CEO Piyush Gupta steered the bank to invest billions of dollars to upgrade its technology infrastructure over the past eight years as it embraced cloud computing and digitised its services.
DBS Digital Exchange bills itself as the world's only bank-backed full service digital bourse - offering cryptocurrency trading, asset tokenisation and digital custody services, in a crypto sector where investor trust is still low.
Soaring popularity of cryptocurrencies has posed a problem for mainstream banks as they try and balance clients' interest in digital coins with regulatory concerns about their risks.
A unit of Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) is setting up a joint venture https://www.reuters.com/technology/stanchart-unit-launch-cryptocurrency-trading-venture-2021-06-02 to establish a cryptocurrency brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, while HSBC said it has no plans to offer digital currencies to customers https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-hsbc-ceo-says-bitcoin-not-us-2021-05-24.
Eng-Kwok said DBS' position as one of the biggest wealth managers in Asia and its expertise in originating deals in capital markets would help it attract users and grow trading volume. 
The move comes at a time when DBS, like other banks, is looking to boost fee-based income as net interest income decreases amid low interest rates.
Eng-Kwok said the bourse hopes to list at least half a dozen security tokens by end-2022.
Singapore's central bank brought crypto businesses under a new regulatory framework that came into effect in January 2020.
DBS' brokerage arm has received an-principle approval under the new regime, which will allow it to directly support asset managers and companies to trade in digital payment tokens through the bourse. The Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) has a 10% stake in the bourse.
""Having mainstream banks helps foster an environment where settlement risk is minimal and there are safeguards in place for custody of user deposits and security of transactions,"" said Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School in Britain.
Last week, Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said it will restrict its services in Singapore https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/binance-removes-singapore-products-main-platform-after-regulators-warning-2021-09-06 days after the central bank told it to stop offering payment services.
DBS Digital Exchange offers trading services between bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and XRP, and U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong dollars and the yen.
""Our aim was to create a platform that could serve the entire digital asset value chain, from deal origination to tokenisation, listing, trading, and custody – all within a trusted and regulated bank franchise,"" said Kwee Juan Han, DBS' group head of strategy and planning.
Han said a trend of companies exploring fundraising options through tokenised assets, and growing interest by private investors to expand the share of digital assets in portfolios offered DBS a timely opportunity to launch the bourse.

He said DBS expects its new businesses, including the digital exchange and a carbon exchange to bring in total revenue of S$350 million ($260 million) by the end of next year.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 07:56PM ET</span>","Tesla, Toyota spar with Ford, UAW over EV tax bill","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) clashed with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union over a proposal by Democrats in the U.S. House to give union-made, U.S.-built electric vehicles an additional $4,500 tax incentive.
In a letter to Congress, Toyota said the plan discriminates against nearly half of American autoworkers who do not belong to a union and called on lawmakers to reject giving ""exorbitant tax breaks"" to wealthy buyers of high-priced cars and trucks.
The bill, set to be taken up on Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee as part of a proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (NYSE:GM),  Ford Motor Co  and Stellantis NV, the parent of Chrysler - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in UAW-represented plants. 
The proposal boosts the maximum tax credit for these electric vehicles to $12,500 - including a $500 credit for using U.S.-made batteries - from the current $7,500, which stays the same for all others. The bill also does away with phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible again, along with Tesla Inc, although Tesla would not receive the higher credit.
Tesla and foreign automakers operating in the United States do not have unions representing assembly workers and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Sunday that the EV incentives were ""written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.""
Ford builds its electric Mustang Mach-E in Mexico, although these vehicles would not qualify for the larger tax credit.
Asked to respond, Ford spokesman Mark Truby said Ford will build its EV F-150 Lightning in Michigan and all-electric E-Transit van in Kansas City ""with much more to come.""
The UAW did not comment on Musk's tweet, but noted that most autoworkers globally were union represented.
""American tax money should pay for products here and American workers deserve the same voice as every other autoworker in the world,"" it said on its website.
Honda Motor, which has auto plants in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio, said the EV incentive ""discriminates among EVs made by hard-working American auto workers based simply on whether they belong to a union.""
Toyota does not currently build any full EVs in the United States but has plans to sell two new EVs in the U.S. next year.

Stellantis, meanwhile, praised the plan, saying it ""spur the market by making electrified vehicles affordable for more Americans, which in turn will support well-paying, middle-class jobs.""
The bill also proposes a new EV tax credit for commercial vehicles, a 15% credit for electric bicycles and a $2,500 credit for used EVs.

(Reuters) -Walmart Inc said on Monday it was looking into how a fake press statement announcing a partnership with litecoin, which briefly led to near 30% gains in the cryptocurrency, was issued by news release distributor GlobeNewswire.
The fake press release touting the acceptance of litecoin as online payment by the world's largest retailer led to a sudden spike in its prices, but the gains faded quickly after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) issued a statement saying the press release was fraudulent.
""Walmart had no knowledge of the press release issued by GlobeNewswire and there is no truth to it. Walmart has no relationship with litecoin,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters.
GlobeNewswire published a notice to ""disregard"" the news release and said it had put in place enhanced authentication steps to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. 
""We will work with the appropriate authorities to request – and facilitate – a full investigation, including into any criminal activity associated with this matter,"" GlobeNewswire said in an emailed statement.
Separately, the Litecoin Foundation said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post it had no information on where the news release had originated. 
The foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes the cryptocurrency and is run by litecoin creator Charlie Lee, who told Reuters in an email that the hoax was being investigated but little headway had been made. 
Lee also said he currently owned only five litecoins and had little incentive to issue the fake announcement himself.
Referring to a now deleted post by litecoin's verified Twitter handle sharing the fake announcement, Lee said: ""It was our mistake for retweeting using @litecoin.""

""We will make sure to have stricter controls on our social media accounts so that something like this doesn't happen again.""
Reuters and other news outlets had reported on the partnership. Reuters withdrew its initial story.

When you add in a value component, you get the best of both worlds. That's why investors should consider growth at a reasonable price stocks such as  Westlake Chemical  Corporation (NYSE:WLK), ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN), AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN).Even with last week’s fall in prices, growth stocks have been the better-performing stocks over the past month. We saw strong year-over-year growth from many companies that reported second results. While this type of growth is unlikely to maintain at its current pace, many companies are still expected to see strong growth over the next few quarters.
However, investors need to be mindful of heightened valuations which is why they should consider a GARP strategy. GARP stands for growth at a reasonable price. This strategy entails investing in stocks that have the potential for growth and trading at discount prices. These stocks can offer quick profits over the near term.
To find GARP stocks with near-term potential, I ran a screen using our POWR Ratings system to find stocks with an overall rating of Buy or Strong Buy, a Growth Grade of A or B, a Value Grade of A or B, and a five year expected EPS growth rate of 20% or higher.

The deal, expected to close by the second quarter of fiscal 2022, is  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU)'s biggest-ever acquisition. It will be financed through cash on hand and new debt of about $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion, Intuit said. Last year, the company bought personal finance portal Credit Karma for just over $7 billion. 
The deal for Atlanta-based Mailchimp, which operates a marketing platform for small- and mid-market businesses, will help Intuit add insights to its Quickbooks platform that tracks spending. 
""There is incredible power in combining the customer data and the purchase data, and we wanted to put the power of the data in our customers hands,"" said Sasan Goodarzi, Chief Executive at Intuit.
The deal comes at a time when fintech companies like Intuit are benefiting from a recovery from the pandemic-induced slump among small businesses. The company has projected profit and revenue levels above estimates for fiscal 2022.
Founded in 2001, Mailchimp traces its roots to a Web design agency called the Rocket Science Group, which cofounders Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius started to focus on big corporate clients, according to its website. 
They shut down the agency in 2007 to focus exclusively on Mailchimp, which they ran as an email marketing service for small businesses. Without external funding, the company has been profitable, and touts more than 12 million clients globally.
Mailchimp reported $800 million in revenue in 2020, a 20% year-over-year growth. Half of its revenue comes from outside the United States. The company will continue to be based in Atlanta, Georgia, and operate under its current brand following the acquisition. 
Mountain View, California-based Intuit's products include TurboTax, a software that helps Americans file income tax returns, and QuickBooks, a cloud-based application that helps small businesses manage payments. 
Intuit, which was started in 1983 by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx, went public 10 years later and now has more than 10,000 employees across 20 offices in nine locations worldwide.
The deal is expected to add to Intuit's adjusted earnings for full-year fiscal 2022. 

The two firms started to discuss partnerships over a year ago, and those discussions later evolved into talking about an acquisition. Bloomberg reported on the talks earlier in September. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) served as financial adviser to Intuit, with Latham & Watkins serving as its legal adviser. Qatalyst Partners and King & Spalding LLP advised Mailchimp.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group's struggles to quickly sell off assets and avert defaulting on its 1.97 trillion yuan ($305.3 billion) in liabilities is raising the risk of contagion for other privately-owned developers, fund managers and analysts say.
Worries over the country's No.2 property developer's ability to make bank loan interest and wealth management product payments have led to a worsening sell-off in its bonds and shares in the past week.
Evergrande's offshore bonds have dropped to less than a quarter of their face value, trading of its onshore bonds has been paused, and a stock price rout has deepened, knocking more than three-quarters off its market capitalisation this year.
""Telling property guys to de-leverage so quickly is like telling a 900-pound guy to drop to under 100 pounds,"" said a fixed income asset manager who declined to be identified due to sensitivities around the issue. 
""It won't be the obesity that kills him, but the process of losing so much weight (so quickly).""
With about $20 billion in outstanding offshore bonds, Evergrande is one of the world's biggest emerging market issuers of dollar debt, and the company's woes have driven an index of Chinese high-yield dollar issuers to 16-month lows.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said bond market volatility will exacerbate some developers' efforts to refinance, adding that its rated developers were due to repay 480 billion yuan worth on onshore and offshore maturities over the next 12 months.
Privately-owned developers Guangzhou R&F Properties Co and Xinyuan Real Estate Co, downgraded this month over concerns they will struggle to repay debts, have seen yields on their bonds surge above 30% in a sign of weakening access to market funding.
Evergrande vowed on Friday to repay all of its matured wealth management products as soon as possible, which lifted its dollar bonds, but analysts see more difficulties ahead. 
""The property sector is under pressure and some developers are under the risk of bankruptcy...the bond market is reflecting that reality,"" said Larry Hu, economist at Macquarie Capital in Hong Kong. ""We're going to see more developers go bankrupt in the coming months.""
Evergrande's debt pains after years of aggressive expansion come amid a sweeping clean-up of the property market that has formed a key pillar of Beijing's new campaign of ""Common Prosperity"", which many observers have seen as a return to China's socialist roots.
But while private homebuilders struggle, steady onshore credit spreads indicate Chinese investors remain unconcerned for now about risks spilling into the broader banking system.
""Contagion from Evergrande to other developers will be clearer for high-yield and private debtors. The impact on state-owned developers and banks is limited as far as bond prices are concerned,"" economists at Natixis said in a note.

February 2023 dollar bonds of state-owned developer Poly Developments and Holdings Group Co were trading at a premium of nearly 3% to their face value on Monday, yielding 1.78%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed higher on Monday, ending a five-day losing streak as investors focused on potential corporate tax hikes and upcoming economic data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also advanced, but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended lower.
Investors favored value over growth, with stocks set to benefit most from a resurging economy enjoying the biggest percentage gains.
""There are probably not a lot of positive surprises coming this month,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi in New York. ""We're having another period of volatility where I think that rotation could go back to cyclicals and the reopened trade, as the 10-year bond rate slowly grinds higher through the end of the year.""
Market participants are focused on the likely passage of U.S. President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion budget package, which is expected to include a proposed corporate tax rate hike to 26.5% from 21%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts see the corporate tax rate increasing to 25% and the passage of about half of a proposed increase to tax rates on foreign income, which they estimate would reduce S&P 500 earnings by 5% in 2022.
The Labor Department is due to release its consumer price index data on Tuesday, which could shed further light on the current inflation wave and whether it is as transitory as the Fed insists.
""I don't see inflation settling back down under 2% where it was pre-pandemic,"" Young added. ""Even if some of those transitory forces weaken, we will still stay at a higher rate than we were before."" 
Other key indicators due this week include retail sales and consumer sentiment, which could illuminate how much the demand boom driven by economic re-engagement has been dampened by the highly contagious COVID-19 Delta variant.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 261.91 points, or 0.76%, to 34,869.63, the S&P 500 gained 10.15 points, or 0.23%, at 4,468.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.91 points, or 0.07%, to 15,105.58.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, healthcare suffered the largest percentage loss, while energy, buoyed by rising crude prices was the biggest gainer.
Shares of vaccine makers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) sank 6.6% and 2.2%, respectively, after experts said COVID booster shots are not widely needed.
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc announced plans to raise about $1.5 billion through a debt offering aimed at funding product development and potential acquisitions. The cryptocurrency exchanges shares slid 2.2%.
Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) dipped 1.2% as rival Freshworks Inc's regulatory filing indicated that the business engagement and customer engagement software company is aiming for a nearly $9 billion valuation in it U.S. debut.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 71 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.30 billion shares, compared with the 9.29 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company pared losses and were down 1.4% in extended trading after the company forecast second quarter adjusted earnings per share above expectations.
The company expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.09 and $1.13, above analysts' average estimate of $1.08, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Analysts say Oracle, whose shares have risen about 40% this year, is well positioned to benefit from cloud computing but a crowded space of rivals, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp, will keep the heat on the company.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Monday approved up to $7.1 million in bonuses for five executives of Purdue Pharma, the bankrupt maker of OxyContin, at a hearing at which he faced blunt criticism for his handling of the case from a woman whose son died of an opioid overdose. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, signed off on the executive incentive plan at the conclusion of the virtual hearing.
His ruling comes about two weeks after he said he would approve Purdue’s reorganization plan, which rests on a $10 billion settlement https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/judge-rule-purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-plan-that-shields-sacklers-2021-09-01 of opioid-related lawsuits and provides legal releases shielding the Sackler family members that owned the company from future opioid-related civil litigation. 
The Sacklers contributed approximately $4.5 billion to the plan, which had wide support from creditors who voted on it, but critics have been angered that the family will retain billion of dollars and never face a public civil trial.
""OxyContin tore our family to shreds,"" Ellen Isaacs, whose son died of an opioid overdose, told Drain during Monday's hearing, urging him to approve her motion to reconsider his ruling and recuse himself from the case.
More than 500,000 Americans have died since 1999 from opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
During a 30-minute statement to the court, Isaacs delivered a rare courtroom reprimand to the judge, saying it's ""well known"" that the bankruptcy was filed before Drain because the Sacklers knew he had a history of approving releases like the one they sought.
She also said the Sacklers, who have denied wrongdoing, should face criminal charges and that victims and their families are being allocated too little through Purdue's plan.
Drain denied her request and said that while he has “no love lost for the Sacklers,” he did not feel “manipulated by anyone” in the case. He also noted that the releases, which he said are supported by many courts across the country, do not protect the Sacklers against potential criminal liability.
A representative for the Mortimer Sackler family referred a request for comment to a prior statement disputing allegations made about the family and saying it is ""truly sorry for the suffering and loss people have experienced and recognize the anger or hurt that many people have felt.""
The total incentive payments for Purdue executives for 2021 is $4 million to $5.4 million, depending on their ability to meet their goals as they continue to work toward a bankruptcy exit. They could also collect up to an additional $1.7 million in long-term incentives. The executives would have to meet targets related to operating profits, net sales and deadlines for testing and development of non-opioid products.

Drain said he did not consider the incentive payments he was approving “bonuses” because even if paid out in full, they would still only fall in the middle of the total compensation range for executives at major pharmaceutical companies. 
“No doubt my ruling will be construed by some as authorizing large bonuses to executives. I do not believe that is in fact the case here,” he said.

(Reuters) -The Illinois Senate on Monday saved two  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) nuclear power plants from closure by passing a bill that will provide $700 million in subsidies to the company over five years for generating virtually carbon-free power. 
Exelon had threatened to close its Byron nuclear plant on Monday and Dresden nuclear plant in November
because of rising costs and competition from power plants that burn low-cost natural gas. 
The Senate passed the bill 37-17. The house approved the measure last week after a compromise deal on coal plant closures favored by both environmentalists and labor groups.
Exelon said it was preparing to refuel its 40-year-old Byron and Dresden plants after the Senate vote. 
""The threat to our planet is real,"" said Senate President Don Harmon, a Democrat. ""Our goal all along was to enact reliable, renewable and affordable energy policies that position Illinois to lead the nation in combating climate change and growing a green energy economy.""
While nuclear power plants create toxic waste for which there is no permanent U.S. repository, some environmentalists and politicians praise nuclear energy as climate friendly because it generates virtually carbon-free power. Nuclear plants also tend to pay some of the energy industry's highest wages.
The coal plant deal requires private coal-fired plants to shut by 2030. Municipal coal plants must cut carbon emissions 45% by 2035 and achieve zero emissions or close by 2045.

Some lawmakers including Senator Chapin Rose, a Republican, said the closure of coal plants would simply lead to more imports of coal-fired electricity from Indiana and Kentucky.
Gina McCarthy, President Joe Biden's climate adviser, has said existing nuclear plants are ""absolutely essential"" to hit U.S. goals to decarbonize the electric grid by 2035. The administration has supported federal incentives for the industry. The United States has 93 nuclear reactors, down from 104 in 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department said it was offering $482.3 million in aviation manufacturing assistance to 313 businesses, including up to $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR). 
Congress earlier this year created a $3 billion aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program that will cover up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for as long as six months. Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corp (NYSE:PH) was offered up to $39.7 million, Connecticut-based Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) Corp offered $20.9 million and Astronics (NASDAQ:ATRO) Corp $14.7 million.
The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Of the 313 companies receiving funds, 188 of them - 60% - had fewer than 100 employees at the end of calendar year 2020.
The funds will help support as many as 22,500 jobs nationwide.
U.S. Senator Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said 31 Kansas companies will receive $104 million in payroll grants including Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said $41 million will go to 32 companies in her home state of Washington.
""With aviation manufacturing not targeted to recover until well into 2022, at the earliest, this aviation protection program will help in hiring back some of those workers and staving off further layoffs at a critical time,"" said Cantwell, a Democrat.
More than 100,000 jobs have been lost in the aerospace industry since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Transportation Department. Before then, the U.S. aerospace industry employed approximately 2.2 million workers, including 1.2 million who worked in various parts of the supply chain nationwide.
The offer requires companies to commit to not conducting furloughs without employee consent or laying off employees covered by subsidies during the six-month period.
Companies eligible include aircraft, engine, propeller or component manufacturers and companies that repair or overhaul airplanes and parts.
To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or have experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue.

Applications for a second round of funding closed Sept. 1 and additional funding recipients will be announced this fall, the Transportation Department said.
Some big aviation companies like  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's GE Aviation and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co declined to apply for the subsidy.

(Reuters) - Fox Corp-owned Fox Entertainment has acquired the TMZ entertainment platform and its media properties from AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc-owned WarnerMedia, Fox announced Monday.
Financial terms were not disclosed. 
Fox Entertainment - along with Fox News Media, Fox Sports and Fox Television Stations - is part of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp.
As part of the deal, Fox will own and operate all TMZ-branded media properties, including the syndicated TV shows “TMZ” and “TMZ Live,"" both of which air on network affiliates owned by Fox Television Stations; the sports site TMZ Sports and program “TMZ Sports,” celebrity and culture website TooFab.com and TMZ.com, and celebrity tour operations in Los Angeles and New York.
TMZ founder and Managing Editor Harvey Levin will remain with TMZ and continue to oversee day-to-day operations for the brand, Fox said in a news release. He will report to Rob Wade, Fox Entertainment’s president of Alternative Entertainment and Specials. 
AT&T is in the process of unwinding its expensive media investments to focus on its original business of providing phone and internet services.

It is combining WarnerMedia’s media assets with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc to create a proposed stand-alone company, Warner Bros. Discovery, in a deal expected to close next year.
Last December, AT&T agreed to sell its Crunchyroll Inc anime business to  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s Funimation Global Group LLC, in a $1.18 billion deal.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc has approached Tronox Holdings Plc, one of the world's largest pigment manufacturers, with a $4.3 billion all-cash offer, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Apollo has offered $27 per share to buy Stamford, Connecticut-based Tronox, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Tronox has hired advisers to consider the bid and has yet to decide on its next steps, the sources added. 
Tronox shares were hovering around $20 on Monday morning, prior to Apollo's offer being reported. They jumped 17% to $24.02 on news of Apollo's acquisition interest. 
The sources cautioned that there is no certainty that Tronox will agree to any deal. 
Apollo declined to comment. Tronox did not respond to a request for comment.
Tronox makes titanium dioxide pigment and other chemicals used to add brightness and durability to paints, plastics and paper.
The COVID-19 pandemic weighed on demand for many of Tronox's products, but the company has said its core markets are recovering as the world's major economies bounce back.

Tronox was spun out of Kerr-McGee Corp in 2005, and in 2019 it acquired the titanium dioxide business of Saudi Arabia's National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd from Saudi Arabia's Tasnee. Tasnee, through a subsidiary, is now Tronox's biggest shareholder with a 24% stake.
Tronox in March named its top executives John Romano and Jean-Francois Turgeon as co-chief executives after its previous CEO Jeffry Quinn was referenced, without being mentioned by name, in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaints alleging insider trading at Ferro (NYSE:FOE) Corp, another chemicals company where Quinn served as board director. Tronox did not disclose whether Quinn was accused of any wrongdoing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The civil trial of three former  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co employees over their alleged roles in a scandal involving phony accounts kicked off on Monday, a rare public confrontation between a top U.S. banking regulator and former high-level bank executives.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is squaring off against executives it says are partly culpable for the San Francisco lender's misconduct before an in-house OCC judge in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in a hearing expected to last at least two weeks. 
The long-running scandal over Wells Fargo's pressurized sales culture that led staff to open millions of unauthorized or fraudulent customer accounts has cost the bank billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties and has badly damaged its reputation. 
The OCC alleges that Wells Fargo's former risk officer, Claudia Russ Anderson, former chief auditor David Julian and former executive audit director Paul McLinko failed to adequately perform their duties and responsibilities, contributing to Wells Fargo's ""systemic sales practices misconduct"" from 2002 to 2016. 
The proceedings mark a significant step for a regulator that has been criticized in the past for being too soft on the banks and executives it oversees, said regulatory experts.
""It's an attempt at personal accountability for big-bank executives we have not seen in a long time, including in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis,"" said Jeremy Kress, an assistant business professor at the University of Michigan.
In testimony on Monday, OCC official Greg Coleman laid out the OCC's view that the three former Wells Fargo executives were responsible for the misconduct because they were the bank's key ""lines of defense"" against bad behavior and other risks.
Wells Fargo's ""incentive sales program was implemented without risk-management controls, without proactive monitoring and it essentially incented the bank employees to open fraudulent accounts, to provide misleading information to customers, resulting in significant harm,"" said Coleman, OCC's senior deputy comptroller for large bank supervision and the first witness to testify.
The regulator brought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-regulator-charges/u-s-bank-regulator-charges-ex-wells-fargo-executives-for-role-in-sales-scandal-idUSKBN1ZM2M2 civil charges last year against the trio, as well as other former Wells Fargo executives, and has demanded they pay nearly $19 million combined to settle the matter. The OCC is also seeking to bar Russ Anderson from the banking industry over the allegations. 
Attorneys for the trio did not respond to requests for comment. 
Matthew Martens, an attorney representing Julian, said during the hearing that the trio's attorneys had been blocked from gathering background information on OCC examiners and from calling OCC witnesses.

""We were stopped from calling four OCC examiners who would have provided testimony that we believe would be evidence of bias, incompetence"" and credibility issues, he said. 
A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment beyond a January 2020 statement in which CEO and President Charlie Scharf said the OCC's actions were consistent with holding the firm and individuals accountable for ""inexcusable"" sales practices issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will nominate Alvaro Bedoya, a privacy advocate and Georgetown University law professor, to serve on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the White House said on Monday.
""It is the honor of my life to be nominated to serve on the FTC. When my family landed at JFK in 1987 with 4 suitcases and a grad student stipend, this was not what we expected,"" tweeted Bedoya on Monday afternoon. ""Vamos,"" he added, which is Spanish for ""let's go.""
Bedoya, the founding director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology, is also a former chief counsel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. The FTC post requires Senate confirmation.
In its statement, the White House praised Bedoya for work exposing the harms of facial recognition technology, leading to restrictions on its use and audits to ferret out biases in the systems.
Bedoya in a lecture at the University of New Mexico in 2019 called privacy ""a civil right.""
""At its heart, privacy is about human dignity: Whether the government feels it can invade your dignity, and whether the government feels it has to protect the most sensitive, most intimate facts of your life,"" Bedoya said.
Bedoya has been skeptical of widespread, untargeted use of facial recognition technology, calling it in a 2017 newspaper opinion piece something that creates ""profound questions about the future of our society."" In the piece, Bedoya also notes that the software often makes mistakes, particularly when searching for the faces of African Americans, women and young people.
Bedoya, if confirmed, would step into a post currently held by Rohit Chopra, who has been nominated by Biden to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)- a political lightning rod since it was created following the 2009 financial crisis.
Bedoya was born in Peru but is a naturalized U.S. citizen.
The five-member FTC currently has three Democrats, including Chairwoman Lina Khan, and two Republicans. If Chopra were to be confirmed to the CFPB and step down, the FTC would have two members from each party. 

The agency enforces antitrust law and pursues allegations of deceptive advertising. 
FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips, a Republican, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that Bedoya ""would bring a bright and thoughtful voice and a depth of experience working across the aisle on privacy to the FTC.""

A great strategy for them is to consider companies with sustainable business models that are Buy-rated and priced under $100, which can include Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), BHP Group Ltd. (NYSE:BHP), and  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE).While some investors like to manage their portfolios actively, others prefer to buy stocks for the long term. This means holding onto stocks for as long as thirty years to even forever. However, you can't just hold any stock forever. Plenty of companies seem like a great bet one year, only to plummet the next. The types of stocks that you can hold forever must have sustainable business models, they should be leaders in their fields, and have long reputations as strong companies. They should also be growing and have solid balance sheets. 
With the market continuing to hit new heights, many of the share prices of these companies are in the hundreds or even thousands. This makes it hard for investors with limited capital to purchase large quantities of shares.
However, there are still top companies that you can hold forever trading below $100. And while $100 is definitely not considered a low-priced stock, it is nowhere near the prices of companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). When you combine that price level with the power of our POWR Ratings system, you get great long-term picks such as Coca-Cola Company (KO), BHP Group Ltd. (BHP), and Pfizer Inc. (PFE).

REITs, which by regulation pay high dividends, are expected to perform well in the low-interest-rate environment. Hence, we think it could be wise to bet on high-yielding REITs Saul Centers (NYSE:BFS), Granite Point Mortgage Trust (NYSE:GPMT), and CatchMark Timber Trust (NYSE:CTT). Let’s discuss.After five straight days of declines, today’s stock market performance suggests a revival of positive investor sentiment. However, concerns over the pace of economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases may not abate anytime soon. This, along with rising inflation, could lead to a more extensive stock market correction in the near term.
Given this backdrop, betting on high dividend-yielding stocks could be a safer option. Since real estate investment trusts (REITs) are known for paying high dividends, we think it could be wise to pick a few stocks from this industry because REITs typically benefit from a low-interest-rate environment.
High dividend-yielding REITs Saul Centers, Inc. (BFS),  Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc . (GPMT), and CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. (CTT) possess solid fundamentals. So, it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

Oil prices rose significantly last week, fueled by concerns over U.S. supplies following damage from Hurricane Ida and expectations of higher demand. Furthermore, natural gas prices have risen 99% year-to-date, bolstered by supply concerns and rising demand. Analysts expect natural gas prices to continue to rise. In addition, gas prices could double if there is an especially cold winter.

(Reuters) -Three media companies affiliated with Chinese businessman Guo Wengui have agreed to pay more than $539 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges they illegally sold stock and digital assets to thousands of investors, the regulator said on Monday.
The SEC charged New York-based GTV Media Group Inc and Saraca Media Group Inc and Phoenix-based Voice of Guo Media Inc with the illegal unregistered offering of GTV common stock. GTV and Saraca were also charged with the illegal unregistered offering of a digital asset security called G-Coins or G-Dollars. 
The firms solicited thousands of individuals to invest in the GTV stock offering from April through June 2020 through the firms' websites and on social media platforms, according to the SEC. GTV and Saraca also solicited individuals to invest in the digital asset offering. Altogether, the firms raised about $487 million from more than 5,000 investors through the offerings.
The companies did not admit or deny the SEC's findings. An attorney for GTV and Saraca said the firms were pleased to reach a resolution and return funds to supporters. An attorney for Voice of Guo Media did not respond to a request for comment.
GTV has also reportedly been linked to Steve Bannon, a former top political strategist for former President Donald Trump. Neither Bannon nor Guo were accused of any wrongdoing in the SEC's charges.

To settle the charges, GTV and Saraca agreed to disgorge over $434 million plus prejudgment interest of approximately $16 million, and to each pay a civil penalty of $15 million, the SEC said. 
Voice of Guo also agreed to a cease-and-desist order, to pay disgorgement of more than $52 million plus prejudgment interest of nearly $2 million, and to pay a civil penalty of $5 million.

(Reuters) - Credit card issuer  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) will test a ""buy now, pay later"" product this year as competition for consumer loans builds from financial technology firms providing merchants with easy ways to offer cheap financing for purchases.
""We will be testing a beta version of our own 'buy now, pay later' product,"" Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said at a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) investor conference on Monday.
Fairbank said Capital One's test will include point-of-sale loans for customers at a ""select set of merchants"" with which it already has relationships.
Banks and bank investors have been increasingly wary that 'buy now, pay later' loans might cut into a potential rebound in lending revenue from people who used credit cards for borrowing purposes.
Many customers have paid down credit card balances during the coronavirus pandemic and eliminated interest charges. But some have described https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-consumers-pay-later-idUSKBN2A8036 being tempted by 'buy now, pay later' plans to borrow for items they want only to then fall behind https://www.reuters.com/technology/buy-now-pay-later-surges-third-us-users-fall-behind-payments-2021-09-09 on payments and run up interest charges.
Fairbank said that Capital One will use knowledge from the tests to understand the products better and how they can appeal to merchants and consumers.
""We're watching this product closely and certainly not taking this growth lightly,"" he said.

Fairbank said the offerings have become suddenly popular due to support by venture capitalists and the willingness of merchants to subsidize the interest costs.
""The elephant in the room is the sustainability of the merchant subsidy,"" Fairbank said. ""This is fueled by merchants' beliefs that they're getting incremental volume.""

The pay package for Smith, a billionaire, faces a challenge at FedEx's annual shareholder meeting later this month after labor union the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said the company's decision to cancel a bonus program while giving him an option award instead, only to then re-instate the bonus program, amounted to double-dipping. 
ISS said in a report released on Sunday that ""cautionary support"" was warranted because Smith's awards have not led to a misalignment of pay and performance. Glass Lewis recommended last week that shareholders vote down the pay plan because it reflects a reversal in how the company initially structured executive compensation.
The shareholder vote on Sept. 27 is advisory and not binding on FedEx. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""People are grappling with how to assess the ad hoc adjustments and bonuses around COVID-19, and I think FedEx is an example of how not to do it and Glass Lewis's recommendation supports that,"" said Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the Teamsters, who are bargaining on behalf of FedEx employees at a freight facility. 
ISS said the re-instatement of the bonus raises some concern but that other awards to Smith have rigorous financial goals. FedEx's shares during its last fiscal year, ending at the end of May, more than doubled as the economy rebounded from the pandemic and more people shipped and received items. 

Many U.S. companies adjusted the pay of executives during the coronavirus outbreak, easing performance targets and even giving them pay rises. Investors voted down a record number of CEO pay packages at their annual shareholder meetings earlier this year.
Most companies take investor opposition to CEO pay into consideration when drafting executive compensation arrangements. Some will tweak pay for executives also, as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co did for then-CEO Bob Iger in 2018.

Investing.com -- Stocks mostly gained on Monday with less than a half-hour of trading left, though major technology stocks showed some weakness, as the focus turned to new tax proposals unveiled by Democrats to help pay for President Joe Biden’s social spending plans.
The proposals would raise taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans to help pay for the $3.5 trillion in spending on so-called social infrastructure like education, something the Democrats hope to pass during the budget reconciliation process.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)shares rose ahead of the iPhone maker’s product launch event on Tuesday, which will again be virtual. Over the weekend, Epic Games said it would appeal a judge’s ruling that Apple’s App Store was not a monopoly. 
Stocks of major oil companies also got a boost when the government agreed to sell out of the emergency reserve to companies including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Reuters reported.
Several analysts have sounded caution on stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 has hit 54 record closing highs so far this year, and many Wall Street pros are seeing the possibility of a pullback this fall. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings from the cloud
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is expected to report first-quarter earnings per share of 97 cents on revenue of $9.76 billion after tonight’s closing bell, though the stock will likely be followed tomorrow as well. The tech giant has been moving more of its business to the cloud, and analysts will be listening for news on that effort.
2. Core consumer prices
Core CPI, which excludes the effects of volatile food and energy prices, is seen rising by 4.2% year-on-year in August, a tad lower than the 4.3% uptick in July. On a month-on-month basis, it is expected to have risen by 0.3% in August, the same tick it grew by in July. The report comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Overall, CPI for August
August consumer prices are expected to have risen by 5.3% year-on-year, slower than July’s 5.4%. The July spike of 5.4%, same as June’s, matched the largest jump since August 2008. On a month-on-month basis, CPI is seen having risen by 0.4%. It grew by 0.5% in July. This report also comes out at 8:30 AM ET.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - JBS USA on Monday halted production at a Nebraska beef plant that slaughters about 5% of U.S. cattle due to a fire, but said the company expects to resume operations on Tuesday.
The temporary closure highlighted concerns among U.S. lawmakers and ranchers that the United States is vulnerable to supply disruptions because a handful of meatpacking companies dominate the sector and rely on large plants to produce food.
The country has suffered a series of beef supply shocks over the past two years as large plants closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a cyberattack that crippled JBS's operations, and another fire that shut a  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) plant in Kansas for months.
The JBS fire in Grand Island, Nebraska, did not impact the plant's ""primary production areas,"" spokesperson Nikki Richardson said. The company, a subsidiary of Brazilian firm  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), expects to resume operations on Tuesday pending an ongoing assessment of the situation, she said.
The blaze burned a hole in the roof of the part of the plant that handles rendering, and damage is confined to the rendering area, said Cory Schmidt, chief of the Grand Island Fire Department.
""Fortunately, JBS is very modular so if one area has an issue, for the most part it doesn't affect the other areas,"" he said. 

The plant has the capacity to slaughter 6,000 cattle a day, according to a daily livestock report from Steiner Consulting Group. Meatpackers slaughter about 120,000 cattle per day nationwide.
""This year, processing capacity has already been squeezed by COVID disruptions and labor availability and the industry can ill afford losing a big processing plant like this,"" Steiner Consulting said.

(Reuters) - U.S. grain exports slumped to their lowest level in years last week as shippers struggled to restart loading operations along the Louisiana Gulf Coast after Hurricane Ida flooded and damaged grain terminals and knocked out power across the region, preliminary data showed on Monday. 
Weekly U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grain inspections data, an early indicator of shipments abroad, showed the volume of corn weighed and certified for export last week was the lowest in 8-1/2 years as no grain was inspected along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, the busiest outlet for U.S. crops.
Soybean inspections were up only slightly from the prior week's seven-year low as only a single large bulk grain ship bound for top importer China was loaded last week in the Pacific Northwest and none at the Gulf, USDA data showed.
Ida crippled overseas grain shipments just weeks before the start of the Midwest harvest and the busiest period for U.S. crop exports, sending export prices soaring and stoking global worries about food inflation.
Most of the nearly dozen large grain terminals dotted along the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico escaped the storm with only minor damage, but the region's devastated power grid has hobbled the recovery. 
More than 50 bulk vessels were lined up along the lower Mississippi River on Monday waiting to dock and load with grain once terminals reopen, and only a handful of ships had moved over the weekend, according to an industry vessel lineup report and Refinitiv Eikon shipping data.
The vessel Yangze Navigation was docked at Zen-Noh Grain terminal in Convent, Louisiana, on Monday waiting to be loaded with corn, the shipping data showed. Another vessel, the Darya Aum, docked over the weekend and was awaiting its soybean cargo at a terminal owned by Louis Dreyfus Co near Baton Rouge that was able to start loading vessels last week.
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co, one of the world's biggest grain traders, restarted operations on floating midstream rigs that transfer crops from barges onto bulk ships.
The USDA's Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) said late last week that its New Orleans field office is still recovering from the storm and that its inspectors are working with exporters to provide official grain inspection and weighing services. The agency has no estimate as to when inspections will fully recover, FGIS said in an emailed statement.
FGIS inspectors checked just 138,189 tonnes of corn in the week through Sept. 9, down 85% from the same week a year ago, USDA data showed. Soybean inspections totaled 105,368 tonnes, down 94% from the same week a year earlier.

The city sued Amazon in May alleging its requirements barred third-party sellers from selling elsewhere for less than on Amazon. Amazon's prices include fees, which are up to 40 percent of the total price.
The new complaint includes allegations that Amazon has agreements with wholesalers that guarantee it a minimum profit. As a result, the complaint alleges, if Amazon lowers a price to compete with another online seller, the wholesaler must pay Amazon the difference between the price it sells at and the agreed minimum. These payments are a disincentive for wholesalers to lower prices to compete, the complaint said.

Amazon, which filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Friday, said that the Washington, D.C., lawsuit had it wrong.
""Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,"" it said in a statement. ""Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Additional COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are not needed for the general population, leading scientists including two departing senior U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials and several from the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an article published in a medical journal on Monday. 
The scientists said more evidence was needed to justify boosters. That view disagrees with U.S. government plans to begin offering another round of shots to many fully vaccinated Americans as soon as next week, contingent on approval from health regulators.
As COVID-19 cases caused by the Delta variant of the virus rise, President Joe Biden's administration is concerned that infections among those already vaccinated are a sign that their protection is waning and has pushed boosters as a way to rebuild immunity. 
The WHO has argued that the vaccines are still needed for first doses around the globe.
""Any decisions about the need for boosting or timing of boosting should be based on careful analyses of adequately controlled clinical or epidemiological data, or both, indicating a persistent and meaningful reduction in severe disease,"" the scientists wrote in the Lancet medical journal. 
The risk-benefit evaluation should consider the number of severe COVID-19 cases that boosting would be expected to prevent, and whether it is safe and effective against the current variants, they said. 
""Current evidence does not, therefore, appear to show a need for boosting in the general population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains high,"" the scientists wrote.
Some countries have begun COVID-19 booster campaigns, including Israel, providing some of the data on which the Biden administration has made its case for additional shots. 
The article's authors included the FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review Director Marion Gruber and Deputy Director Phil Krause, both of whom plan to leave the agency in the next several months.
They acknowledged that some individuals, such as those who are immunocompromised, could benefit from an additional dose.
Broader use of boosters may be needed in the future if there is waning immunity to the primary vaccination or if new variants evolve so that the vaccines no longer protect against the virus, they said.
Boosters could also prove risky if introduced too soon or too frequently, the scientists wrote. 
A panel of experts that advises the FDA on vaccines plans to meet on Sept. 17 to discuss additional doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, the first step in a wider booster roll-out. 

The article's authors included WHO top scientists Soumya Swaminathan, Ana-Maria Henao-Restrepo and Mike Ryan. 
""Current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations,"" the authors wrote.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean union at  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp, the world's top lithium producer, said on Monday it had rejected the company's latest labor contract offer, leaving workers to continue a walk off that has extended for more than a month.
The 135-member ""Albemarle Salar"" union, which comprises about half the workers at its key Salar production plant, went on strike in August after failing to reach a deal with the U.S.-based lithium miner. The company maintains the extended walk-off has yet to hit its output of lithium.
The union said in a statement issued Monday that the latest deal offered nothing beyond two prior proposals that were also rejected. The union called the contract offer ""discriminatory"" and said it would only foster salary inequality among its workers.
Albemarle told Reuters it regretted the union's decision but rejected its claims of unfairness.
""The Salar (union) aspires to a bonus for the termination of the conflict that is much higher than that of the other three unions with which we successfully concluded collective bargaining,"" the company said in a statement. 
Albemarle's Atacama operations in Chile are a vital source of the ultralight white metal used in batteries that power electric vehicles. Competitor SQM operates nearby. 
The company, which struck labor deals with its three remaining Chilean guilds earlier this year, said again on Monday it had a ""solid"" contingency plan that assured it could continue to meet its customers needs during the walk-off.

The union has alleged the miner had been flying workers in by helicopter to replace those on strike, a practice it said violated union rights. 
Albemarle extracts lithium-rich brine from beneath the salt flat at its Salar plant, then processes the distilled brines into battery grade lithium carbonate at its La Negra chemical plant near the city of  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) in northern Chile.

Investing.com – Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) traded lower Monday as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) put them in the sell category of U.S. internet stocks.
Both the stocks were down 3% to 4%.
Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan sees Airbnb at $132, around 17.5% lower from its current level of $160. He kept a target of $60 for Twitter and the stock fell below that level in today’s session.
Airbnb shares have a negative risk-reward skew when measured against a likely volatile travel environment in future, a relatively mature end-market and high levels of competitive intensity among players, the analyst said.
At the same time, Sheridan showed faith in the company, saying it is a strong player with runway for growth and margin expansion in the coming years.
He sees Airbnb generating a 2021-2026 revenue compound annual growth rate of 21% and a 2026 adjusted earnings margin of 32%.
In the second quarter, Airbnb’s nights and experiences booked almost trebled to 83.1 million. Gross booking value soared 320% to $13.4 billion while revenue quadrupled to $1.3 billion.
Net loss significantly narrowed to $68 million from $575 million in June quarter of 2020.
In Twitter’s case, the analyst said Goldman views the company as more of a differentiated media/publishing platform rather than the usual categorization of it being a social media platform.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended higher for the first time in five days on Monday, as oil, banks and utility shares gained on hopes that a strong euro zone economic recovery would outweigh risks from a global slowdown.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.3% after hitting a three-week low last week. Asian stocks, however, fell following news of fresh regulatory crackdown on Chinese firms. [MKTS/GLOB]
Global stocks have come under pressure recently after months-long gains on worries about inflation, tighter COVID-19 curbs in Asian economies, China's regulatory moves, and growing views that central banks will soon start paring stimulus.
While those concerns remain, European investors took comfort as the European Central Bank last week raised its growth and inflation projections for this year and beyond, as the euro zone economy recovers quicker than expected from the pandemic shock.
""While we are used to seeing US markets lead the way, there is a feeling that we could see greater catch-up for Europe as high vaccination levels keep deaths relatively stable,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. 
Economy-sensitive sectors, including banks, oil and gas, and construction and materials, rose between 0.9% and 2.8%, while utilities climbed 1.6%. 
All eyes will be on the U.S. consumer prices data on Tuesday after soaring producer prices last week raised doubts about the U.S. Federal Reserve's view that inflation is transitory.
""Some central bankers will have you believe they are happy to hold back on tightening for now, we are seeing very clear signs that this spike in inflation is far from fleeting,"" IG's Mahony said. 
Meanwhile, a September market sentiment survey published by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) showed an equity market correction of 5%-10% by the end of the year was the overwhelming consensus.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>","Biden vaccine plan hinges on rarely used rule, inviting legal challenges","By Tom Hals and Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's plan requiring more than 100 million Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19 relies on a rarely used workplace rule with a history of being blocked in court, making it an inviting target for legal challenges by employers.
As part of Biden's plan, unveiled Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-deliver-six-step-plan-covid-19-pandemic-2021-09-09, private employers with 100 or more staff must ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated or produce a negative COVID-19 test weekly. 
The measure will be implemented through an emergency temporary standard, or ETS, issued by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which regulates workplaces. The rule is expected in the coming weeks, and it was not clear when it would take effect.
OSHA can implement an emergency standard when workers are exposed to a ""grave danger"" and the standard is needed to protect them. This allows the agency to cut short the usual process for developing a standard, which averages seven years.
The Republican National Committee and some Republican state governors have already threatened https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-angers-republicans-libertarians-2021-09-10 to sue over Biden's vaccine plan, which also covers most federal employees and contractors, and some healthcare workers.
While many large employers have said they plan to comply https://www.reuters.com/world/us/corporate-union-reaction-biden-vaccine-mandate-companies-2021-09-09, some businesses are also likely to sue.
""Some employers reflexively oppose OSHA,"" said Michael Duff, a professor at University of Wyoming College of Law. ""They will not like this precedent.""
Opponents could argue a grave danger, which is not defined in the law, doesn't exist on a national level as the current spike in COVID-19 cases has been regional. 
Biden said on Thursday that the country was losing patience with those who declined to get vaccinated, with just over 62% of Americans fully inoculated against COVID-19.
Cases of the disease remain stubbornly high in the United States, and job growth and other signs of economic health are slowing as hospitals fill up.
""COVID is new and has been a grave danger in the workplace. I think the agency is on solid legal ground here,"" said Debbie Berkowitz, a former senior OSHA official.
There is not much precedent for an emergency temporary standard.
Before the pandemic, OSHA issued only nine emergency temporary standards - and the last one was in 1983. Courts blocked or stayed four of them and partially vacated another, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. 
""It's a seldom-used approach,"" said Roger King, senior labor and employment counsel for the nonprofit Arlington, Virginia-based HR Policy Association, which examines public policy issues for large employers.
OSHA implemented an ETS in June to address COVID-19 for healthcare settings. It was challenged in court by two labor unions which wanted the standard expanded to cover other industries. 
The unions' lawsuit is ongoing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
After issuing its June emergency standard, OSHA invited comments on whether the ETS should become a final rule. The American Hospital Association urged withdrawing the standard, arguing that COVID-19 was not a grave danger at the job site since studies showed such infections were more likely to occur in the community.
U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh said in June that the standard was targeted at the most at-risk workers.
OSHA's mandate could also be vulnerable to legal challenges because months have passed since vaccines became widely available, and it may be difficult for the agency to explain why there is a grave danger now but there was not one earlier this year, said James Sullivan of law firm Cozen O'Connor, who represents employers. 
Courts also could find that the mandate’s 100-employee threshold is arbitrary, providing grounds to invalidate the rule, according to Sullivan. 
The Biden administration may be hoping that any defeat in court comes after many employers begin to comply with the rule and millions of people are vaccinated, Sullivan said.

If employers don't comply, the fines are potentially considerable, at $14,000 for each employee in violation. 
""That could result in some very nasty math,"" said Eric Hobbs, an employment lawyer with Ogletree Deakins.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Activist investor Ortelius Advisors, one of the largest owners of Capital Senior Living (NYSE:CSU) Corp, is offering to provide a near-term cash infusion as an alternative to the company's proposed fund-raising plans, which Ortelius says would harm shareholders.
Ortelius founder Peter DeSorcy has told other shareholders his firm would be willing to backstop a new equity rights offering of up to $70 million, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters.
Caligan Partners, another activist investment firm, would also be ready to participate in shoring up fresh capital, the sources said.
The offer comes roughly one month after Ortelius said it intended to block plans by the Dallas-headquartered operator of assisted living and related facilities to raise $152.5 million. At the time, DeSorcy signaled a willingness to provide a near-term cash injection.
Ortelius has also lined up a term sheet for a $46 million bridge loan for Capital Senior Living, in case the company prefers supplemental debt financing, the sources said. The terms include a lower borrowing rate than the company's proposed raise, the sources added.
“At this time Capital Senior Living has received no alternative financing proposal from Ortelius or any other party,” a spokesman for the company said. 
Ortelius recently increased its ownership of Capital Senior Living to 13%. Shareholders will vote on the financing deal on Oct. 12.
In communications with other shareholders, Ortelius said it wants the company to have options to raise a smaller amount of near-term capital now that its occupancy levels and financial position are improving.
Earlier this summer Capital Senior Living said it planned to raise capital through a private placement of convertible preferred stock to Conversant Capital, and that Conversant had agreed to backstop an associated rights offering and issue additional debt at a 15% interest rate.
Ortelius has said publicly that it opposes the ""series of exceedingly costly and highly dilutive transactions that would also effectively hand over control of the company to Conversant.""
The senior-living industry has been hit hard by the pandemic both because many nursing homes suffered COVID-19 outbreaks and because occupancy rates dropped last year.

Investing.com – Dell Technologies stock (NYSE:DELL) traded 4% higher Monday on being added to Goldman Sachs' (NYSE:GS) conviction list while the brokerage said it sees near term value.
Analyst Rod Hall sees strong cash flows and a clear road map for a debt paydown as factors pushing Dell. He put a Street-high target of $137 on the stock, an upside of 28%.
According to Hall, Dell is trading at a discount to its peers.
Dell anticipates cash proceeds of around $9.5 billion from the VMware (NYSE:VMW) special dividend post proposed spinoff and around $4 billion from the sale of its data integration company Boomi which together would help exceed its debt pay down target of more than $16 billion by the end of this financial year, the analyst wrote in his note, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst believes that once the transactions are complete, the company’s leverage will be down to around 1.3 times, which compares to the steady state leverage target of 1.5 times. This will put standalone Dell in a manageable leverage position, Hall wrote in the note, as per StreetInsider.
Dell is spinning off its 81% stake in VMware, and the transaction is likely to close next month, according to reports.

By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Emerging market firms have flocked to bond markets to cash in on low interest rates and have raised a record amount of money to fund expansion plans as they look beyond the coronavirus pandemic, data showed. Companies in developing nations have raised a record $249 billion in the first eight months of this year, overtaking the $243 billion borrowed in the same period last year, Refinitiv data shows. 
""Lower rates have been an incentive for issuers, and for investors EM high-yielding debt has been attractive, given value considerations,"" said Buddhika Piyasena, head of Asia-Pacific at Fitch Ratings. 
""There is some early refinancing happening as well, adding to volumes in 2021, with issuers wanting to take advantage of the today's interest rate environment given possible Fed moves going forward.""

Companies from India, Brazil, Thailand and Malaysian led the surge in bond sales this year. Indian firms sold bonds worth nearly $40 billion to end-August, the other three saw corporate bond sales of more than $20 billion each over the same period. 
The distribution across sectors showed energy and industrial firms in the developing world at the forefront.

Among top issuers, Qatar Petroleum (QP), one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, raised $12.5 billion for operational and investment purposes, while Saudi Arabia's Aramco (SE:2222) locked in $6 billion.
""The fundamentals of EM corporates still remain strong,"" said Chanakya Dissanayake, head of investment research at Acuity Knowledge Partners. 
Despite higher spreads, net leverage of high-yield issuers in emerging markets was around three times compared to five times for their U.S. counterparts in 2020, Dissanayake calculated. The default rate across emerging market high yield corporate debt stood at 3.5% - about half that of their U.S. peers, he added.

However, some analysts expect the borrowing bonanza might be disrupted if the Federal Reserve unwinds its monetary stimulus measures and U.S interest rates starts to rise.
In late August, U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the bank could start to dial back its massive asset purchase programme this year.
Jose Perez-Gorozpe, head of credit research for emerging markets at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, said any Fed tapering announcement would probably lead to more stringent financing conditions and volatility over the coming quarters.
""Issuers are taking advantage at still-favourable financing conditions to refinance their debt and cover future financing needs,"" he said.
Also, profits at emerging market firms are pressured as many developing economies lag the recovery enjoyed by developed markets due to slow vaccinations and less stimulus. Higher input costs and supply disruptions are also squeezing margins.
Asia's biggest firms are likely to post their first quarter-on-quarter profit decline in six quarters in July-September, falling 6.19%, showed a Reuters calculation based on Refinitiv Eikon analyst data of 1,069 companies with market capitalisation of at least $1 billion.
""Delayed economic recoveries can be especially harmful for those entities linked to tourism and related services, which have not yet recovered,"" S&P's Perez-Gorozpe said.
""In Latin America, restaurants, airlines and airports, gaming, and leisure continue to suffer from the abrupt contraction in demand last year and likely won't recover until immunisation programmes across the region.""

(Reuters) - Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc on Friday flagged a delay to its first commercial research mission with the Italian Air Force to mid-October due to a potential manufacturing defect.
The company said the delay in the mission, named ""Unity 23"" was unrelated to the pending resolution of a probe by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Virgin Galactic said on Friday a third-party supplier warned of a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control system during test flight preparations. 
""At this point, it is not yet known whether the defect is present in the company's vehicles and what, if any, repair work may be needed,"" the company said, adding it was conducting inspections with the vendor.

The mission was initially set for late September or early October to carry three paying crew members from the Italian Air Force and the Rome-based government agency National Research Council.
The FAA is investigating the flight that took billionaire Richard Branson to space in July, and last week barred SpaceShipTwo flights until the agency approves the final mishap report or determines the issues do not affect public safety.

(Reuters) -Michael Friedenberg, president of Reuters, on Monday said he will leave the company in December.
In a company memo  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp, the parent company of Reuters, said a search will begin shortly for a new Reuters president. 
Friedenberg's departure caps a three-year run that included the appointment of Alessandra Galloni, the first woman editor-in-chief at the 170-year-old news organization, the relaunch of Reuters.com and the improvement in revenue and profit at the news business this year.
It also marked the entrance of the news agency into the events business amid a global pandemic. Friedenberg's effort to launch a subscription paywall for Reuters.com in June hit a setback when Refinitiv, the largest single Reuters customer, opposed the move https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/reuters-postpones-website-paywall-amid-refinitiv-dispute-2021-05-27.
""Reuters is in an historically strong position, both editorially and commercially,"" Friedenberg, 54, wrote to his staff. ""As we look ahead, the time is right to pass on the baton – and allow a smooth transition – with Reuters firmly on the front foot.""
Steve Hasker, who became CEO of Thomson Reuters in March 2020, has said he wants to position it as a content-driven technology group. The company did not say why Friedenberg was leaving but said the news division was a core part of Thomson Reuters. 
Asked whether the company was for sale, a spokesperson said: ""Reuters is not for sale. 
""It remains an important part of Thomson Reuters and one that is valued across our business and client base. Reuters plays a central part in our overarching strategic vision to be the leading content driven technology company, powering the world’s most informed professionals."" 
Reuters.com postponed the launch of its paywall following a dispute with financial data provider Refinitiv over whether the move would breach a news supply agreement between the two companies.
The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG), the parent of Refinitiv, has said discussions with Reuters are ongoing. The group was not immediately reachable for comment on Monday.
The Thomson Reuters spokesperson said: ""Our partnership with LSEG and Refinitiv is strong, and discussions are still ongoing about our business approach and products, and how we can enhance our offer to all customers.""

In a prepared statement Hasker said: ""Reuters is delivering world-class independent, unbiased global journalism today and its next president will build on the work that Michael and his team have done.""
""We thank him for his leadership during an intense period in global affairs and express our collective appreciation to all our Reuters colleagues for their tireless efforts to inform the world.""

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:52AM ET</span>",GM digs in with LG Corp to speed a fix for Bolt battery fires,"By Paul Lienert and Heekyong Yang
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is taking a more direct role with South Korea's LG Corp, its longtime electric vehicle partner, in tracking down and fixing problems linked to battery fires in Chevrolet Bolts that threaten the strategic plans of both companies.
At an investor conference on Friday, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said LG is working with GM engineers to ""clean up the manufacturing process"" at LG battery plants and implement some ""GM quality metrics.""
Battery plants in South Korea and Michigan operated by LG Energy Solution (LGES) have been identified by GM as the source of defects behind a rash of battery-related fires in the Bolt that have triggered three recalls and $1.8 billion in warranty set-asides by GM since last November - recalls for which GM still has not implemented a hardware fix.
LGES and sister company LG Electronics on Friday reiterated their ""close relationship"" with GM and said the three companies are ""actively cooperating to come up with a final recall plan"" to ""wisely resolve"" battery issues in more than 140,000 Bolts - the entire production run since late 2016.
“Experts from GM and LG continue to work around the clock on the issues,"" GM spokesman Dan Flores said on Thursday. ""We are determined to do the right thing for our customers and resolve the problem once and for all. Once we are confident LG can provide us with good battery modules, we will begin repairs as quickly as we can.”
GM has said early Bolt models will have their entire battery pack replaced, while newer models will have only defective modules within the pack replaced. Those new parts may not be available until after November.
In the meantime, Bolt owners and prospective EV buyers have unleashed a torrent of complaints and concerns on social media aimed at both GM and LG. It is unclear how much permanent damage either company may sustain from the battery fires.
""Not even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been slowed by fires,"" said Tyson Jominy, JD (NASDAQ:JD) Power vice president of automotive data & analytics. ""I don’t expect this to slow down the EV transition much."" 
With resolution of the costly recall debacle still up in the air, relations between GM and LG have soured, people familiar with the situation said. The partners are stuck in what one Korean analyst deemed a ""show window marriage,"" one in which a divorce is unlikely as few immediate alternatives are available.
For now, GM's Michigan factory that assembles the Bolt is shut down and its 1,000 workers idled until late September.
The automaker said it has bought back some Bolts from owners and is reviewing such requests on a case-by-case basis. GM also has said it expects LG to help shoulder the $1.8 billion expense to replace Bolt battery packs. 
On Friday, GM's Jacobson said the two companies are having ""high level conversations"" about costs, and that GM expects reimbursement.
But the ultimate cost to GM and LG could be even greater. GM is ramping up a $35 billion campaign to launch a new generation of electric and automated vehicles powered by its proprietary Ultium battery technology.
The Ultium batteries GM plans to use in key electric models such as the GMC Hummer EV and electric Chevrolet Silverado are scheduled to be made with LGES in joint-venture factories in Ohio and Tennessee as part of a $4.6-billion investment program. 
But following the latest Bolt recall in late August, Chief Executive Mary Barra left open the possibility that GM could find new partners for future battery plants.
GM's Ultium cells have a different design, size and chemistry than the LG cells in the Bolt and are packaged into modules and packs in a different way.
GM executives also stress that the automaker, not LG, will control manufacturing and quality control for Ultium batteries. 
LG and its affiliates have as much at stake as GM, if not more. 
The Bolt recalls are not the only ones involving LG batteries. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co earlier this year recalled nearly 76,000 Kona Electric cars worldwide to replace defective battery modules after reports of fires linked to LG batteries made in China.
LG's signature battery technology, a thin and flexible rectangular format called pouch cells, is one of three different battery types used in electric vehicles. 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk took a jab at the GM-LG pouch cell technology in a recent tweet, writing that ""probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use."" Tesla mainly uses cylindrical cells from several sources, including some made in China by LG.

It is not clear what type of cells LGES expects to produce as part of its plan to invest another $4.5 billion in two additional U.S. battery plants. Switching battery cell technology and formats could slow the investment timetable.
On Friday, LGES told Reuters: ""We will continue to win orders and proceed (with) our investment in global markets, including the United States, as planned.""

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>","Uber drivers are employees, not contractors, says Dutch court","By Anthony Deutsch and Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Uber drivers are employees, not contractors, and so entitled to greater workers' rights under local labour laws, a Dutch court ruled on Monday, handing a setback to the U.S. company's European business model. 
It was another court victory for unions fighting for better pay and benefits for those employed in the gig economy and followed a similar decision this year about Uber (NYSE:UBER) in Britain.
The Amsterdam District Court sided with the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV), which had argued that Uber's roughly 4,000 drivers in the capital are employees of a taxi company and should be granted benefits in line with the taxi sector.
Uber said it would appeal against the decision and ""has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands"".
""We are disappointed with this decision because we know that the overwhelming majority of drivers wish to remain independent,"" said Maurits Schönfeld, Uber's general manager for northern Europe. ""Drivers don’t want to give up their freedom to choose if, when and where to work.""
The court found drivers who transport passengers via the Uber app are covered by the collective labour agreement for taxi transportation.
""The legal relationship between Uber and these drivers meets all the characteristics of an employment contract,"" the ruling said.
The FNV hailed the ruling. 
""Due to the judge's ruling, the Uber drivers are now automatically employed by Uber,"" said Zakaria Boufangacha, FNV's deputy chairman. ""As a result, they will receive more wages and more rights in the event of dismissal or illness, for example.""
Uber drivers are in some cases entitled to back pay, the court said.
The judges also ordered Uber to pay a fine of 50,000 euros ($58,940) for failing to implement the terms of the labour agreement for taxi drivers.
In March, Uber said it would improve workers' rights, including the minimum wage, for all of its more than 70,000 British drivers after it lost a Supreme Court case in February. 
Uber recorded $600 million in first-quarter charges to account for the UK benefits, highlighting the financial toll of wider changes to its contractor model. 
Unlike in other European countries and the United States, UK employment law offers a unique ""worker"" status - a legal definition that situates drivers between independent contractors with no benefits and full-fledged employees with extensive benefits.
Uber has advocated for a similar in-between status in other countries, but said those initiatives would require changes to employment laws.
Uber in February released a white paper https://www.uber.com/global/en/about/reports/a-better-deal that called on EU regulators to recognise the value of independent contracts in job creation as they consider new rules to protect gig economy workers.
""We believe a new approach is possible - one where having access to protections and benefits doesn't come at the cost of flexibility and of job creation,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a blog post at the time.
The company is pushing for similar models in the United States and Canada, where it faces dozens of lawsuits over the status of its drivers.
Uber in May faced a legal setback when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its bid to avoid a lawsuit over whether drivers are employees and not independent contractors.
But the company and other gig economy companies scored a decisive win in California last year, when a majority of the state's voters passed a company-sponsored ballot measure that cemented workers' status as contractors, albeit with some benefits.

Gig companies in some U.S. states are also trying to strike deals with labour unions.

Its shares have soared 83.1% in price over the past month to close Friday’s trading session at $2.60, due mainly to speculation that Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone will include satellite communications technology.

Furthermore, GSAT’s top line declined in the second quarter (ended June 30, 2021).

1343,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:16AM ET</span>",Column: Macro hedge funds pray for volatility to justify inflows,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Macro hedge funds drew in huge inflows and chalked up stellar returns in the second quarter, but stubbornly low volatility and an eerie calm over financial markets since then suggest they may struggle to maintain that performance for the rest of the year.
Macro funds rely on the price anomalies, widening spreads and arbitrage opportunities thrown up by high volatility and choppy trading conditions in fixed income, currencies and commodities, as well as taking big, directional bets on interest rates and exchange rates. 
It's not that macro funds have performed badly this year. Spurts of volatility in February and June helped deliver solid first and second quarters, but keeping that up through year-end will require higher volatility. 
The paradox is that volatility is stubbornly low despite unusually high uncertainty over how governments and central banks exit pandemic crisis levels of fiscal and monetary support, and how economies hold up. 
If this is true, the Federal Reserve is likely to be more cautious about dialing down stimulus and delay tapering its monthly purchases of $120 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. All else being equal, this is bad news for macro hedge fund managers. 
A strategist at one big macro fund in New York contacted last week could be speaking for the entire industry: ""I don't care where the volatility comes from, as long as we have it.""
The 'Macro Strategies' benchmark index of hedge fund industry data provider Preqin rose 6.18% in the first eight months of the year. Its 4.37% rise in the second quarter was the third highest quarterly return in at least a decade.
Similarly, HFR's macro total index was up 7.96% in the January-August period, outpacing the 5.38% gain last year and 6.50% rise in 2019. At this rate, 2021 will be the best year since 2010.
Investors are clearly getting on board. HFR data show an estimated $8.35 billion of inflows in the second quarter, the most in 10 years, while Preqin's $10.3 billion inflow was the highest by their measure since 2017.
Still, an investor putting cash into the S&P 500 index on Jan. 1 is sitting on total returns of 21% and while the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) U.S. Treasury bond index may be down 1.5% on a year-to-date basis, it is up 3% from its low in March. 
A traditional 60-40 equities/bonds portfolio is comfortably outperforming macro funds this year. A glance at the longer-term ebb and flow of volatility shows what macro funds are up against.
Take major currency markets. Refinitiv data shows the pivotal euro/dollar exchange rate is on course for its narrowest trading range in any year since its launch in 1999, oscillating in a 687-pip range between $1.1662 and $1.2349.
That is even narrower than 2019 when it meandered between $1.0877 and $1.1570, a range of just 693 pips. Three-month implied euro/dollar volatility slumped to a low at the time of 4% late that year, before dipping below 4% in February 2020 on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This gauge of volatility in the world's most important and liquid currency market fell below 5% last week for the first time since February last year.
It's a similar, though less dramatic, story in Treasuries. Implied three-month U.S. bond market volatility as measured by the MERMOVE index slumped from a pandemic peak to an all-time low late last year. It has risen since, but remains extremely low by historical standards.
Thanks to years of near-zero interest rates across most of the developed world, rates and currency market volatility has steadily been eroded. So much so that since 2012 macro funds have recorded an overall net outflow of $74 billion, according to HFR.
They will be hoping a recent pick-up in volatility due to deteriorating U.S. economic data, jitters over the Delta COVID-19 variant, and worries that Wall Street may be ripe for a correction is the start of something more prolonged.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest a turn is close at hand. They point out that periods of low volatility have become shorter over the past 20 years and the link between previous and upcoming volatility has virtually disappeared.
""Because the link between past and future volatility has weakened, investors should be cautious in extrapolating the current low volatility regime too far in the future,"" they wrote in a note last week.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",Czech gunmaker bets on riding Colt into new markets,"By Michael Kahn and Jason Hovet
PRAGUE (Reuters) - For Czech gun maker CZG-Ceska Zbrojovka Group, its recent acquisition of the Colt brand carries both the potential to become a major player in the global firearms market and the challenge of reviving the fortunes of a fabled U.S. name.
Shares of CZG, which listed on the stock market last October, have surged 60% in Prague this year as investors welcomed solid revenue growth and the company's $222 million purchase of privately-held Colt Holding Company - a deal finalised in May that will make CZG a competitor for U.S. leaders such as Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Company.
Colt, with plants in the United States and Canada, will give CZG the capacity to expand production beyond its main factory in the Czech Republic and allow it to compete in U.S. military contracts because it will fulfil ""Buy America"" regulations requiring U.S. production.
CZG says it aims to almost double CZG and Colt's pro-forma combined revenue of around $570 million last year within a few years - putting it on a par with Smith & Wesson's annual net sales of $1.1 billion in the last fiscal year. 
In 2020, the United States accounted for 66% of the Czech gunmaker's annual revenue, mainly sales to individuals and police departments of guns under its CZ (Ceska Zbrojovka), Dan Wesson and Brno Rifles brands.
""Colt is an important step in realising our vision of getting to 1 billion (euros) in revenue by the end of 2025,"" CZG's Chairman Jan Drahota told Reuters in an interview at the company's Prague headquarters. 
""We ... will be thinking how to make sure the brand is even bigger than it is now and introduce it to wider (markets).
""It is a privilege, but it is also pressure on us,"" he said. 
Some of the pressure could come from investors. The revenue target looks ambitious to some analysts and will require investment by CZG, whose roots stretch back to before World War II. 
""It is definitely an ambitious goal,"" said Pavel Ryska, analyst at J&T Banka in Prague. ""In my view, it could be met on two conditions. First, the U.S. civilian demand remains robust and keeps rising, and second, CZG adds further production capacity either through its own capex or through additional acquisitions that are well executed.""
Founded by Samuel Colt, the U.S. company produced one of the first revolvers and its single-action revolver known as “The Peacemaker” was synonymous with lawmen and outlaws in the Wild West in the 19th century. By 2015, however, the company was filing for bankruptcy protection following a series of missteps and the loss of a key contract with the U.S. Army.
Those issues allowed rivals to steal a march on Colt, although it emerged from bankruptcy in 2016 and revenue rose by a quarter last year. 
UNDERINVESTMENT
CZG, which used IPO proceeds and issued bonds to help finance the Colt deal, will outline investment plans later this year. They will include possibly introducing new products and investing in upgrades at Colt's main factory in West Hartford, Connecticut, Drahota said. 
Upgrades will also mean ""essentially an enlargement of capacity because of underinvestment in the past,"" he said.
CZG is also considering whether to produce some CZG products in the United States, he said, adding there is little overlap with Colt products.
""We have to consider from a group level what ... the production split will be at each location,"" he said. ""One plus one is more than two. We believe we can leverage on each other's success.""
About half of Colt's revenues in 2020 came from the massive U.S. military and law enforcement (M&LE) segment and Drahota said he saw ""huge room"" to grow the brand in global civilian and M&LE markets.
Analysts at Czech-based Fio Banka estimate the military and law enforcement portion of CZG's North American sales will climb to 50% from 10% with the Colt acquisition, boosting the company's revenue as M&LE firearms fall into higher price categories.
Global demand for small firearms is expected to rise from around 1.09 billion units in 2019 to 1.26 billion units in 2023, CZG said in its annual report, citing the BIS Small Arms Market Report, with the civilian market now accounting for 62% of sales and military and law enforcement 38%. 
The market's good growth prospects have helped drive shares of Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. up 21% and 16% respectively this year.
CZG, whose operating profit rose 12% last year, has until now mainly competed with European groups like FN Herstal of Belgium, Beretta of Italy and Glock Gesellschaft of Austria and struck deals last year with the Czech Army and law enforcement bodies in Brazil and Kenya, as well as contracts to help rearm Hungary's army. 
Buying Colt will also give it exposure to the UK and Canadian militaries, among others, and Drahota said the market will continue to shift to more advanced weapons as demanded by military customers. CZG, which last year took a minority stake in Spuhr i Dalby AB, a Swedish maker of optical mounting solutions for weapons, would also look at further acquisitions, especially in areas like optics or optoelectronics.

""We want to grow by acquisitions but we will be disciplined,"" Drahota said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week higher, rebounding from a week of losses amid brighter news from the pandemic front. 
The number of new Covid-19 infections fell consistently last week to be more than 10% off its peak. that has encouraged hopes that the 'delta wave' of the pandemic may soon be over in the U.S., even though deaths - a lagging indicator - are still near record levels in some parts of the country. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 291 points, or 0.8%, at 34,899 points. That was outperforming the S&P 500, which was up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite, which was up 0.1%.
Early trading was dominated by frenzied buying of uranium-themed stocks and other products, the latest Big Idea to catch the imagination of retail traders. By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) - the largest North American producer - was up 6.2%, while Uranium Energy (NYSE:UEC) was up 8.1%. Uranium futures have risen over 33% since the middle of August, as a narrative of an undersupplied global market has combined with short-term price spikes in spot power markets in Europe and North America due to low generation from renewables.
Mystery surrounded the other major news of the open, after the official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account of cryptocurrency Litecoin deleted a tweet claiming it had struck a long-term partnership deal with Walmart. While the tweet corroborated a legitimate-seeming press release issued through the Globe Newswire organization, it was not independently confirmed by Walmart, and the release also contained an erroneous email address for the supposed media contact at the retail giant. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock initially rose over 1% before retreating to be up 0.5%.
Walmart, which attracted attention to its plans for potential crypto cooperation some months back with advertisements for a project manager, subsequently issued a statement denying any linkup with Litecoin.
The incident is likely to revive debate around the inherent trustworthiness of the crypto space, at a time when U.S. regulators are making increasingly threatening noises about its accountability and reliability. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock, a rough proxy for the sector in general, fell 2.7%, The company, which crossed swords with the Securities and Exchanges Commission last week over its plans to offer a crypto lending product, had earlier announced plans to borrow $1.5 billion through a senior note issue. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 0.4% but lost some of its premarket vigor, as concerns about Friday's court ruling in favor of Fortnite publisher Epic Games continued to cast doubt over the future earning power of its app store. Both companies have said they will appeal the decision, which would allow Epic - and other game developers - to bypass Apple's payment options in future, and consequently avoid the 30% commission charged by the iPhone maker.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) -Chaotic scenes erupted at the headquarters of cash-strapped developer China Evergrande Group on Monday, as roughly 100 disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products. 
Around midday, more than 60 uniformed security personnel formed a wall in front of the main entrances to the glistening tower in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, where protesters shouted at company representatives.
""A company as big as yours, how much money has been swindled from ordinary people?"" a woman said to Du Liang, identified by staff as general manager and legal representative of Evergrande's wealth management division.
In the early hours of Monday, Du read out a proposal for repayments for holders of wealth management products, according to financial media outlet Caixin, but protesters at the company's headquarters appeared to reject it. 
""They said repayment would take two years, but there's no real guarantee and I'm worried the company will be bankrupt by the end of the year,"" said a protester surnamed Wang, who said he works for Evergrande and had invested 100,000 yuan ($15,497) with the company, while his relatives invested about 1 million yuan.
Evergrande late on Monday said online speculation about its bankruptcy and restructuring was ""totally untrue"". 
The company was facing ""unprecedented difficulties"", it said in a statement, but would do everything possible to resume work and protect the legitimate rights and interests of its customers.
Several protesters said Du had remained in the lobby overnight. He was seen sitting on the ground and slumped against a wall on Monday, visibly exhausted.
Protesters took it in turns to air grievances and at one point a woman in the crowd collapsed.
The mood was tense, with protesters attempting unsuccessfully to push through a security line blocking access to lifts. 
""Evergrande, give us our money back!"" they chanted.
Three company representatives on the scene, including Du, did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Evergrande's media relations office and police in Shenzhen did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the protest. 
The protest comes amid worries the country's most indebted developer, with liabilities of 1.97 trillion yuan ($305 billion), will be unable to repay investors and that its debt woes could pose systemic risks to China's financial system.
Some videos circulating on Chinese social media on Monday showed what were described as Evergrande-related protests elsewhere in China. Reuters could not immediately verify them.
According to Caixin, Evergrande in the early hours of Monday proposed that investors choose to accept 10% of the principle and interest of the matured product now and the rest via 10% instalments quarterly, payment by property assets, or by using the outstanding product value to offset home purchase payments. 
On Friday, Evergrande vowed to repay all of its matured wealth management products as soon as possible.
Many buyers of Evergrande-built homes have expressed concern about down-payments made for projects now suspended by the property firm, airing concerns on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).     
Hundreds of people in recent months have also protested on an online forum set up by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, seeking government help.

On Monday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange paused trading in Evergrande's May 2023 bond because of abnormal fluctuations, after it had fallen more than 30% to 53.43 yuan.

Investing.com – 3M stock (NYSE:MMM) fell 1.2%  on reports the company sees an impact at the higher end of its forecast because of the rising cost of raw materials.
The company had earlier guided for an impact of 65 cents to 80 cents on FY21 EPS because of chip shortages. In July, the company guided for a revised EPS of $9.70 to $10.10 from $9.45 at the center of the earlier range. Now, the company expects rising material prices to have a bigger effect on EPS, according to 3M Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Monish Patolawala, who spoke at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Virtual 9th Annual Laguna Conference on Monday.
According to Newsquawk, the CFO said the company is seeing broad-based inflation in resins, polypropylene, ethylene and wood pulp. Staff costs have gone up, too, he said.
The global chip shortage is also a problem. Given the shortage of chips all manufacturers -- from mobile phones to cars -- are facing, pain in the supply chain for companies like 3M could last longer. Consumers could ultimately pay in the form of higher retail prices.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",H&M lags Zara-owner Inditex in race to regain lost sales,"(Refiles to clarify time period in first bullet point)
By Corina Pons and Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM/MADRID (Reuters) - When the world's two biggest fashion groups unveil quarterly sales figures on Wednesday, No.1  Inditex  (MC:ITX) is seen back at pre-pandemic levels as stores reopen and people long to renew their wardrobe, while H&M still has some way to go. 
Fashion retailers have been recovering from the blow in 2020 from the pandemic as economies reopen and restrictions ease, although the recent spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus has caused the reintroduction of some restrictions.
Analysts said Zara-owner Inditex' recovery in the quarter probably got an extra boost from remaining best-in-class at speed and from a strong overall recovery in its core market Spain, helped also by better sales in China, where H&M has taken a hit since it expressed concerns in 2019 about alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. ""We expect Inditex to have shown the stronger sales performance over the summer, helped by its more premium positioning, fashion offer and better performance in China. However H&M’s margin and cashflow development should be strong,"" RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said.
Analysts on average see Spain-based Inditex' sales at 7.02 billion euros ($8.27 billion) in the three months through July, its fiscal second quarter, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimates, up 48% from a year earlier and 2% higher than in the same period of 2019. ""A solid quarter is anticipated,"" analysts at JP Morgan, with an ""overweight"" rating on Inditex' shares, said in a note. 
""This should be supported by lower store closures and an overall slightly improved backdrop: the Spanish clothing market noticeably improved in June, although (it) looks to have taken a step down again in July; elsewhere in Europe data shows that France improved markedly; and (a) still strong U.S.,"" they said. Inditex' sales in May and early June were twice as high as a year earlier as shoppers splashed out on post-lockdown shopping sprees. Net profit at the Spanish group is seen at 872 million euros, up 307% and up 7%, respectively. Analysts at Alantra Equities said in a note that the lifting of travel restrictions, the unwinding of remote working and the return of social events should all boost demand for fashion apparel. Still, challenges remain. Sales at British low-cost fashion retailer Primark, which does not have an online presence, fell short of management expectations in its latest quarter, its figures showed on Monday.
Swedish H&M's sales for the June-August period, its fiscal third quarter, are seen up 14% year-on-year but down 9% from 2019, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimates. Its sales statement on Wednesday comes ahead of a full-year earnings report on Sept. 30.
Industries around the world are being affected by a shortage of shipping containers and other global supply chain bottlenecks that have led to delays and soaring transport costs, but H&M and Inditex appear at little risk of empty shelves currently. 
""Neither will be immune from it, but for the rest of this year currency (a weaker U.S. dollar) should more than offset the impact from rising raw material and shipping costs on margins, while both companies are strong at securing an adequate supply of inventory,"" RBC's Chamberlain said. 
H&M's sales were hit in China where in March it was wiped off Tmall and domestic phonemakers' app stores after it in 2019 expressed concerns about alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",The unfolding of the Kansas City Southern takeover saga,"(Reuters) - Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said it planned to accept  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd's $27.2 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer as superior to its $29.6 billion deal to sell itself to Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Ltd. 
This comes after the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) rejected a temporary ""voting trust"" structure last month that would have allowed Kansas City Southern shareholders to receive the $325-per-share cash-and-stock consideration under the deal with Canadian National without having to wait for full regulatory approval. 
Below are the events that unfolded over several months as Canadian National and Canadian Pacific locked horns to take control of Kansas City Southern to create the first railway spanning the United States, Mexico and Canada, as they stand to benefit from a pick-up in trade. 
MARCH 21: CANADIAN PACIFIC AGREES TO ACQUIRE KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN
Canadian Pacific agreed to acquire Kansas City Southern in a $25 billion cash-and-stock deal, which would be the largest ever combination of North American railways by transaction value.
MARCH 22: FARM GROUPS SHOW SUPPORT FOR CP-KCS DEAL
Farm groups said Canadian Pacific's deal to buy Kansas City Southern would create a rail network from Canada to Mexico that could smooth the flow of their goods to market.
APRIL 20: CANADIAN NATIONAL TRUMPS CP'S OFFER
Canadian National offered to buy Kansas City for about $33.7 billion, trumping Canadian Pacific's buyout offer for the railroad operator. Canadian National said it was willing to match the terms of Canadian Pacific's offer for Kansas City Southern.
APRIL 21: CN KICKS OFF REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR KCS DEAL
Canadian National informed the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which oversees freight rail service and rates in the United States, that it planned to file an application, seeking permission to combine with Kansas City Southern.
APRIL 21: CANADIAN PACIFIC RULES OUT RAISING BID FOR KCS
Canadian Pacific's Chief Executive Keith Creel said the company would not raise its bid for Kansas City Southern and that bigger rival Canadian National's offer is ""not a real deal"". Creel said the company was not ready to put its ""balance sheet at risk."" 
APRIL 22: CN SHOWS CONFIDENCE IN DEAL GETTING APPROVAL
Canadian National informed Kansas City Southern's board about its confidence in winning regulatory approvals for its offer for the U.S. railroad. 
APRIL 23: LAWMAKER WARNS AGAINST RAILROAD CONSOLIDATION 
Senior U.S. lawmaker said the potential acquisition of the Kansas City Southern should set off ""alarm bells"" about industry consolidation, warning Wall Street would make money from railroad consolidation, but the U.S. economy and workforce will suffer.
APRIL 24: U.S. REGULATOR GIVES CP EARLY WIN IN TAKEOVER WAR 
The STB granted a waiver to Canadian Pacific's bid for Kansas City Southern, which means the deal would not be subjected to the tougher railroad merger rules the regulator put in place in 2001. At the same time, Kansas City Southern said its board had determined that a competing offer from Canadian National could be expected to lead to a ""superior proposal."" 
APRIL 26: RAIL CUSTOMERS PICK SIDES IN THE TAKEOVER WAR
North America's freight rail customers, from grain shippers to logistics companies, chose sides as the takeover war continued. Canadian National filed 409 letters of support with the STB, almost at par with Canadian Pacific's stated level of support. Some companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and Conagra were publicly supporting both rail bids. 
MAY 1: CP OBJECTS TO CANADIAN NATIONAL's BID 
Canadian Pacific filed a formal objection stating Canadian National's rival bid for Kansas City does not qualify to be exempted from tougher merger rules as the CN-KCS deal would greatly expand the size of the fifth largest U.S. Class 1 railroad. 
MAY 6: STB APPROVES CP'S VOTING TRUST FOR KCS DEAL
The STB approved the voting trust for Canadian Pacific's proposed acquisition of Kansas City. Canadian Pacific had earlier agreed to bear most of the risk of the merger deal not going through. Canadian Pacific was going to buy Kansas City shares and place them in an independent voting trust, insulating the acquisition target from its control until the STB cleared the deal.
MAY 13: KCS DECLARES CN BID SUPERIOR TO CP DEAL 
Kansas City Southern accepted Canadian National's bid, leaving Canadian Pacific with five business days to make a new offer. If Canadian Pacific were to table a new offer, a bidding war could ensue. 
MAY 14: DOJ SAYS CANADIAN NATIONAL BID A GREATER RISK TO COMPETITION 
The U.S. Department of Justice said Canadian National's bid for Kansas City Southern appears to pose greater risks to competition than an agreement with Canadian Pacific.
MAY 18: SHAREHOLDER URGES CANADIAN NATIONAL TO AMEND KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN DEAL
Billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hohn urged Canadian National Railway to abandon its bid for Kansas City Southern unless the Canadian railroad operator changed its agreement to drop a key feature that could invite more regulatory scrutiny.
MAY 20: CANADIAN PACIFIC ASKS KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN TO REJECT RIVAL OFFER
Canadian Pacific asked the U.S. railroad operator to reject rival Canadian National Railway's takeover offer, saying there was no longer any basis to terminate the CP-KCS agreement.
MAY 21: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN STICKS TO CANADIAN NATIONAL OFFER
Kansas City Southern reiterated that Canadian National Railway's offer was ""superior"".
MAY 26: CANADIAN NATIONAL TO DIVEST KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN'S 70-MILE RAIL OVERLAP
Canadian National Railway agreed to divest Kansas City Southern's 70-mile rail line between New Orleans and Baton Rouge to eliminate the only overlap between the two railroad operators.

AUG. 12: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN TO DELAY CANADIAN NATIONAL DEAL VOTE
Kansas City Southern said it would delay a shareholder vote on its deal to sell itself to Canadian National if the STB has not delivered its decision by Aug. 17.
AUG. 31: STB REJECTS CANADIAN NATIONAL'S VOTING TRUST STRUCTURE
STB rejected Canadian National's voting trust structure that would have allowed the railroad to proceed with its $29 billion proposed acquisition of Kansas City Southern.
SEPT. 1: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN PUTS OFF SHAREHOLDER MEET 
Kansas City Southern to adjourn a shareholders meeting that was set to vote on its deal with Canadian National Railway. The railroad operator did not specify when the rescheduled meeting would be held. Additionally, the company said it was working with Canadian National to evaluate the options available and would re-evaluate Canadian Pacific's offer.
SEPT. 1: CP CHIEF UNLIKELY TO OFFER KANSAS CITY $300/SHARE AFTER SEPT. 12 DEADLINE 
Canadian Pacific Railway CEO said the company would not be as willing to offer Kansas City $300 per share should the U.S. railroad operator's board fail to decide on the offer by its Sept. 12 deadline.
SEPT. 4: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN TO BEGIN TALKS WITH CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY
Kansas City Southern said it will initiate talks with Canadian Pacific as CP's unsolicited proposal to acquire it could reasonably be expected to lead to a better proposal than one made by Canadian National Railway.
SEPT. 7: CANADIAN NATIONAL SHAREHOLDER TO NOMINATE FIVE DIRECTORS TO COMPANY'S BOARD
Billionaire Chris Hohn's TCI Fund Management said it intends to nominate directors to replace about half of Canadian National's board, after its costly attempts to buy Kansas City Southern were dealt a blow by the U.S. regulator.

SEPT. 12: KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN PLANS TO ACCEPT CANADIAN PACIFIC'S BID
Kansas City Southern said it planned to accept Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd's $27.2 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer as superior to its $29.6 billion deal to sell itself to Canadian National Railway.

Investing.com –  Coinbase Global  stock (NASDAQ:COIN) was a little volatile in early trade, weaker by 0.5% as of 9:45 AM ET in Monday’s premarket as the company said it plans to raise $1.5 billion in debt.
The company said the proceeds will go into product development, acquisitions of other companies, products, or technologies that it may identify in the future.
The fund-raise will bolster its balance sheet with low-cost capital, the company said.
The notes will be due in 2028 and 2031 and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Coinbase Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The crypto exchange plans to grow the number of assets listed on its platform, with Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong stating that he wants Coinbase to be the ""Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of assets"" and list every legal crypto asset on its platform, according to a Reuters report earlier.
The company was in the news last week when the SEC threatened to sue it if it went ahead with its plans to enter the business of crypto lending.
Armstrong went public with his grouse against the regulator, tweeting, “If you don't want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry,” he tweeted while pointing out that plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer the lending feature”.

1354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",Evergrande Crisis Escalates as Protests Break Out Across China,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group is facing mounting protests by homebuyers, retail investors and even its own employees, raising the stakes for authorities in Beijing as they try to prevent the property giant’s debt crisis from sparking social unrest.
Police descended on Evergrande’s Shenzhen headquarters late Monday after dozens of people gathered to demand repayments on overdue wealth management products. Protesters numbered in the hundreds on Sunday, Caixin reported. 
Evergrande told employees at its office in Shenyang, near the border with North Korea, to work from home after staffers who bought the company’s WMPs staged a protest over the weekend, a person familiar with the matter said. In Guangzhou, angry homebuyers surrounded a local housing bureau last week to demand Evergrande restart stalled construction.
Unconfirmed videos of protests against the developer in other parts of China were being shared widely on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), the country’s popular microblogging platform. There’s no indication that any of them have turned violent. 
The latest uproar follows Evergrande’s proposal late last week to impose lengthy repayment delays on holders of WMPs, the lightly regulated investment vehicles that have become a key source of funding for the developer. While Evergrande tweaked its plan on Monday in an attempt to mitigate the backlash, retail and institutional investors will still face delays unless they accept repayment in the form of Evergrande-developed properties.
Small-scale protests over troubled investment products aren’t unheard of in China, but they’re rare enough to attract attention from authorities who put a premium on social stability and have little tolerance for unsanctioned gatherings. 
Whether they prompt Xi Jinping’s government to change tack on Evergrande remains to be seen. China’s top financial regulator signed off on the developer’s plan to renegotiate payment deadlines with banks and other creditors in August, a person familiar with the matter said last week. It’s unclear if officials had given explicit guidance on WMPs.
Evergrande didn’t respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
With more than $300 billion in liabilities, the developer has become one of the most systemically important companies in China. On top of its obligations to WMP investors and bondholders, it owes about $147 billion in trade and other payables to suppliers and received down payments on yet-to-be-completed properties from more than 1.5 million home buyers as of December.
Evergrande’s bonds are pricing in a near-certain likelihood of default, with its dollar note due 2022 falling by about 2 cents to 31 cents on Monday. 
The developer has said it’s exploring the sale of interests in its listed electric vehicle and property services units, as well as other assets, and seeking to bring in new investors and renew borrowings. It’s also discounting properties aggressively to boost sales, with mixed success. Contracted sales, including those to suppliers and contractors to offset payments, tumbled 26% last month from a year ago. 
Evergrande said in August it was forced to suspend work on some projects due to overdue payables. The company’s billionaire founder, Hui Ka Yan, pledged to complete projects this month, issuing what he called a “military order” to ensure property construction and delivery.
Evergrande proposed three repayment options for WMPs on Monday, according to two investors who were informed by their product managers and asked not to be identified. They included repayment through cash installments, properties or investors’ payables on residential units they have already purchased, the people said. 
Retail investors can choose to be repaid 10% of their principal and interest every quarter, starting the final working day of the month due.
The new proposal treats all investors equally, in contrast to an interim plan released late last week that prioritized smaller investors, according to people familiar with the matter. 
When Evergrande stopped repaying some investors last Thursday, those holding less than 100,000 yuan ($15,488) were to be paid in full and those with exactly 100,000 yuan were to get half back, according to two investors briefed earlier. Those holding more than 100,000 yuan were to see payments extended by two to four years and amortized.
Apart from the cash option, the new plan allows investors to purchase Evergrande’s residential units, offices, stores and parking units at deeper discounts to offset wealth products due. If investors have bought Evergrande’s residential units by Sept. 12, they can also request to use the money they’re owed to offset payments. Details are still pending for the second and third option.
Evergrande doesn’t disclose details of its WMP issuance, making it difficult to gauge the size of its outstanding products.
A local TV station in Anhui province reported that thousands of people in the province hold overdue Evergrande WMPs that total between 1.3 billion and 1.8 billion yuan, citing a wealth management consultant at Evergrande named Liu Yuntin. The consultant said 70% to 80% of Evergrande’s own employees in Anhui purchased such products and that’s likely to be the situation for branches nationwide.
Evergrande repeatedly told staff that it would be responsible for interest and principal and that Hui Ka Yan himself would guarantee payments, Liu said.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bombardier set to launch updated version of Challenger 350 private jet- sources,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) is launching an updated version of its strong-selling Challenger 350 corporate jet with a redesigned interior, as more wealthy travelers seek to fly private during the COVID-19 pandemic, sources familiar with the matter said.
Canada's Bombardier is expected to announce its first update of the Challenger 300 family since the 350's launch in 2014 at a virtual event on Tuesday. 
Challenger 350, which seats up to 10 passengers and lists for $26.7 million, remains one of Bombardier's best-sellers, with fleet operator Flexjet ordering 40. 
But with only limited upgrades over the last seven years it risked losing ground to rivals in a market where wealthy buyers demand the latest features, analysts said.
""You need to keep programs going,"" said business aviation analyst Rolland Vincent. ""You have to keep ahead of the game.""
Corporate planemakers often choose to refresh or update existing models with new features instead of producing new clean-sheet designs that are more costly and time-consuming to bring to market. It's not clear when the refreshed Challenger model would be available or how much would it cost.
Bombardier declined comment ahead of Tuesday's virtual event.
The pandemic has fuelled demand for corporate and private jet travel in the United States, with a shortage of pre-owned business jets and demand from wealthy travelers to fly with fewer people on a private plane underpinning prices and filling order books for new corporate aircraft.
The refurbished launch is critical to Bombardier, which has turned into a pure-play business jet manufacturer, after selling its train business to  Alstom  (PA:ALSO). It generated revenue of $6.5 billion in 2020 and plans to grow by focusing on its Challenger and Global jets.
The revamped plane's interior will borrow unspecified elements from the planemaker's flagship Global 7500 ultra long-range jet, and come with autothrottles, an automated power control system, said two sources who spoke anonymously to discuss the private matter.
Challenger is the market leader in the super-midsized business jet category, which bridges small corporate planes and large-cabin aircraft for 13 to 19 travelers, but faces competition from U.S. and Brazilian rivals.
It competes with  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ),  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) among others in a corporate jet market which generated more than $17.2 billion in deliveries among the top players in 2020.
They include Textron's Cessna Citation Longitude which entered service in 2019, and Embraer's Praetor jets which are longer-range variants of the Brazilian planemaker's mid-sized Legacy line. 
""That space has become quite busy"" Vincent said.

Bombardier said it would generate higher revenue and use less cash in 2021, helped by a rebound in business jet flights.
According to FlightAware data, business aviation traffic in the United States, the largest market for corporate aircraft, grew 16% on average between August 22 and 29, compared with the same dates in 2019, underscoring the sector's recovery.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>",Sydney Airport sale a step closer after improved $17.4 billion offer,"(Corrects typo in the dateline)
By Jamie Freed and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -A sale of Australia's biggest airport moved closer on Monday as an infrastructure investor group won permission to conduct due diligence on Sydney Airport Holdings Pt Ltd, after sweetening its takeover offer to A$23.6 billion ($17.4 billion).
The move sent the airport's shares up 5%, with analysts saying a rival bid appeared unlikely given the scale of the funding needed and foreign ownership rules that mean the airport must remain 51% Australian owned.
""We assign a high probability of a deal succeeding given the board's commitment to unanimously recommend the (consortium's) offer if there is no alternative higher offer,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said in a note.
Sydney Airport is Australia's only listed airport operator and a purchase would be a long-term bet on the travel sector which has been battered by the pandemic. The country plans to gradually open its borders once 80% of adults are fully vaccinated, a milestone expected by the end of the year.
A successful takeover would be among the largest buyouts ever of an Australian firm and underline a year of stellar deal activity, that has already seen a mega $29 billion buyout of Afterpay by Square.
The improved offer of A$8.75 a share - an increase of 3.6% - follows prior proposals from the consortium pitched at A$8.45 and A$8.25, both of which were rejected by the airport operator's board as inadequate.
Sydney Airport shares were trading at A$8.40 on Monday morning, below the offer price, due to the length of the time the transaction will take to complete as well as the limited prospects for a rival bid.
""An alternative bidder appears highly unlikely,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Anthony Moulder said in a note to clients.
The bidding consortium, Sydney Aviation Alliance (SAA), is comprised of Australian investors IFM Investors, QSuper and AustralianSuper and U.S.-based Global Infrastructure Partners.
Record-low interest rates have prompted pension funds and their investment managers to chase higher yields. Australia's other major airports are unlisted and owned by pension funds and infrastructure investors.
SAA has been granted non-exclusive due diligence that is expected to take four weeks after signing a non-disclosure agreement, Sydney Airport said. 
If SAA makes an acceptable binding proposal, the current intention is for the board to recommend it in the absence of a superior offer, the airport operator added.
UniSuper, Sydney Airport's biggest shareholder with a 15.3% stake, said it was open to rolling that equity into an investment in the privatised company, as required as part of the bid conditions.
""The price represents a very full valuation for the airport, particularly given the uncertain medium-term outlook for international travel,"" UniSuper Chief Investment Officer John Pearce said in a statement.
The deal will require an independent expert's report, approval from 75% of shareholders and a green light from the competition regulator and the Foreign Investment Review Board, in a process that typically takes months to complete.
Jamie Hanna, deputy head of investments at VanEck, said he believed SAA would consider increasing its bid after examining the airport's books given the improving travel outlook.

An SAA spokesperson said the consortium welcomed the announcement and looked forward to working with Sydney Airport's board to finalise the transaction.

AIR said it updated its insured loss estimates after analyzing the inland flood impacts across Hurricane Ida's track, including in the Northeast states. 
AIR had earlier estimated insured losses, including wind and storm surge, in the range of $17 billion to $25 billion from the deadly hurricane.
Included in the estimates are losses to onshore residential, commercial, industrial properties, and automobiles for their building, contents, and time element coverage, AIR said. 
Losses do not include any estimate of losses from the National Flood Insurance Program, or any losses from offshore assets, it added. 

The industry loss estimates also reflect an adjustment to account for increased material and other repair costs in the current construction market, AIR said, adding costs remain they about 30% higher.
The loss bill from Ida is still likely to be far less than the $87 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when adjusted for inflation, according to experts.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Android app makers suing to stop Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from siphoning up to 30% of their sales received little reassurance about their chances on Friday as a judge allowed a comparable fee charged by Apple Inc to stand.
Developers including ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games in the last year took aim at the two biggest mobile app stores, run by Apple and Google. The critics view the fee as needlessly high, costing developers collectively billions of dollars a year, and a function of the two big tech companies having monopoly power.
Google's trial is at least a year away, time both sides could use to hone arguments based on the Apple decision, legal experts said.
In a ruling on Friday following a trial between Epic Games and Apple, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) required Apple to let developers tell customers about ways to pay outside of its App Store, leading Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) to fall 3.3%. Alphabet dropped 1.9%.
Google's Play store employs rules similar to the ones struck down in the Apple case, limiting developer communications with their customers, and Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Google could be at risk, too. He also noted the remaining risk of new regulatory action by lawmakers.
But Gonzalez Rogers allowed to stand requirements that developers bemoan even more. Those rules, including that in-app payments be made on Apple's own system, allow the company to collect its 15-30% fee. 
Apple General Counsel Katherine Adams told reporters that her company was ""extremely pleased."" Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that, ""Today's ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers.""
Vanderbilt Law School professor Rebecca Haw Allensworth said she agreed Gonzalez Rogers' findings were discouraging for the case against Google, while Valarie Williams, an antitrust partner at law firm Alston & Bird, said Google ""will likely be encouraged by the ruling.""  
The judge said the Apple restrictions allow users to rest assured that the apps they buy for the most part are free of viruses and pornography and that what they paid for will be delivered.
""App distribution restrictions increase security in the 'broad' sense by allowing Apple to filter fraud, objectionable content, and piracy during app review while imposing heightened requirements for privacy,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote.
Apple's fee leads to ""extraordinary profits,"" according to her ruling. But if she forced Apple to ease restrictions, the company might struggle to gain any remuneration for providing a platform to developers, she said. Apple's selling point to consumers about having strong security and a centralized system also would be undermined, the judge added. 
Its 30% rate, she said, was set ""almost by accident when it first launched the App Store"" rather than as a result of market power.
Google has made similar arguments of privacy and security benefits as justification for its rules and fee, and it has long followed Apple's lead on commission levels, Google documents revealed in lawsuits show.
With Google's smaller share in the U.S. mobile app market, plaintiffs may have to reframe arguments to succeed against Google. Gonzalez Rogers said Epic's challenge of any commission at all was an unreasonable position versus Apple, and that Epic failed to offer clear evidence of the iPhone maker being a monopolist. 

Tweaked arguments may not be enough. The case against Google has been more difficult from the start. Google makes it possible to install apps from other sources, taking away from the monopoly argument. It also historically has been more lenient in enforcing some of its policies.
Google, Epic and attorneys for other developers suing the Play Store operator declined to comment. Utah's attorney general, which is helping lead a related lawsuit by U.S. states, said it is reviewing the judgment.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>","In fresh regulatory move, China tells tech giants to stop blocking rivals' links","BEIJING (Reuters) -China fired a fresh regulatory shot at its tech giants on Monday, telling them to end a long-standing practice of blocking each other's links on their sites or face consequences.
The comments, made by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) at a news briefing, mark the latest step in Beijing's broad regulatory crackdown https://www.reuters.com/world/china/education-bitcoin-chinas-season-regulatory-crackdown-2021-07-27 that has ensnared sectors from technology to education and property and wiped billions of dollars off the market value https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-crackdown-wipes-hundreds-billions-off-top-companies-values-2021-09-13 of some of the country's largest companies.
China's internet is dominated by a handful of technology giants which have historically blocked links and services by rivals on their platforms. 
Restricting normal access to internet links without proper reason ""affects the user experience, damages the rights of users and disrupts market order,"" said MIIT spokesperson Zhao Zhiguo, adding that the ministry had received reports and complaints from users since it launched a review of industry practices in July. 
""At present we are guiding relevant companies to carry out self-examination and rectification,"" he said, citing instant messaging platforms as one of the first areas they were targeting.
He did not specify what the consequences would be for companies that failed to abide by the new guidelines.
The MIIT did not name any companies, but the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper reported on Saturday https://m.21jingji.com/article/20210911/herald/b269ce2ecca9eb2ace240aac04d564b3.html?skinTheme=0 that  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd were among the firms told to end the practice by an unspecified time last week.
Shares in Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings fell on Monday by over 6% and 3% respectively against a 3% decline in the Hang Seng Tech Index.
COMMON PRACTICE
The practice targeted by the MIIT is common.
Tencent restricts users from sharing content from ByteDance-owned short video app Douyin on Tencent's instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ. In February, Douyin filed a complaint https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bytedance-idUSKBN2A2153 with a Beijing court saying it constituted monopolistic behaviour. Tencent has called those accusations baseless. 
In other cases, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce marketplaces do not allow Tencent's payment service WeChat Pay to be used as a payment option. 
Tencent said it supported the MIIT's guidance and would make the necessary changes in phases. Alibaba said it would comply with the MIIT requirements and ""looked forward to finding common ground with other platforms.""
ByteDance ""called on all Internet platforms to take action, not make excuses, clarify timetables and actively implement them to provide users with a safe, reliable and convenient network,"" it said in a statement.
Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina, said: ""Forced cracks in China's walled gardens has the potential to re-write China's digital advertising and e-commerce landscapes,"" said 

""In the short term, all eyes will be on Tencent as it comes to grips with what it means to open WeChat to Alibaba and ByteDance,"" he said. 
The MIIT also said on Monday that China had ""too many"" electric vehicle (EV) makers and the government would encourage consolidation.

Investing.com – MiMedx stock (NASDAQ:MDXG) plunged by more than 52% in Monday’s premarket after the scandal-plagued company suffered setbacks in two late-stage musculoskeletal clinical trials.
The company said in a regulatory release that its key product - the dehydrated Human Amnion Chorion Membrane (mdHACM) - failed to meet critical endpoints in two separate clinical trials: a Phase 2B trial for the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) and a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of Plantar Fasciitis (PF).
The findings do not support an application for a biologics license in the latter case, it added. The company said it will still pursue phase-III KOA confirmatory studies.
The results are a body blow for a company that has been overshadowed by the past wrongdoings of its previous management. Former chief executive Parker Petit and chief operating officer William Taylor was sentenced to a year in jail in Februaryy after being found guilty of inflating the company's financial statements in the middle of the last decade. The fraud had come to light in the course of a bitter public fight between Parker and short-sellers led by Mark Cohodes.
MiMedX's product pipeline had enough support on Wall Street and in financial media such as Bloomberg Opinion to fuel a 65% rally this year. 
""If the $MDXG products do not work, as evidenced by the two failed clinical trials announced this morning, then the years of arguing are done, right?"" tweeted Stat News's Adam Feuerstein.

The company, which rivals Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM), said it would sell 28.5 million shares priced between $28 and $32. At the top end of the range, it will raise $912 million. 
The San Mateo, California-based firm joins a slew of listings from the software and technology sector. Most such debuts have seen strong interest from market participants who expect the companies to benefit from the shift to hybrid work following the pandemic.
Founded in 2010 by Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy, Freshworks was launched from the South Indian city of Chennai. It raised its first round of funds in 2011 and in the same year it bagged its first customer - the Atwell College in Australia.
Venture capital firm Accel and New York-based technology investment giant Tiger Global Management were the early investors in the company.
Freshworks has a suite of products that help businesses with customer management like a messaging platform and an artificial-intelligence-powered chatbot for customer support.
It was valued at around $3.5 billion during its last funding round in November 2019. Sequoia Capital India and CapitalG are also its backers. 
Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-salesforce-rival-freshworks-hires-banks-ipo-sources-2021-04-27 in April that a stock market debut could value Freshworks at around $10 billion. 
Its technology is used by more than 50,000 companies in 120 countries, including high-profile names like Delivery Hero SE, Vice Media and Swedish payments firm Klarna. 

Freshworks will list its stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""FRSH"".
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P. Morgan, Bofa Securities are lead underwriters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Breeze Airways, the new U.S. carrier founded by entrepreneur David Neeleman, on Monday publicly unveiled an order for 20 more Airbus A220-330 aircraft as it looks to operate longer flights, confirming a Reuters report earlier this year.
The order brings Breeze's total A220 order to 80, making it the family's second-biggest customer after Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and leapfrogging Neeleman-backed JetBlue.
Breeze is Neeleman's fifth commercial airline and is injecting new competition into a battered airline market as U.S. domestic travel recovers from the coronavirus crisis.
It began operations in May using Embraer regional jets and plans to start using the new, Canadian-designed A220 on routes longer than two hours’ flight time from early 2022.
""This just shows growth is on the way,"" Neeleman told Reuters in an interview after confirming the purchase, which involved the exercising of purchase options.
Reuters reported in April that Breeze had placed an order for 20 Airbus A220 jets, bringing its total to 80, but that the name of the buyer was being withheld - a common practise as airlines polish tightly held marketing plans..
Airbus confirmed that the order announced on Monday was already on its books in the undisclosed buyer column.
Breeze will take delivery of its first A220 next month, on October 26. After that, Breeze will take delivery of a total of 80 A220s at one per month for the next six and a half years. 
Airbus said the A220 aircraft would be delivered from its Mobile, Alabama, assembly line.
Last month, Breeze Airways' parent company closed a $200 million Series B funding round led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Knighthead Capital Management LLC.
Breeze Aviation Group had previously raised more than $100 million. 
Breeze currently serves 16 U.S. cities and nearly 40 routes.
Using 13 Embraer aircraft, it has set its sights on linking smaller U.S. cities with little or no direct service from larger carriers, including Tampa, Florida or Norfolk, Virginia.

Neeleman, who has founded a string of airlines including JetBlue and Canada's WestJet, said he also expects to acquire about a half-dozen additional Embraer planes next year.
He said Breeze's bookings are ""a little softer"" in the near-term because of COVID-19, but look stronger further out. ""The virus has probably taken 10% out of the bookings,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - California companies added Latino directors at the slowest pace among U.S. minority groups, a new study found, ahead of a year-end state deadline mandating more boardroom diversity.
Although many companies pledged a new effort to diversify their workforces and leadership after last year's Black Lives Matter protests, the new figures show little has changed in some quarters.
Among the roughly 1,443 new directors added to public company boards in California during the 12 months ended June 30, just 49 of them, or 3.5%, were Latino or Hispanic, the review found. 
By contrast, 10% of new directors were Black or African-American, and 18% were Asian, according to the study. It found 83% of the state's public company boards had no Latino or Hispanic directors.
""We've been overlooked,"" said Kathy Munoz, a vice-president at the Latino Corporate Directors Association, which authored the study using data from researcher Equilar Inc. ""We're not getting the visibility that other communities are getting.""
The association's vice-president for research, Ozzie Gromada Meza, and various Latino business leaders blame outdated executive recruiting efforts and insular social and professional networks for the gap in representation.
Boardroom diversity is closely watched in California, the most populous state and the headquarters of many top technology and entertainment companies. 
As of June 30 Latinos held just 2.5% of board seats in the state overall, the study found. New Census data shows Latinos and Hispanics made up 39.4% of California's population and are the largest ethnic group. 

A recent state law required companies to have at least one woman on their boards, and women now hold 28% of the 5,831 total directorships at public companies based there.
A similar law now requires California companies by the end of 2021 to have at least one director from an ""underrepresented community"" including people who self-identify as Black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian or LGBT.

In a late-Friday filing for the $5.7 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW)), the firm tweaked the fund’s prospectus to include reference to holding exposure to cryptocurrencies via “exchange-traded funds domiciled in Canada.” 
The move comes after the $1.3 billion Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), a blockchain-focused product, was last week shown to have a tiny stake in three Canadian Bitcoin ETFs.
Investors and issuers in the $6.8 trillion U.S. ETF market are still waiting for regulators to approve exchange-traded products investing in cryptocurrency. While Canada and Europe have raced ahead, a huge backlog of applications has built up with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ark is among those in line, having teamed up with Switzerland-based 21Shares AG to file plans for a fund in the U.S.
ARKW already boasts some Bitcoin exposure -- about 5.5% of the fund is invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The $30 billion vehicle is arguably one of the easiest ways for investors to access cryptocurrencies in the U.S. via a fund, but its structure makes it inefficient and its value frequently detaches from that of the Bitcoin it holds. 
As of Friday, GBTC was down about 20% since the first Canadian Bitcoin ETF launched in February. That fund, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) has dropped 9%. ARKW has lost about 6.5% since then, but is still up 2.3% year-to-date. It has lured about $691 million in new cash in 2021.
A spokesperson for Ark didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the documentation changes.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s venture capital arm has invested millions of dollars in Oculii, a U.S. startup maker of software for radar sensors used in self-driving cars, Oculii co-founder Steven Hong said.
GM can use Oculii's low-cost software to boost the resolution of radars and scale up its partially automated vehicles and full self-driving cars, he told Reuters in an interview.
The investment is a ""fantastic signal they're serious about the technology and bullish about radar in general,"" said the Stanford University graduate who founded Oculii with his father, Lang Hong, an engineering professor at Wright State University.
He declined to disclose the financial details.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eliminated radar sensors from its volume models this year, rekindling questions about the safety and performance of its advanced driver assistant system.
Radars, which measure the distance between objects, enable a car to accelerate or brake to match its speed with that of the vehicle in front. Radars also work well in adverse lighting and weather conditions.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has called additional sensors like lidars and radars ""crutches,"" doubling down on cheaper cameras and artificial intelligence for its driving automation system.
Hong said he agreed with comments by Tesla's artificial intelligence director, Andrej Karpathy, about the shortcomings of traditional radars. Karpathy said in June that radars sometimes make ""dumb"" measurements of the environment, holding back its vision system.
""Traditional radar is very low resolution and very noisy,"" Hong said. But high-resolution radars are a key backup to cameras and other sensors when they fail, thus providing ""extra safety,"" he added.

He said he expected Tesla to embrace radars as prices decline.
""It is gonna be a no brainier,"" Hong said.

Reuters reported on Sunday that U.S. House Democrats would propose raising the corporate tax rate to 26.5% from 21% as part of a sweeping plan that includes tax increases on the wealthy, corporations, and investors.

After incorporating tax reform into its models, Goldman analysts said they expected S&P 500 earnings of $212 per share in 2022, which is below the consensus estimate of $220.35 for Wall St shown by Refinitiv IBES data.

Investing.com – ViacomCBS stock (NASDAQ:VIAC) traded 1.8% higher in Monday’s premarket on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the company is separating the movie and television businesses as part of a broader revamp at its Paramount Pictures unit.
Nickelodeon chief Brian Robbins will oversee films while ViacomCBS veteran David Nevins adds oversight of the Paramount TV unit to his existing responsibilities, according to WSJ. Both will report to ViacomCBS Chief Executive Robert Bakish, the report said.
Nevins oversees premium cable channel Showtime and original content for the Paramount+ streaming platform.
Paramount TV is expected to focus on making content for its sister cable and streaming networks, the WSJ said. Paramount TV currently makes shows for Apple's TV+ (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)."
1374,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 07:13AM ET</span>",Dow Futures 200 Pts Higher; Optimism Over Covid Cases Helps,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, rebounding after recent weakness on the back of positive Covid-19 news and encouraged by signs that Democratic lawmakers may be scaling down their plans to raise taxes.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 200 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.6%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 80 points, or 0.5%.
Helping the tone Monday was the news that Covid-19 cases appeared to be declining across the country, with the 7-day average through Friday dropping to 136,000, from 157,000 at the end of August, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   
The three major indices fell last week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 2.2% and the S&P 500 falling 1.7%, both recording five straight days of losses for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%, its worst week since July.
These losses may be relatively small given the gains the indices have enjoyed over the last year, but there are signs overall confidence may be weakening as central banks consider scaling back economic stimulus amid concerns over rising inflation - even as growth starts to moderate.
At the same time, global authorities appear to be flexing their muscles, be it Chinese regulators taking on their tech behemoths, the U.S. courts forcing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to allow app developers to send users to other payment systems, or the U.S. Democrats proposing a series of levies on wealthy individuals and companies.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, with the main focus being on Tuesday’s release of consumer price inflation. In July, price increases slowed but remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis, while producer prices recorded on Friday the biggest annual increase since records were first kept in November 2010. 
In corporate news, Uber (NYSE:UBER) will be in the spotlight after a Dutch court ruled that drivers are employees of the company and not independent contractors, while Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) has reached a new agreement to acquire Mexican concert promoter OCESA Entretenimiento for about $450 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Crude prices advanced Monday, posting a one-week high, with supply from the important U.S. Gulf of Mexico region still impacted by the damage from Hurricane Ida more than two weeks after the event.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected later Monday to release its latest monthly assessment of worldwide conditions, with the global growth of Covid-19 cases likely to weigh on their future demand prediction.
By 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $70.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $73.46. Both contracts reached their highest level since Sept. 3 earlier in the session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,790.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1775.

Shares were up about 1% before the opening bell on Monday. They had closed down 3.3% on Friday.
The court issued a permanent injunction that would let app developers route players to alternative platforms to make payments, allowing them to avoid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 30% App Store fees.
Analysts said that while the ruling had the potential to eat into Apple's services revenue, a big driver of growth in recent years, any hit was still unclear, would be spaced out in time and liable to be only a small fraction of overall income. 
""In the end, I expect this to have at most a 2% headwind to overall revenue and 4% to earnings,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at tech-centric VC firm Loup Ventures. 
""After the first year of these changes, app store growth rates will return to normal. Bottom line, it's at most a one year headwind and does not change the big picture of where Apple is going over the next 5 years.""

Wedbush analysts also estimated that in a worst case scenario, Apple would lose roughly 3% of total revenues and would be closer to about a 1% revenue and profit headwind over the next few years, given a vast majority of consumers will continue to use the App Store for in-app purchases.
On Sunday, Epic said in a legal filing that it plans to appeal a ruling in the antitrust case.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 06:52AM ET</span>",Volkswagen's China partners bristle as carmaker lavishes love on new venture,"By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is in talks to tighten its grip on a majority-owned joint venture in China, sparking tensions with the German automaker's other Chinese partners who fear they could be sidelined, sources familiar with the matter said.
The world's second-biggest carmaker secured a controlling 75% stake in a venture with China's JAC in 2020 after Beijing relaxed rules that had previously barred foreign firms from owning majority stakes in local auto companies.
Volkswagen, which took control of one of JAC's plants in the eastern city of Hefei last year, is now in talks to buy another as part of a big expansion in electric vehicles (EV), three sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
That has rattled Volkswagen's other Chinese partners, SAIC Motor and FAW, which want the German group to commit more models to their own ventures, sources at Volkswagen, the Chinese firms and joint ventures told Reuters.
The stakes are high. Boosting its majority-owned business would mean Volkswagen wouldn't have to share so much profit with state-run partners and can accelerate its EV push without having so many partner negotiations in the world's biggest car market. 
But the German group can't afford a false step, as it now makes about 40% of sales and half of its profits in China - mostly through its ventures with SAIC and FAW.
In a sign of its ambitions, Volkswagen is planning to relocate hundreds of Beijing-based staff to Hefei, according to Volkswagen sources and a memo seen by Reuters. Beer gardens are being set up around the Hefei plant to create a German atmosphere for its employees.
JAC's chairman Xiang Xingchu said last year it expected the joint venture to make 200,000-250,000 vehicles in 2025 and 350,000-400,000 in 2029. 
Volkswagen told Reuters the venture's portfolio would not directly compete with those of its other joint businesses in China, but would rather be complementary. 
""The investment is a long-term strategic decision as we expect the total market in China to grow to around 30 million units by 2030,"" it said. That includes more than 12 million new energy vehicles, up from the 1.4 million sold last year.
FAW, JAC and SAIC declined to comment. Volkswagen has a 50-50 venture with SAIC, and holds 40% of its venture with FAW. 
Separately, Volkswagen is also considering producing light duty trucks in China, possibly at a revamped JAC truck plant, two of the sources said. 
The sources cautioned Volkswagen has not made decisions on these plans and they are subject to change. The German group declined to comment. 
Selling its Hefei plant would leave JAC only making passenger cars under the Sihao marque in nearby Anqing city, one of the sources said. 
The Chinese company, whose parent group is owned by Volkswagen and local government, still makes trucks and vans under its own brand.
TENSIONS
Volkswagen is the most successful foreign automaker in China, selling around 3.85 million vehicles there last year despite the pandemic. That compares with General Motors (NYSE:GM)' 2.9 million vehicles and Toyota's 1.8 million.
""It's fair to say that without VW, the Chinese autos industry wouldn't exist as we know it today and vice versa,"" Bernstein analysts said in a recent a research note.
""No global OEM (original equipment manufacturer) is bigger in China and has leveraged the benefits more than VW. China was (and remains) the source of about 50% of VW's earnings and cash flows.""
In its early years, Shanghai-based SAIC-Volkswagen helped Volkswagen break into the market with local production of the Santana sedan in 1985. 
FAW-Volkswagen, meanwhile, made Audi the first locally-produced premium car model in China, grabbing orders from the government and leading its competition with BMW and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).
At their height, Santana and FAW-Volkswagen's Jetta and Citroen Fukang - compact sedans together known as the ""old three"" - made up a majority of China's car market in the 1990s.
SAIC-Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen are now seeking assurances their businesses won't suffer as Volkswagen looks to step up investment in Hefei, five of the sources said. 
""We laid good ground for Volkswagen in China so it cannot abandon us in the future,"" one senior FAW source said.
Tensions between the partners are not new. 
Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess riled SAIC in 2019 when he told the media he planned to increase stakes in Chinese ventures. 
SAIC responded that any major decision related to the joint venture required discussions by both partners and it was ""disappointed"" Volkswagen would announce such an important issue without coordinating with it. 
The Chinese firms frequently ask for more models to boost their ventures, and negotiations have not always been smooth. 
SAIC said publicly in both 2018 and 2019 that its MEB factory would make electric Audi cars. However, Volkswagen was then not fully on board with the plan, sources said, although there have been signs of progress recently.
A filing by China's industry ministry last month showed an electric Audi SUV, similar in size to Volkswagen's ID.6 7-seat electric model, was pending regulatory approval.
FAW, meanwhile, has pressed Volkswagen for a standalone electric venture in which Audi would hold a 75% stake and FAW 25%. However, three of the sources said the project was struggling to pass Volkswagen's internal feasibility review. 

""Two old partners keep asking for more models that we cannot satisfy. This is torturing,"" one senior Volkswagen executive said. Volkswagen now has over 50 models in China. General Motors has 60, including many mini-van models, and Toyota around 20.

Investors purchased a net $8.54 billion in global equity funds in the week, a 54% drop compared with the net buying in the previous week. 
Concerns over the spread of the delta variant of COVID-19 and its impact on the economic recovery weighed on investor sentiment last week.
Also, markets were assessing data showing the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in seven months in August and wondering how the U.S. central bank will respond. 
European equity funds attracted an inflow of 9.17 billion, while U.S. and Asian equity funds had outflows. 
Within sector funds, inflows into healthcare and tech funds dropped sharply, while financial and industrial sector funds faced outflows.
Meanwhile, global money market funds secured a net $22.17 billion, after seeing two weeks of outflows, underscoring the risk-off sentiment during the week.
Global bond funds saw inflows for a seventh straight week, obtaining $11.73 billion.
Global inflation-protected bond funds lured a net $1.4 billion, the largest in five weeks.
Among commodity funds, precious metal funds faced outflows worth $116 million after seeing inflows in the previous week, as gold prices dipped to a two-week low last week. 

Energy funds also witnessed outflows for a fourth successive week. 
An analysis of 23,907 emerging market funds showed bond funds attracted $1.21 billion and equity funds received a net $973 million, each marking a second weekly inflow.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is on course to recoup at least some of its Friday losses, a day ahead of a promotional event for its new iPhones.
The stock traded nearly 1% higher in Monday’s premarket after shedding 3.3% in the previous session due to an adverse ruling in the company's dispute against Epic Games, the publisher of Fortnite and other titles. The judge ruled that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from providing links or other communication that direct users away from its in-app purchasing service. 
Epic wanted to link back to its own app store on iPhones, which would allow it to duck paying a fee to Apple. The fee is anywhere between 15% and 30% per transaction. The game publisher gave consumers the option to buy Fortnite cheaper directly from its website. Apple removed the game from its store, which eventually led to Epic filing the lawsuit. 
Both companies have said they will appeal Friday's ruling, Epic adamant that it didn't go far enough in its critique of Apple. 
Attention in the short term is now turning to Apple's annual September event, which will present this year's hardware updates. New versions of the iPhone, the Apple Watch and Airpods are in the list of expected items.
The company is pinning its hopes for this year on the rollout of 5G networks, which Apple hopes will trigger a wave of upgrades to new devices among consumers.
A report in The Wall Street Journal said the new iPhones are “expected to be more evolutionary than revolutionary”.
According to FactSet data, Apple is on pace to sell a record 239 million iPhones in the financial year that ends later this month, a 27% rise from last year."

Britons have become increasingly aware of the amount of plastic they use in recent years, with television documentaries such as naturalist David Attenborough's ""Blue Planet II"" particularly highlighting the dangers of plastic pollution to marine life. 
In response, supermarket chains and consumer goods groups are increasingly testing refills in a drive to cut single-use plastics. 
Through a partnership with Loop, the global reusable packaging platform, customers in 10 Tesco stores in eastern England will be able to buy products in reusable packaging that can be returned to stores when finished so it can be cleaned, refilled and used again. 
A range of 88 products will be offered, including brands such as Unilever’s Persil laundry detergent and Radox shower gel, PZ Cussons’ Carex handwash, Fevertree drinks, Heinz ketchup, Coca Cola, Tetley Tea and Brewdog beer, as well as 35 Tesco own-brand essentials, such as pasta, rice, sugar and oil.
In June, Asda, Britain's third-biggest grocer, extended its trial of a refill scheme after sales of several products in an initial pilot store outsold packaged alternatives. Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), Morrisons and Waitrose have also been trailing concepts. 
Tesco said it will add more products to its scheme throughout the year and the trial would be scaled-up if it proved successful. 
“We are determined to tackle plastic waste and one of the ways we can help is by improving reuse options available to customers,” said Tesco Chief Executive Ken Murphy. “We’ll learn as much as we can from this to inform our future packaging plans,” he said. 
The Loop platform was launched in 2019 in Paris and New York. 
The launch of Loop in Tesco stores followed a year long online pilot that began in July 2020.

Tesco said prices for the contents of each item are comparable to the original. A fully refundable deposit starting at 50 pence (70 U.S. cents) is paid on each reusable product at the store checkout, refunded via an app when the customer returns the packaging to a collection point in store.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture, which will be partly state-owned, the newspaper https://on.ft.com/3ElGHtw reported, citing two people familiar with the process.
State-backed firms are set to take a sizeable stake in Ant's credit-scoring joint venture for the first time, three people told Reuters last week. 
The partners plan to establish a personal credit-scoring firm wherein Ant and Zhejiang Tourism Investment Group Co Ltd will each own 35% of the venture, while other state-backed partners, Hangzhou Finance and Investment Group and Zhejiang Electronic Port, will each hold slightly more than 5%, said one of the people.
According to the FT report, Ant will not be China's only online lender affected by the new rules. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for a comment. 

In April, Chinese regulators asked Ant to conduct a sweeping business overhaul, include turning Ant itself into a financial holding firm, and fold its two lucrative micro-loan businesses Jiebei and Huabei, into the new consumer finance firm.
Chinese regulatory authorities have been targeting Ant Group and other internet ""platform"" giants in a wide-ranging crackdown encompassing antitrust and privacy issues, user data and cryptocurrencies.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",Marketmind: September setback,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
After seven straight months of gains, world stocks are enduring a dismal September, touching a 2-1/2-week low on Monday. 
Wall Street futures are higher but the S&P 500 witnessed its first five-day decline since February last week and Treasury yields posted their third weekly gain, the longest streak since mid-March. 
These losses admittedly are small but a sign that unease is building over several issues. 
First, it looks like politicians, regulators and judges are not in a forgiving mood -- Asian shares have lost ground over an FT report that payments app Alipay, owned by Jack Ma's Ant Group, is now in Beijing's crosshairs. 
It comes after Friday's U.S. court ruling forcing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to allow app developers to send users to other payment systems. 
U.S. Democrats will propose a series of levies on wealthy individuals and companies, Reuters reported on Sunday.
Then, even as central banks mull exiting pandemic-era stimulus, the growth rebound may be softening; oil producers' group OPEC is preparing to cut oil demand forecasts for 2022.
Inflation meanwhile is proving less transitory than thought. U.S. and Chinese factory gate inflation at decade-highs, data on Monday showed galloping wholesale prices in Japan and inventory levels worldwide well below normal. Consumer and wage inflation could well be next. 
Still, lets not lose track of market positives. 
There's plenty of cash around, and it's showing up in abundant dealmaking; an improved 3.3 billion-euro bid from Hellman & Friedman for pet supplies retailer Zooplus, a $27.2 billion offer for U.S. railroad firm Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and a $17.4 billion sale of Sydney airport are some of the transactions in the news.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
-Japan's wholesale inflation hovered near a 13-year high in August
-AB Foods raises profit outlook Czech payments firm Eurowag plans to list in London
-Norwegians begin voting in election centred on oil, equality
-Germany's Social Democrats increase lead over the conservative CDU, polls show

According to the report, conducted from Sept. 7-9 and covering over 550 market professionals globally, 58% of respondents said they expected an equity sell-off by the end of the year. 
Helped by vast amounts of stimulus from central banks, stocks have surged from the lows they reached in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic spooked markets and triggered a sharp drop in equities. The MSCI world equity index has nearly doubled since then.
Economic growth and corporate profits have recovered faster than expected, but now data from the United States and China suggests that recovery may be running out of steam.
COVID-19 was still considered the biggest risk to market stability, with 53% of Deutsche Bank survey participants citing concerns over new virus variants that bypass vaccines. This was followed by higher-than-expected inflation.
Around a third of respondents (32%) cited strong economic growth not materialising or being short-lived, and a central bank policy error, as risks to market stability.
The September survey also showed that belief in transitory inflation - as flagged by central banks - is edging down though it still remains the consensus.
Banks including BofA,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) last week told clients to trim exposure to stocks.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said in a client note last week that it expects the S&P 500 to be at its current level at the end of the year.
""Given the risk of higher taxes and interest rates, we are broadly neutral on US equities and see more upside in European stocks,"" BNP Paribas said.

Deutsche Bank also polled market professionals about their intentions to return to work following the pandemic and found that around one in five people still had not returned to their office since March 2020, when the pandemic triggered lockdowns globally. 
This number was even lower in the United States at one in three, Deutsche Bank said.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Monday, with investors buying into the idea of a strong economic recovery in the region following last week’s European Central Bank policy decision.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%.
The ECB decided last week it was in a position to slow down its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, and at the same time it raised its growth and inflation projections for this year and beyond as the Eurozone economy recovers quicker than expected.
Still, ECB President Christine Lagarde was eager to stress that the move wasn’t the start of tapering, suggesting the central bank’s monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to come.
That said, investors will focus on comments from the Chief Economist Philip Lane, in particular, this week for more insights into the thinking at the central bank.
The latest inflation releases from the U.K. and the U.S. on Tuesday will also be studied carefully.
In corporate news, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock rose 1.1% after the British engineering company announced plans to sell its stake in AirTanker Holdings, the owner of 14 A330 refuelling jets, for 189 million pounds ($261 million), in its latest disposal aimed at reducing debt.
Zooplus (DE:ZO1G) stock jumped 7.8% after Hellman & Friedman raised its takeover offer for the German online pet supplies' retailer, while Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY) stock dropped 2.9% as quarterly sales at its key Primark unit were lower than expected.
These gains in Europe came despite losses in Asia earlier Monday, following news of fresh regulatory crackdown on Chinese firms. Additionally, Chinese property developer  Soho China  (HK:0410) slumped after a takeover deal by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) fell through, while the Financial Times reported Beijing is considering breaking up Alipay, the payments app owned by Ant Group.

The MSCI Asia-Pacific index is up just 3.37% this year, compared with the MSCI United States' gain of 19.7% and MSCI Europe's 12.9% this year. 
The Asia-Pacific index has, however, gained 4.4% in the past two weeks, on rising hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to delay the start of tapering its asset purchases and maintain its expansive monetary policy for the near-term.
""U.S. equities had an incredible run so far leading to almost 35% premium over Asian equities, higher than the average discount over the past 20 years,"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for APAC at DWS. 
""We could see a reverse in trends next year with the rest of world moving towards tighter monetary policy driven by strong recovery and inflationary pressure while China increases fiscal spending with more liquidity provision.""
Some analysts said Asian stocks are attractive at these levels and could stage a turnaround due to the recent pick up in vaccinations and a rise in domestic consumption levels in the region.
""Asian equities are under-owned by institutional investors. Within EM, investors are underweight EM Asia and overweight Latin American equities,"" said Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""Given Asia's stronger growth outlook, listed presence of tech and consumer megatrends and lower balance sheet risk, such a stance in favour of Latin America is surprising to us,"" he said.""

Once India's biggest private carrier, Jet stopped flying in April 2019 after running out of cash, owing billions to lenders and leaving thousands without jobs.
The defunct airline had said in June that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved a resolution plan submitted by a consortium of London-based Kalrock Capital and UAE-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan.
The bankruptcy court's go-ahead came several months after Jet's creditors had given their approval in October last year to the resolution plan submitted by the consortium.

Investing.com -- European stock markets are expected to open in a subdued fashion Monday, with investors looking for direction following the European Central Bank’s policy decision and ahead of key inflation data.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%, but CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2%.
The ECB decided last week to slow down its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, citing higher inflation and stronger gross domestic growth within the region.
ECB President Christine Lagarde was eager to stress that the move wasn’t the start of tapering, but investors will focus on comments from the Chief Economist Philip Lane, in particular, this week for more insights into the thinking at the central bank.
The timing of when central banks choose to scale back economic stimulus is a key driver of market sentiment, and with this in mind the latest inflation releases from the U.K. and the U.S. on Tuesday will be studied carefully.
Ahead of that, the handover from Asia was generally negative Monday, with Chinese electric vehicle stocks hit hard after the country’s industry minister said consolidation in the sector was needed.
Additionally, Chinese property developer Soho China slumped after a takeover deal by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) fell through, while the Financial Times reported Beijing is considering breaking up Alipay, the payments app owned by Ant Group.    
Crude prices advanced Monday, posting a one-week high, with supply from the important U.S. Gulf of Mexico region still impacted by the damage from Hurricane Ida more than two weeks after the event.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected later Monday to release its latest monthly assessment of worldwide conditions, with the global growth of Covid-19 cases likely to weigh on their future demand prediction.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $70.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $73.52. Both contracts reached their highest level since Sept. 3 earlier in the session.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,793.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1794.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 01:46AM ET</span>",Factbox-China crackdown wipes hundreds of billions off top companies' values,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's regulatory crackdown has ensnared sectors from technology to education to property, wiping hundreds of billions off the market capitalisations of some of its largest companies and putting investors on alert over who may be next.
Here are some of the largest names that have been affected so far:
ALIBABA GROUP
The woes of China's biggest e-commerce company began in late 2020 when China abruptly suspended the record $37 billion stock market debut of its financial affiliate Ant Group and later fined  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) $2.75 billion for abusing its market dominance. 
The company's U.S.-listed shares have shed more than $400 billion in value since late October, when its founder Jack Ma made a speech that blasted China's regulatory system, which is widely regarded as the trigger for the government backlash that followed. 
Alibaba's sprawling empire of businesses has continued to face heat from regulators, over issues ranging from their use of algorithms, to consumer privacy and worker protections. 
TENCENT HOLDINGS
China's largest gaming and social media company has lost more than HK$2.7 trillion ($347.13 billion) in market value since its shares reached an all-time high in mid-February. 
The company has been fined for failing to report past deals to anti-trust regulators, its $5.3 billion plan to merge China's top two videogame streaming sites was blocked and it has been barred from entering music copyright agreements. 
Tencent has also been affected by China's latest efforts to combat gaming addiction among minors. In August under-18-year- olds were banned from playing video games for more than three hours a week.
DIDI GLOBAL
China's largest ride-hailing company became the target of a cybersecurity investigation by Chinese authorities days after its New York initial public offering in June, who ordered its app to be removed from Chinese app stores and barred it from registering new users. 
Its shares have lost about $37 billion, or more than 40%, of their value since it raised $4.4 billion from its June 30 IPO. 
The company has also been criticised by state media over how it pays its drivers. Reuters has reported that Didi is in talks with state-owned Westone Information Industry Inc to handle its data management and monitoring activities.
MEITUAN
The food delivery company became the target of an antitrust probe in April and experienced a sell off in its shares a month later after its founder and Chief Executive Wang Xing posted an ancient poem on social media that was perceived by some as criticising the government and President Xi Jinping.
Meituan, whose share have lost more than HK$1.2 trillion ($154.28 billion) in value since reaching their all time-high in February, has also been criticised on other matters, including treatment of its delivery riders and violation of consumer rights. 
NEW ORIENTAL EDUCATION & TECHNOLOGY GROUP
China's largest provider of private educational services has seen the market value of its U.S.-listed shares fall by $7.4 billion since July, when Beijing issued new rules barring for-profit tutoring on the school curriculum. 
Beijing wants to ease pressure on school children and reduce a cost burden on parents that has contributed to a drop in birth rates but analysts warn that the new rules threaten to decimate the country's private education sector. 

The company and its peers have been since trying to promote alternative classes such as drama and even parental training.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's stock investors have raised bets Taro Kono will become the country's next prime minister, snatching up renewable energy and office technology shares that are expected to benefit under his economic policies.
At the same time, investors are now trimming holdings of some medical service shares that had previously benefited on now fading expectations former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, an advocate of spending in that sector, could succeed outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
Weekend polls showed vaccine minister Kono emerging as a strong favourite to become the next leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and therefore prime minister, well ahead of Kishida and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba.
While there are few specific details about each candidate's economic platforms, investors are nonetheless positioning themselves ahead of the Sept. 29 LDP vote.
""Some foreign investors are buying Japanese stocks on Kono hopes,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Asset Management. ""But his economic policies are still not that clear, including his stance on the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, so there is a risk markets may get disappointed.""
Kono is known as a critic of nuclear power and investors expect him to promote a further shift to renewable energy given Japan last year adopted a carbon neutral goal.
His improved political prospects since the start of the month have pushed renewable energy firm Renova up 47% over that period while rival West Holdings has gained 26%, easily beating 6.5% gains in the broad Topix index. 
LDP leadership race and Japan stocks https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykgkelvg/21913B.png 
Similarly, Kono, as administrative reform minister, has spearheaded efforts to abolish the use of ""hanko"" seals, personal signature stamps traditionally used for managerial approval and seen as a symbol of Japanese corporate inefficiency.
His improved chances supported firms that provide document digitalisation services. Bengo4.com, which offers electronic contract service, has risen 8.4% so far this month while GMO GlobalSign, a web certificate service firm, added 9.7%.
Kishida's chances were undermined after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, one of his main backers, switched his support to lesser-known former home affair minister Sanae Takaichi.

Kishida has pledged to expand the country's medical capacity to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak so his candidacy and initially strong support helped shares in that sector.
However, his subsequent loss of momentum has hit those shares with Leoclan, a medical equipment trading firm, shedding some of its gains of more than 20%. MRT, which offers web-based staffing service for doctors and hospitals, also lost steam.

Investing.com –  Soho China  Ltd.'s (HK:0410) Hong Kong shares plummeted after a $3 billion takeover bid by Blackstone Group Inc. (NYSE:BX) ended in failure.
Shares plummeted 34.86% to HK$2.28 ($0.29) by 1:02 AM ET (5:02 AM GMT) on Monday, after falling up to 40% earlier in the session.
Blackstone’s decision against moving ahead with the acquisition was Soho’s second failed attempt in selling itself. Progress in satisfying Blackstone’s preconditions of the offer was insufficient, Soho said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday in explaining the reason behind the failure.
On the market since early 2020, Soho was banking on profits from a sale to help ease the pressure from a lack of new pipeline assets and declining office rents in key Chinese cities on its profits. It is also dealing with an intensifying crackdown on developers that are leaving them with a tight liquidity position.
Blackstone made an offer to acquire Soho for as much as HK$23.7 billion or $3.05 billion, subject to regulatory approval, in June 2021. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation formally accepted the deal for review in August 2021.
The HK$5 per-share offer in June, representing a 31.6% premium, was announced by Blackstone in June 2021. Blackstone and Soho concluded that the pre-conditions could not be satisfied before the long-stop date, but the date would not be extended, the statement said.
Founded by Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Officer Zhang Xin in 1995, Soho’s key assets include the Bund SOHO and Wangjing SOHO office buildings in Shanghai and Beijing respectively."

The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people, plunging Boeing into a financial crisis, which has since been compounded by the pandemic.
In August, India's air safety regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, said it cleared 737 MAX aircraft to fly with immediate effect, after nearly two-and-a-half years of regulatory grounding.
SpiceJet said in August it expected the grounded 737 MAX jets in its fleet to return to service at the end of September after a settlement with lessor Avolon on leases of the aircraft.
The lifting of the ban in India came months after the aircraft returned to service in the United States and Europe. More recently grounding orders were lifted in other countries, including Australia, Fiji, Japan and Malaysia.
The resumption of MAX aircraft services would be subject to regulatory approvals https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/481721b3-6aca-4ef7-a16f-c9b0d41c0132.pdf, SpiceJet, India's second-largest airline by market share and the only one in the country to fly the aircraft, said.

China is the biggest market in the region that has yet to approve the return of the 737 MAX, though Boeing last month conducted test flights in the country.
SpiceJet's shares were up 0.3% on Monday, while rival Indigo's owner InterGlobe Aviation was down nearly 2%.

The judge on Friday said Apple would have to loosen some rules on developers. But the ruling favored Apple on many counts, including allowing the iPhone maker to continue its prohibition of third-party, in-app payment systems.

It also allowed Apple to continue to charge commissions of 15% to 30% for its own in-app payment system. Epic had said it would continue its legal fight.
Analysts said the impact may depend heavily on how Apple chooses to implement the judge's decision. Apple's critics and rivals said they are more likely to turn to legislators, rather than courts, to pursue the changes they seek. Both Apple and Epic declined to comment on Sunday.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>","Factbox-Chevrolet Bolt fires date back to early 2019, GM says","(Reuters) - One of the earliest battery-related fires in a Chevrolet Bolt electric car was reported 18 months ago. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) did not open a formal investigation on Bolt fires until August 2020. A year later, GM launched its third recall, covering all Chevy Bolts built, to replace potentially defective batteries. Here is a chronology leading up to the August 2021 recall, compiled from documents submitted by GM to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:
March 17, 2019 - One of the first reports of a battery-related fire in a Chevrolet Bolt involves a 2018 model in Belmont, MA, as GM later confirms to NHTSA.
Aug. 26, 2020 - GM has received reports of 12 Bolt fires, confirming that at least five are battery-related, and opens a formal investigation.
Oct. 9, 2020 - NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation opens a preliminary evaluation on 2017-2020 Bolts after the agency receives two complaints and reports of three fires and one injury. 
Nov. 5, 2020 - GM recalls 50,932 2017-2019 Bolts to address the risk of fire in batteries made at partner LG Chem’s Korea plant. As an “interim remedy,” GM dealers will install a software update that limits the battery charge to 90%. GM tells dealers to stop the sale of new and used Bolts until the software update is available.
April 29, 2021 - GM describes a “final” remedy: Dealers “will perform a diagnostic procedure and, if necessary, replace battery module assemblies that fail the diagnostics.” Dealers also will install advanced onboard diagnostic software that can predict potential issues related to battery charge.
July 14, 2021 - GM learns of battery fires in two Bolts that had received the “final” remedy. It advises owners of 2017-2019 Bolts to park their vehicles outdoors immediately after charging, and not to leave their vehicles charging overnight.
July 17, 2021 - GM orders a second safety recall of the same 2017-2019 Bolts.
July 21, 2021 - GM and LG identify “the simultaneous presence of two rate manufacturing defects in the same battery cell as the root cause of the battery fires.”

Aug. 6, 2021 - GM becomes aware of a Bolt fire “outside of the recall population” and identifies the battery pack as a probable cause. GM tells dealers that “the required repair to complete the recall is not yet available.”
Aug. 20, 2021 - In the third recall in nine months, GM calls back all remaining Bolts made through model year 2022, as well as the new Bolt EUV. A final fix is not yet available.

By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) -Yet another billionaire entrepreneur is set to ride into space this week, strapped inside the capsule of a SpaceX rocketship as part of an astro-tourist team poised to make history as the first all-civilian crew launched into Earth orbit.
Jared Isaacman, the American founder and chief executive of e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments, will lead three fellow spaceflight novices on a three-day trip from blastoff at Cape Canaveral, Florida, to splashdown in the Atlantic.
The 38-year-old tech mogul has plunked down an unspecified but presumably exorbitant sum for fellow billionaire and SpaceX owner Elon Musk to fly Isaacman and three specially selected travel mates into orbit aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.
The crew vehicle, dubbed Resilience, was set for liftoff from NASA's Kennedy Space Center atop one of Musk's reusable Falcon 9 rockets, with a five-hour targeted launch window that opens at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT) on Wednesday.
Forecasts on Sunday predicted a 70% chance of favorable weather conditions for launch, organizers said, on a flight directed entirely from the ground. 
A successful flight could spawn a new era of commercial space tourism, with several firms vying for wealthy customers to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of supersonic travel, weightlessness and the visual spectacle of space.
Setting acceptable levels of consumer risk in the inherently dangerous endeavor of rocket travel is also key, and raises a pointed question.
""Do you have to be both rich and brave to get on these flights right now?"" Sridhar Tayur, a professor of operations management and new business models at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, asked in an interview with Reuters on Friday.
The so-called Inspiration4 mission was conceived by Isaacman mainly to raise awareness and support for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center.
He has pledged $100 million personally to the institute.
BEYOND THE BILLIONAIRE SPACE RACE
SpaceX is easily the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA.
Rival companies Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both recently celebrated their debut astro-tourism missions with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 and Jeff Bezos https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-blueorigin-idAFKBN2EQ0EP, each going along for the ride.
But those two high-profile flights were suborbital in scale, sending their crews of citizen astronauts to space and back in a matter of minutes. 
The SpaceX flight is designed to carry its four passengers where no all-civilian crew has gone before, into Earth orbit.
There, they will circle the globe once every 90 minutes at more than 17,000 mph (27,360 kph), or roughly 22 times the speed of sound. The target altitude is 575 kilometers, or nearly 360 miles, beyond the orbits of the International Space Station or even the Hubble Space Telescope.
Like Blue Origin, the 20-story-tall SpaceX launch vehicle and crew capsule will take off vertically from a launch pad on a flight directed entirely from the ground.
Branson's suborbital rocket plane, by contrast, had two highly trained pilots at the controls as it carried its four rear-seat passengers 50 miles (81 km) high.
The Inspiration4 crew will have no part to play in operating their spacecraft, despite some largely honorary titles, though two, Isaacman and geoscientist Sian Proctor, are licensed pilots.
Isaacman, who is rated to fly commercial and military jets, has assumed the role of mission ""commander,"" while Proctor, 51, once a NASA astronaut candidate herself, has been designated as the mission ""pilot.""
She was selected to join the team through an online contest run by Shift4 Payments.
Rounding out the crew are ""chief medical officer"" Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a bone cancer survivor turned St. Jude physicians' assistant, and mission ""specialist"" Chris Sembroski, 42, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aerospace data engineer.
Sembroski won a seat in a sweepstake that drew 72,000 applicants and has raised more than $100 million in St. Jude donations.
The four crewmates have spent five months making rigorous preparations, including altitude fitness, centrifuge (G-force), microgravity and simulator training, emergency drills, classroom work and medical exams. 
SpaceX and the crew planned a full dress-rehearsal of launch-day activities at the Cape on Sunday night, to be followed by a final ""static"" test firing of the rocket's engines, organizers said. 
Inspiration4 officials stress that the mission is more than a joyride.
Once in orbit, the crew will perform medical experiments with ""potential applications for human health on Earth and during future spaceflights,"" the group said in media materials.

Appearing in a promotional clip for a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) documentary series on the mission, Arceneaux said a big part of her motivation was to kindle hope in her cancer patients.
""I'm getting to show them what life can look like after cancer,"" she said.

The administrators of HNA’s debt restructuring program have decided to bring in Liaoning Fangda Group Industrial Co. as the strategic investor for the airline business and Hainan Development Co. for the airport unit, according to exchange filings Sunday. 
“The fact that HNA has finally found strategic investors months into its debt restructuring process is significant progress to creditors,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Dan Wang said. 
Understanding How China’s HNA Group Rose and Fell: QuickTake
The restructuring aims to help Hainan Airlines Holding Co. and HNA Infrastructure Investment Group Co. reduce debt and improve profitability, the two companies said in their filings. There is still a risk of bankruptcy or delisting if their financial results don’t meet regulatory requirements, they said, without elaborating. 
Hainan Airlines’ shares slid 4.8% early Monday in Shanghai, their biggest drop in five weeks, while HNA Infrastructure tumbled 5%, the biggest loss since May 31. 
HNA hopes the restructuring plan will be approved by Chinese court before the end of October, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people briefed by administrators. Hainan Airlines and HNA Infrastructure both plan to issue new shares to the investors. 
Hainan Airlines will hold its second creditors’ meeting to review the restructuring plan on Sept. 27, and HNA Infrastructure’s creditors’ meeting will be convened the next day, according to statements to the exchange. 
Headquartered in Beijing, Liaoning Fangda’s businesses include carbon and steel manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and finance. It holds four companies listed in mainland China and has a workforce of more than 60,000. Hainan Development is owned by the government of Hainan, the southern Chinese island province where HNA is based. Its Chairman Gu Gang heads the workforce on HNA, which took over the group’s management in February last year.

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said the regulator was not satisfied that the public benefits of the proposed joint business agreement would outweigh harm to competition.
""Preserving competition between airlines is the key to the long-term recovery of the aviation and tourism sectors, once international travel restrictions are eased,"" he said in a statement. 
The agreement - which would allow the airlines to coordinate fares and schedules - would make it very difficult for other airlines to operate on routes between Australia and Japan, ACCC said.
Japan's ANA Holdings is the only other airline that flies non-stop between Japan and Australia.
""Virgin Australia told the ACCC that it would be more difficult to enter the Australia-Japan route if it is required to compete with Qantas and Japan Airlines acting jointly rather than as individual competing airlines, "" the regulator said. 
After a negative draft decision by the ACCC in May, Qantas had offered to commit to a new service between Cairns and Tokyo once demand thresholds were reached.
Qantas and JAL expressed disappointment with the ACCC decision in a joint statement on Monday, though they said they would continue their codeshare arrangements and oneworld alliance partnership.

Qantas domestic and international chief executive, Andrew David, said the decision was unfortunate for Cairns, because without the ability to coordinate with JAL, the planned Tokyo flights would not be commercially viable.
JAL senior vice president Ross Leggett said the joint venture with Qantas would have accelerated the recovery of leisure and business traffic between Japan and Australia.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Stakeshop Pty Ltd, an online stock broker backed by tech investment giant Tiger Global, said on Monday it will launch a A$3 ($2) brokerage service in Australia, the country's cheapest.
The launch is a direct challenge to No. 1 lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY)'s subsidiary CommSec, the country's largest online and mobile broker, and other large competitors that have dominated the local market for years.
""I don't think there's been material change in the industry since brokerage went electronic in the late '90s and early 2000s,"" said Matt Leibowitz, Stakeshop's Sydney-based founder and chief executive. ""So I think 25 years on, this is a big moment.""
Operating as Stake since 2017, the company is known among a growing number of investors in Australia and New Zealand primarily as a commission-free retail broker for U.S.-listed stocks.
For that service, Stake's platform operates in U.S. dollars and traders are charged 0.7% on fund transfers between Australian and U.S. dollars.
It has about 360,000 customers, and trading on the app has grown 100-fold to over $1 billion per month since its launch, Leibowitz said.
The brokerage for Australian-listed stocks will be powered by Finclear, a broker-dealer 16% owned by Magellan Financial Group. 
Trading in stocks listed on the local ASX Ltd exchange will be CHESS-sponsored, meaning that it will be under the person's own name, not a separate legal entity's name, as is commonly done by low-cost brokers seeking to reduce costs.
After a commission-free period until year end, Stake's commissions of A$3 a trade will compare to CommSec's tiered fees of A$10 to $29.95 for each trade worth up to A$1,000 to A$25,000, respectively.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",Kansas City Southern plans to accept Canadian Pacific's $27 billion bid,"(Reuters) -Kansas City Southern said on Sunday it planned to accept  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd's $27.2 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer as superior to its $29.6 billion deal to sell itself to Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Ltd.
Canadian National now has until the end of Friday to submit a better offer or lose its deal with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU). At stake is the creation of the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
Kansas City Southern's change of heart came after the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) rejected a temporary ""voting trust"" structure last month that would have allowed Kansas City Southern shareholders to receive the $325-per-share cash-and-stock consideration under the deal with Canadian National without having to wait for full regulatory approval. 
Canadian Pacific has had its proposed voting trust cleared by the STB. The regulatory certainty this provided convinced Kansas City Southern's board to switch to a deal with Canadian Pacific, even though its offer was lower than Canadian National's, according to people familiar with the deliberations.
There is a silver lining for Kansas City Southern. The Canadian Pacific offer it now plans to accept, worth $300 per share in cash and stock, is better than the $275 per share cash-and-stock deal that the two companies had clinched in March, before Canadian National gatecrashed it and entered into an agreement with Kansas City Southern in May.
Were Canadian National to lose out to Canadian Pacific, it would receive from Kansas City Southern a $700 million break-up fee and would be reimbursed for another $700 million it paid Kansas City Southern to pass on to Canadian Pacific as a break-up fee for terminating their March deal. Canadian Pacific has said it will cover the cost of this $1.4 billion that Kansas City Southern would owe Canadian National.
Canadian National has also faced pressure from some of its investors, including hedge fund TCI Management Ltd, to abandon its pursuit of Kansas City Southern. 
Canadian National did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its next steps. 
The STB said last month that even though the overlap of Canadian National's and Kansas City Southern's networks was confined to 70 miles (113 km) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, the two railways operated parallel lines in the central portion of the United States and could be under less pressure to compete if the voting trust for that deal was approved. It added that it was not making a final determination on whether the competitive issues that the deal faced could be resolved under a full regulatory review. 

U.S. President Joe Biden has issued sweeping executive orders aimed at promoting competition in the U.S. economy. One order encouraged the STB to consider Amtrak's statutory rights when assessing whether a rail merger is in the public interest.
Passenger railroad Amtrak, majority owned by the U.S. government, had opposed the Canadian National's voting trust, saying its pledge to divest the Baton Rouge to New Orleans line will harm future passenger service in Louisiana.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",Investors eye wobbling energy sector as gauge for Delta fears,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Energy stocks are becoming a popular bellwether for concerns over how deeply the Delta variant of the coronavirus is expected to impact the U.S. economy, as the so-called reopening trade that boosted some parts of the market earlier this year continues to stumble.
The S&P 500 energy sector is down 12.3% for the quarter-to-date compared with a 3.7% gain for the S&P 500, which stands near record highs. That contrasts with the sector’s performance in the first quarter of the year, when it zoomed 29.3% on expectations that a vaccine-fueled economic rebound will boost energy demand. 
The decline, which has outstripped a 2% fall in the price of Brent crude, suggests some investors believe the U.S. economic recovery may have peaked in the face of a coronavirus resurgence, leading them to focus on a looming unwind of the easy money policies that have helped the S&P more than double since its March 2020 lows. 
Other reopening plays such as airlines and hotels have also stumbled, as investors rotated back into the high-growth technology stocks that have led the markets for years. The S&P technology sector is up 6.8% this quarter.
""The rise of the number of cases of the delta variant has led to a resumption of the outperformance of stay at home defensive stocks like tech,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). ""You're seeing reopening stocks underperform significantly."" 
Investors will get additional readings on the health of the U.S. economy next week with the release of consumer price index figures, retail sales, and a measure of consumer sentiment. 
For now, many are gauging to what degree a slowing economic bounce could impact asset prices. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cited concerns about slowing growth when it lowered its recommendation on U.S. equities in the past week, while economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut their estimate of U.S. economic growth in the third quarter to 5.5% from 9% in late August.
Those worries have weighed on energy stocks, with companies like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) down more than 13% for the quarter-to-date. 
""It's definitely been a painful trade the last couple of months,"" as investors moved out of crowded positions in energy stocks that rallied at the start of the year, said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist for Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. 
Some investors, however, remain bullish on energy out of expectations that eventual declines in coronavirus case counts will buoy economic growth.
Melson has been increasing his positions in energy stocks because believes that growth will continue to be comparatively robust, leaving the economy expanding at a level that will support oil prices.
Overall, price values in the energy sector appear to reflect oil prices at $50 per barrel, well below their current level of $72.50 for brent oil, said Ben Cook, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy BP (NYSE:BP) Energy Transition Fund, who has been adding to his positions in large oil producers. 
The mismatch, he believes, leaves “very little downside risk in the stocks once you start to see some relief from these fears that are permeating the sector."" 
""As the global consumer reverts back to previous pattern of economic activity there will be a supply base that will have a tough time meeting demand,"" Cook said.
The declines have also made some energy stocks much cheaper relative to their values earlier in the year. Exxon, for instance, now trades at a forward-price-to-earnings ratio of 12.6, compared to 30.9 in early March. The S&P 500, by comparison trades at a ratio of 22.

Still, energy stocks could continue to faltering the short-term should concerns over the Delta variant push back return-to-office dates for big companies and reduce demand for business travel, said Burns McKinney, a senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. 
The sector also faces the prospect of tougher emission standards from the Biden administration and rising demand for electric vehicles, he added. Instead of making a broad bet on energy, McKinney is focusing on companies that have recently raised their dividends, a sign that the corporations believe their balance sheets may be strong enough to weather a potential slowdown in the economy, he said.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2021 08:50AM ET</span>",Scaramucci's SALT hedge fund confab returns in person in New York City,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A marquee Wall Street conference returns this week, but much like everyone's pandemic-era plans, the event hosted by hedge fund executive and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, will be a little different this year.
    The SALT event, one of the premier hedge fund industry conferences, kicks off Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York, rather than the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas where organizers hosted the event 10 times before.
The annual conference in Las Vegas was famous for pool parties, private rock concerts, and exclusive dinners as managers tried to get commitments for big checks from pension funds or other institutional investors.
The Delta variant — a more infectious version of the original coronavirus — will force changes at this year's event in New York where roughly 3,000 signed up after Scaramucci sent ""save the dates"" a few months ago. 
""Our goal has always been to empower big, important ideas and foster a community to address shared challenges,"" Scaramucci told Reuters. ""We're also bringing SALT to NYC for the first time to help spur revitalization efforts in the city, and want to demonstrate leadership by returning to some semblance of normalcy while maintaining a safe environment for our attendees.""
The founder of SkyBridge Capital became a celebrity beyond Wall Street circles a few years ago, when his 11-day stint as former President Donald Trump's communications director ended due to his heavily publicized criticism of other administration officials.
While the virus has tightened restrictions for travel and events, and many of SALT's international guests will be absent, 2,300 still plan to attend in person, the organizers said, noting all attendees must be vaccinated.
    ""There will be a mood of reserved optimism, but the conference won't have the same flash that it did in Vegas,"" said one person who plans to attend but asked not to be identified for fear of alienating organizers and business associates.
    Since its founding in 2009, the SALT conference has been a who's who of Wall Street fund managers, bankers, brokers, government officials and celebrities, including top athletes and former heads of state. Nearly every year they jetted to Vegas, often on private planes. 
After the pandemic scuttled in-person conferences in 2020, Scaramucci was determined to bring his event back in style.
Major speakers include Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, the leading candidate in New York’s mayoral race, as well as prominent investors like Steven A. Cohen, Daniel Loeb, Ray Dalio, Marc Lasry and Mike Novogratz.
The agenda is studded with panels on cryptocurrency trading, post pandemic best ideas and geopolitics. 
    There are some ironies.
    The Javits Center was a mass vaccination site for people in the New York City area from March until July, with medical staff administering more than 600,000 shots. It typically hosts mega-events like the New York International Auto Show.
In the past, SALT boasted performances by top-tier bands like Maroon 5 and Train. This year's musical act is The Chainsmokers, noted for performing at an event in the Hamptons where coronavirus spread. 
    One speaker will be Scaramucci's former White House boss, General John F. Kelly, who fired him. The two now have a close relationship.

    The backdrop has not dampened enthusiasm from some hedge fund managers who are eager to meet investors, talk to rivals and generally have what they expect will be a fun time.
    ""I'm glad they are doing it,"" said Jason Mudrick, founder of Mudrick Capital Management, adding ""It is a step in the right direction. We have to get back to things as normally as possible.""

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2021 08:41AM ET</span>","Toyota, Honda oppose U.S. House electric vehicle tax plan","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co on Saturday sharply criticized a proposal by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to give union-made electric vehicles in the United States an additional $4,500 tax incentive.
Toyota said in a statement that the plan unveiled late Friday discriminates ""against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize."" 
The bill, set to be voted on Tuesday by the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee as part of a proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers, which have union-represented auto plants. 
In a statement, Honda called the bill ""unfair"" and said it ""discriminates among EVs made by hard-working American auto workers based simply on whether they belong to a union. ... The Honda production associates in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio who will build our EVs deserve fair and equal treatment by Congress.""
The proposal, estimated to cost $33 billion to $34 billion over 10 years, would boost to up to $12,500 the maximum tax credit for electric vehicles, up from the current $7,500. The $12,500 figure includes a $500 credit for using U.S.-produced batteries.
The proposal is a key part of Democratic President Joe Biden's goal to ensure EVs comprise at least 50% of U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 and boost American union jobs.
The bill, however, does away with phasing out automakers' tax credits after they hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eligible again. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500.
GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV, the parent of Chrysler, assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in plants represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
In contrast, foreign automakers operating in the United States as well as Tesla do not have unions representing assembly workers and many of them have fought efforts by the UAW to organize U.S. plants.
Tesla would be eligible for up to $8,000 credits under the bill.
UAW President Ray Curry said the tax credit provision ""would go a long way in supporting-good paying union jobs in (the) EV auto sector that President Biden has championed.""

The bill limits the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000.
Toyota added it will ""fight to focus taxpayer dollars on making all electrified vehicles accessible for American consumers who can’t afford high-priced cars and trucks.""

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",Two leading Generali investors could seek new CEO -sources,"By Gianluca Semeraro and Claudia Cristoferi
MILAN (Reuters) -Two leading Generali (MI:GASI) investors are ready to push to replace current CEO Philippe Donnet if the top Italian insurer's board fails to reach an accord to keep him in the job, three sources close to the matter said.
The Trieste-based insurer is due to appoint a new board next spring and speculation over Donnet's future has mounted in recent months as tensions among shareholders simmer.
In a sign battle lines are being drawn, the two Generali investors, Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio, on Saturday disclosed a pact to consult over decisions concerning Generali..
Donnet's reappointment is in the hands of Generali's board which for the first time can submit its own slate of board candidates after the insurer changed its by-laws last year.
The sources said the two businessmen, who struck the pact over a combined 10.95% stake, are ready to file their own list of board nominees. The list would not include the current CEO though he is willing to run for another mandate, they said.
Donnet is already working on a new business plan for Generali due in December after steering the company through the COVID-19 crisis and keeping it on track to fully meet goals under the current plan through to end-2021.
Donnet currently enjoys the backing of Alberto Nagel, the CEO of Milanese bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), which is Generali's top investor with a 12.9% stake, as well as many board members at the insurer. 
Del Vecchio and Caltagirone are also, respectively, the first- and second-biggest investor in Mediobanca.
Over the past year, however, both Caltagirone, whose businesses span construction to publishing, and Del Vecchio, the founder of Ray-Ban owner Luxottica, have been critical of Donnet's strategy which they deem too cautious in seeking merger and acquisition opportunities.
According to one of the sources, the two businessmen could also propose a new chairman with a well-established international profile to oversee Generali's growth strategies. 
A compromise among shareholders is still possible, another of the sources said, and one solution could be the appointment of a managing director backed by both Del Vecchio and Caltagirone who would work alongside Donnet.

However, positions are still far apart, the sources said, ahead of a key meeting on Sept. 27 when Generali's board will kick off proceedings to submit its own list of nominees.
Before that, in an apparent attempt to find common ground, Generali non-executive board members will meet on Sept. 14, a fourth source said. Donnet will not attend the meeting as he is an executive member, the source added.

The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology proposed standards to companies on Friday for instant messaging services, telling them all platforms must be unblocked by a certain time.
The ministry said it may have to resort to other measures if the firms did not comply, the newspaper said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said on Friday it will release ""Eternals,"" ""West Side Story"" and the rest of its 2021 films exclusively in theaters before sending them to streaming, a show of confidence that moviegoing will rebound.
The company had experimented during the pandemic with debuting some movies on the Disney+ streaming service at the same time they ran in theaters. Cinema operators have been closely watching how Disney, which has dominated movie box offices in recent years, would handle its upcoming slate as the Delta variant slowed audiences' return to multiplexes.
Disney said in a statement that animated musical ""Encanto"" will play in theaters for 30 days starting Nov. 24 and head to Disney+ just before Christmas. The film tells the story of a family who live in a magical house in the mountains of Colombia. It includes music written by ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
All other Disney releases, including Marvel movie ""Eternals"" in November and Steven Spielberg's revival of ""West Side Story"" in December, will play exclusively in cinemas for at least 45 days, the company said.
Disney's most recent film, Marvel's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" just set a Labor Day weekend record with $94.7 million in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters. The film, featuring a predominantly Asian cast including Simu Liu and Awkwafina, played only at cinemas.
But moviegoing for the year remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Theater chains including AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cineworld Plc and Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) Inc are counting on big fall and winter titles to lure customers back.

Disney's other 2021 films are historical drama ""The Last Duel"" and animated comedy ""Ron's Gone Wrong"" in October, and action spy film ""The King's Man"" in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Friday proposed an expansion of tax credits for electric vehicles that includes significantly higher subsidies for union-made zero emission models assembled in the United States.
The proposal, a key part of President Joe Biden's goal to ensure EVs comprise at least 50% of U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 and boost U.S. union jobs, will give Detroit's Big Three automakers a big competitive edge and has drawn criticism from foreign automakers like Honda Motor Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
The tax credit for up to $12,500 per vehicle for U.S.-made union-made zero emission models compares with a $7,500 incentive for most other electric cars - an amount that has not changed.
The bill, however, does away with phasing out automakers' tax credits after they hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc eligible again. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500.
House Democrats had not previously disclosed how much they might boost EV credits. The dramatic hike and other revisions could cut the price of some EVs like GM's Chevrolet Bolt by as much as a third and make battery-powered vehicles more competitive with or in some cases cheaper than similar gasoline models.
""We want to incentivize this. It puts American manufacturers in the lead, which is where we want them, and it reduces emissions faster than any other policy that we could put in place,"" Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, told Reuters.
He said the new EV tax credit would cost an estimated $33 billion to $34 billion over a decade.
""In a decade, we want to see American workers making good wages building American electric vehicles,"" he added.
Kildee said Biden, who has made the proposal a cornerstone of his climate policy, ""was very insistent"" he wanted a hefty EV tax credit. ""He wants us to lean in. Let's go big and let's get this done,"" Kildee said, recounting a recent conversation with Biden.
BILL TO FACE OPPOSITION
GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV, the parent of Chrysler, assemble their U.S. made vehicles in plants represented by the United Auto Workers union.
In contrast, foreign automakers operating in the United States as well as Tesla do not have unions representing assembly workers and many of them have fought efforts by the UAW to organize U.S. plants.
As talk of the EV tax proposal gathered steam, Honda said in a statement last month that its workers ""deserve fair treatment from Congress and should not be penalized for their choice of a workplace.""
The House Ways and Means Committee will vote on Tuesday on the proposal which is a part of a broad tax measure in a planned $3.5 trillion spending bill.
The bill will face opposition in the Senate, which is evenly divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans have harshly criticized much of the spending bill and Democrats must hold onto all 50 Democratic Senate votes to win approval. 
But a Senate panel in May also approved legislation to boost EV credits to as much as $12,500 for U.S. vehicles made by union workers - despite all Republicans in opposition.
The proposed EV credits would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase.
In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs.
The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000.

But those limits may face pushback.
Last month, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favour of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Android app makers suing to stop Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from siphoning up to 30% of their sales received little reassurance about their chances on Friday as a judge allowed a comparable fee charged by Apple Inc to stand.
Developers including ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games in the last year took aim at the two biggest mobile app stores, run by Apple and Google. The critics view the fee as needlessly high, costing developers collectively billions of dollars a year, and a function of the two big tech companies having monopoly power.
Google's trial is at least a year away, time both sides could use to hone arguments based on the Apple decision, legal experts said.
In a ruling on Friday following a trial between Epic Games and Apple, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) required Apple to let developers tell customers about ways to pay outside of its App Store, leading Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) to fall 3.3%. Alphabet dropped 1.9%.
Google's Play store employs rules similar to the ones struck down in the Apple case, limiting developer communications with their customers, and Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Google could be at risk, too. He also noted the remaining risk of new regulatory action by lawmakers.
But Gonzalez Rogers allowed to stand requirements that developers bemoan even more. Those rules, including that in-app payments be made on Apple's own system, allow the company to collect its 15-30% fee. 
Apple General Counsel Katherine Adams told reporters that her company was ""extremely pleased."" Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that, ""Today's ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers.""
Vanderbilt Law School professor Rebecca Haw Allensworth said she agreed Gonzalez Rogers' findings were discouraging for the case against Google, while Valarie Williams, an antitrust partner at law firm Alston & Bird, said Google ""will likely be encouraged by the ruling.""  
The judge said the Apple restrictions allow users to rest assured that the apps they buy for the most part are free of viruses and pornography and that what they paid for will be delivered.
""App distribution restrictions increase security in the 'broad' sense by allowing Apple to filter fraud, objectionable content, and piracy during app review while imposing heightened requirements for privacy,"" Gonzalez Rogers wrote.
Apple's fee leads to ""extraordinary profits,"" according to her ruling. But if she forced Apple to ease restrictions, the company might struggle to gain any remuneration for providing a platform to developers, she said. Apple's selling point to consumers about having strong security and a centralized system also would be undermined, the judge added. 
Its 30% rate, she said, was set ""almost by accident when it first launched the App Store"" rather than as a result of market power.
Google has made similar arguments of privacy and security benefits as justification for its rules and fee, and it has long followed Apple's lead on commission levels, Google documents revealed in lawsuits show.
With Google's smaller share in the U.S. mobile app market, plaintiffs may have to reframe arguments to succeed against Google. Gonzalez Rogers said Epic's challenge of any commission at all was an unreasonable position versus Apple, and that Epic failed to offer clear evidence of the iPhone maker being a monopolist. 

Tweaked arguments may not be enough. The case against Google has been more difficult from the start. Google makes it possible to install apps from other sources, taking away from the monopoly argument. It also historically has been more lenient in enforcing some of its policies.
Google, Epic and attorneys for other developers suing the Play Store operator declined to comment. Utah's attorney general, which is helping lead a related lawsuit by U.S. states, said it is reviewing the judgment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge stopped short of labeling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) an ""illegal monopolist"" on Friday, but the closely-watched ruling provides a roadmap for similar claims against the iPhone maker in the future, legal experts said.
Ruling on an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, creator of the online game ""Fortnite,"" U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) said Epic did not present sufficient evidence of Apple having unlawful monopoly power in the relevant market, which she defined as ""digital mobile gaming transactions.""
But the California judge made clear that the decision was limited to the facts before her.
""While the Court finds that Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinarily high profit margins, these factors alone do not show antitrust conduct,"" Gonzalez Rogers said. ""The Court does not find that it is impossible; only that Epic Games failed in its burden to demonstrate Apple is an illegal monopolist.""
The judge did find that Apple's rules on its lucrative App Store business violated California state competition laws.
The question of whether Apple abused monopoly power ""remains very much unsettled,"" said Joshua Paul Davis, a professor of antitrust law at the University of San Francisco School of Law.
""Given how controversial these issues are right now, I would expect this not to be the final say,"" he said.
In her ruling, Gonzalez Rogers noted that Epic Games had ""overreached"" in a trial earlier this year by trying to define the relevant market as all app distribution and in-app payments on iPhones.
""As a consequence, the trial record was not as fulsome with respect to antitrust conduct in the relevant market as it could have been,"" Gonzalez Rogers said.
Apple's legal team said it was still reviewing whether to appeal the decision. 
""We're extremely pleased with this decision,"" Apple's General Counsel Katherine L. Adams told reporters. ""It underscores the merit of our business, both as an economic and competitive engine.""
Valarie Williams, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird, called Gonzalez Rogers' decision a ""road map"" to future plaintiffs pursuing monopoly claims against Apple.
Future plaintiffs could bring a case that adopts Gonzalez Rogers's market definition and introduces additional evidence, Williams said.
Sam Weinstein, a professor of antitrust law at Cardozo School of Law, agreed the judge's ruling could encourage other market participants to learn from Epic's case and try to launch a stronger blow against Apple.

Language in the ruling could even signal that the judge thinks ""it's only a matter of time"" before Apple becomes a monopoly, Weinstein said.
""This is only one particular piece of litigation framed in one particular way,"" said Davis. ""The court was pretty explicit that different litigants could come forward with different evidence...and that could potentially change the result.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Friday as investors weighed signs of higher inflation, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled following an unfavorable court ruling related to its app store.
U.S. producer prices rose solidly in August, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 11 years and indicating that high inflation was likely to persist as the pandemic pressures supply chains, data showed.
Sentiment also took a hit from Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester's comments that she would still like the central bank to begin tapering asset purchases this year despite the weak August jobs report.
The S&P 500 has risen about 19% in 2021, buoyed by support from dovish central bank policies and re-opening optimism. 
However, Wall Street has moved sideways in recent sessions as investor digest indications of increased inflation and concerns about the Delta variant's impact on the economic recovery. Investors are also uncertain about when the Federal Reserve may begin reducing massive measures enacted last year to shield the economy from the pandemic.
""The market is taking a breather,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ""Investors are looking for some outsized news or information that is beyond the band of expectations, something much more outsized, positively or negatively, that will give investors better visibility into how things are going to look for the balance of the year.""
Apple dropped 3.3% after a judge struck down a core part of its App Store rules, benefiting app makers. Its drop contributed more than any other stocks to the Nasdaq and S&P 500's declines.
Shares of app makers rallied, with Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology up 0.7%, and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) both gaining about 2%.
Losses in the three main indexes accelerated toward the end of the session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.78% to close at 34,607.72 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.77% to 4,458.58. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.87% to 15,115.49.
For the week, the S&P 500 lost 1.7%, the Dow declined 2.15% and the Nasdaq shed 1.61%.
Friday was the first time since February that the S&P 500 declined five days in a row.

All of the eleven S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with real estate and utilities each down more than 1% and leading the declines.
U.S.-listed Didi Global dropped 5% after Chinese government officials told leading delivery and ride-hailing companies to improve how they distributed incomes and ensure rest periods for workers.
Grocer Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co slumped nearly 8% after it said global supply chain disruptions, freight costs, discounts and wastage would hit its profit margins.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.0 billion shares, compared with the 9.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The company also attributed the delay in the mission, named ""Unity 23"", to the pending resolution of a probe by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Virgin Galactic said on Friday a third-party supplier warned of a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control system during test flight preparations. 
""At this point, it is not yet known whether the defect is present in the company's vehicles and what, if any, repair work may be needed,"" the company said, adding it was conducting inspections with the vendor.

The mission was initially set for late September or early October to carry three paying crew members from the Italian Air Force and the Rome-based government agency National Research Council.
The FAA is investigating the flight that took billionaire Richard Branson to space in July, and last week barred SpaceShipTwo flights until the agency approves the final mishap report or determines the issues do not affect public safety.

(Reuters) -Top U.S. health officials believe that  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine could be authorized for children aged 5-11 years old by the end of October, two sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.
    The timeline is based on the expectation that Pfizer, which developed the shot with Germany's BioNTech, will have enough data from clinical trials to seek emergency use authorization (EUA) for that age group from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) towards the end of this month, the sources said. 
They anticipate the FDA could make a decision on whether the shot is safe and effective in younger children within three weeks of the EUA submission.
The decision on whether to authorize a vaccine for younger children is eagerly anticipated by millions of Americans, particularly parents whose children started school in recent weeks amid a wave of infections driven by the Delta variant.
Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci outlined the timetable during an online town hall meeting attended by thousands of staff at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on Friday, according to one of the sources. A second source familiar with the situation said that the FDA anticipated a similar timeline for Pfizer.
If Pfizer submits its EUA by the end of September, and the data support its use, ""by the time we get to October, the first couple of weeks of October... the Pfizer product will likely be ready,"" Fauci said, according to the source.
Fauci said that  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc will likely take about three weeks longer than Pfizer to collect and analyze its data on children age 5-11, according to the source. He estimated that a decision on the Moderna shot could come around November, according to the source. The second source said Fauci's timeline for Moderna appeared ""optimistic.""
Officials at Pfizer, Moderna and NIH did not immediately comment.
Pfizer has previously said that it would have data on children age 5-11 ready in September and planned to submit for an EUA shortly after. Previously, federal health regulators, including Fauci, have suggested that an FDA decision might come in November or later. Moderna on Thursday told investors it expected data from its children's study by the end of the year.
Earlier on Friday, the FDA said it would work to approve the COVID-19 vaccines for children quickly https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-says-robust-safety-data-needed-before-covid-19-vaccine-approval-kids-2021-09-10 once the companies submitted their data. It said it would consider applications based on a faster path to authorize the shot for emergency use.

Such emergency authorization requires companies to submit two months of safety data on trial participants, versus six months required for full licensure.
Pfizer partner BioNTech told Der Spiegel that it also expects to request authorization globally for the COVID-19 vaccine in children as young as five over the next few weeks and that preparations for a launch were on track.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>","Apple must ease App Store rules, U.S. judge orders","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge struck down some of Apple Inc's App Store rules on Friday, forcing the company to allow developers to send their users to other payment systems in a partial win for ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games and other app makers.
But the judge did not require Apple to let app makers use their own in-app payment systems, one of Epic's top requests, and allowed Apple to continue to charge commissions of 15% to 30% for its own in-app payment system.
Epic said it would appeal the ruling, with CEO Tim Sweeney tweeting that the ruling ""isn't a win for developers or for consumers."" 
The outcome left Apple's critics and rivals saying they are more likely to turn to legislators, rather than courts, to pursue the changes they seek. 
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) described her ruling as requiring a ""measured"" change to Apple's rules. Analysts said the impact may depend heavily on how the iPhone maker chooses to implement the decision.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were down 3.2% late on Friday afternoon, but many Wall Street analysts maintained their long-term favorable outlooks on the iPhone maker.
""We suspect the eventual impact from this will be manageable,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to investors.
The ruling vastly expands a concession made to streaming video companies last week https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-gives-reader-apps-way-around-commissions-who-wins-2021-09-02 allowing them to direct users to outside payment methods. The decision expands that exemption to all developers, including the game developers who are the biggest cash generators for Apple's App Store, which itself is the foundation of its $53.8 billion services segment.
The judge ruled that Apple can no longer bar developers from providing buttons or links in their apps that direct customers to other ways to pay outside of Apple's own in-app purchase system. The ruling also said Apple cannot ban developers from communicating with customers via contact information obtained by the developers when customers signed up within the app.
The ruling comes after a three-week trial in May before Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. 
Gonzalez Rogers stopped short of granting Epic some of its other wishes, such as forcing Apple to open the iPhone up to third-party app stores.
Apple said in a statement: ""As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal. Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world.""
In a media briefing, Apple's legal team said it does not believe the ruling forces it to allow developers to implement their own in-app purchase systems. Apple officials said the company is still debating how it will implement the requirements of the ruling and whether it will appeal.
The judge sided with Apple on key questions such as defining the relevant antitrust market as gaming transactions, rejecting Epic's argument that the iPhone is its own app market over which Apple is a monopolist. 
""Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers,"" Epic's CEO, Sweeney, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We will fight on."" 
The Epic lawsuit began after the game maker inserted its own in-app payments system in ""Fortnite.""
MORE CHALLENGES LIKELY 
Challenges to Apple's App Store rules are far from over. The ruling on Friday suggests they are more likely to play out in statehouses and capitals than in courtrooms.
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are considering bills that would force Apple to allow third-party in-app payment systems, and South Korea's parliament has already passed such a law.
""What today’s ruling also makes clear is that antiquated antitrust laws cannot solely be fixed by the courts,"" Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), which has challenged Apple's practices in Europe and owns the popular dating app Tinder, said in a statement. ""Apple and Google's monopolistic practices will only end when we bring our laws into the digital age, as South Korea did last week."" 
Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress said the ruling showed that courts alone will not address their concerns. 
While Gonzalez Rogers did not find that Apple is a monopolist, she found that the trial showed Apple was violating California state competition and showed some ""incipient antitrust violations"" that required a nationwide remedy.
John Newman, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the ruling leaves open avenues for U.S. regulators to challenge Apple in court. Reuters has previously reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is probing the iPhone maker.
The orders follow Apple's agreement last week https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation-2021-09-02 with the Japan Fair Trade Commission, under which it eases rules for ""reader"" apps like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) to provide a link to customers to sign up for a paid account outside of the app. Games are a larger portion of Apple's sales.
But whether the ruling eats in to that revenue depends on how Apple implements the changes.

""To some degree, Apple could make it so that its in-app payments are still the easiest to use,"" said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies.
Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, whose Google unit operates an app store for Android smartphones and which Epic is also suing on antitrust charges, were down 1.7% late on Friday.

(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee has voted to include language in a wider budget reconciliation package that would block Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd from building its Resolution copper mine in Arizona.
The San Carlos Apache (NASDAQ:APA) tribe and other Native Americans say the mine would destroy sacred land (https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-mining-resolution-idCNL1N2LO28S) where they hold religious ceremonies. Elected officials in nearby Superior, Arizona, say the mine is crucial for the region's economy. 
The House Natural Resources Committee late on Thursday folded the Save Oak Flat Act into the $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending measure. The full House could reverse the move and the legislation (https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senates-reconciliation-process-its-not-way-it-sounds-2021-08-10) faces an uncertain fate in the U.S. Senate, 
If approved, the bill would reverse a 2014 decision by former President Barack Obama and Congress that set in motion a complex process (https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-mining-resolution-idCNL1N2LO28S) to give Rio federally-owned Arizona land that contains more than 40 billion pounds of copper in exchange for acreage that Rio owns nearby.
Former President Donald Trump gave the land swap final approval (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-resolution/outgoing-trump-admin-oks-land-swap-for-rio-tintos-arizona-copper-mine-idUSKBN29K22P) before leaving office in January, but successor Joe Biden reversed that decision (https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-forest-service-blocks-land-swap-rio-tintos-arizona-copper-mine-2021-03-01/), leaving the project in limbo.
The final reconciliation budget is expected to include funding for solar, wind and other renewable energy projects that require immense volumes of copper. Electric vehicles use twice as much copper as those with internal combustion engines. The Resolution mine could fill about 25% of the demand for U.S. copper.
Superior Mayor Mila Besich, a Democrat, said the project seems increasingly stuck in ""bureaucratic purgatory.""
""This move seems contradictory to what the Biden administration is trying to do to address climate change,"" said Besich. ""I hope the full House does not allow that language to stay in the final bill.""

Rio said it would continue consultation with local communities and tribes. Rio Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm plans to visit Arizona later this year.
Representatives for the San Carlos Apache and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Ltd, which is a minority investor in the project, could not immediately be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street main indexes finished lower on Friday after data showing persistent U.S. inflation offset expectations of an easing in U.S.-China tensions after a call between President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping.
U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, indicating that high inflation is likely to persist for a while, with supply chains remaining tight as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
""Headlines reflecting the highest annual producer price increases in decades won’t give those worried about inflation much comfort, but the smaller month-over-month increase and recent evidence indicating supply chain bottlenecks are no longer intensifying suggest a peak in producer inflation may be near,"" said Marc Zabicki, director of research for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.65 points, or 0.19 percent, to 34,814.73; the S&P 500 lost 4.21 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,489.07 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.20 points, or 0.02 percent, to 15,245.06.
Earlier, global equities markets gained after news that the U.S. president and his Chinese counterpart spoke for 90 minutes on Thursday, their first talk in seven months, discussing the need to avoid conflict between the world's two largest economies. 
China shares rose 0.08%, giving a fillip to the region and lifting MSCI's World index, its broadest gauge of global stock markets 0.07%, on course to end a three-day losing streak.
Despite the gains, helped by a similar performance across Europe's top markets, the index remains down 0.6% on the week and on course for its first drop in three, albeit hovering near a record high.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 3% following a U.S. court ruling in ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit that struck down some of the iPhone maker's restrictions on how developers can collect payments in apps.
The pace at which central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, choose to trim their economic support remains the driving force of market sentiment amid rising inflation concerns.
Thursday's move by the ECB to trim bond purchases slightly is expected to be followed by the Fed later this year, according to some officials, despite a weak August U.S. jobs report.
""With the ECB raising its economic projections for 2022 and beyond, it appears that the high-water mark in policy accommodation has been passed,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management.
Looking ahead, Dowding said next week's U.S. inflation print could help dictate near-term market direction.
Despite the prospect of reduced stimulus packages, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said he expected central banks to keep interest rates low.
""This is positive for equity markets, particularly cyclical and value areas of the market. And while this complicates the search for yield, we continue to see opportunities,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
""In currencies, we think going long GBP and NOK and short EUR and CHF should provide a mid- to high-single-digit percentage upside on a total return basis over the next six to 12 months.""
Against the broader risk-on backdrop, and despite persistent concerns around COVID infection rates, the greenback was up 0.1% against a basket of major peers.
The euro was last down 0.12 percent, at $1.1811, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.23 percent at 1,796.26.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose after the U.S. inflation data.
Elsewhere in currencies, the pound fell 0.01% despite data showing the British economic recovery slowed in July.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 04:07PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate Democrats float stock buyback tax as part of $3.5 trillion bill,"By David Lawder and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two senior U.S. Senate Democrats on Friday unveiled a proposal to impose a 2% excise tax on corporate stock buybacks as lawmakers scrambled to find ways to finance President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion domestic investment plan.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden and Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown said the ""Stock Buyback Accountability Act"" would encourage large corporations to invest in their workers rather than enriching investors executives by boosting stock prices. 
The proposal is among several floated by Wyden to boost government revenues, including imposing additional taxes on corporations that give out CEO pay that exceeds a certain multiple of the company's average worker wages.
Biden and congressional Democrats have already been pushing to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations to help pay the $3.5 trillion bill.
But resistance from moderate members of the party, including some who represent states or districts that supported former Republican President Donald Trump, have prompted Democrats to search for a new mix of revenue-raisers. 
Republicans are attacking Democrats over the bill as both parties position themselves for the 2022 mid-term elections which will determine control of Congress.
Representative Kevin Brady, the senior Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said Democratic tax hikes ""could kill a million U.S. jobs, raise fuel prices and leave America more dependent on foreign oil.""
Democrats portray their effort as a ""once-in-a-generation"" chance to improve the lives of the elderly and disadvantaged children, address climate change and reform immigration.
Multiple House committees this week began considering amendments to the $3.5 trillion bill. Ways and Means has defeated several Republican amendments aimed at limiting its scope.
Next week, that panel is expected to debate the politically-charged issue of tax increases in the bill, which also contains some tax breaks for those earning less than $400,000.
WORKERS
The 2% stock buyback tax seeks to address Democrats' frustrations with an increase in stock buybacks by publicly traded companies in 2018 after a massive corporate tax cut passed by Republicans at the end of 2017 that allowed firms to repatriate profits held overseas at low rates. 
""Instead of spending billions buying back stocks and handing out CEO bonuses, it’s past time Wall Street paid its fair share and reinvested more of that capital into the workers and communities who make those profits possible,” said Brown, who is also a Senate Finance Committee member.
The Brown-Wyden legislation would prohibit companies from deducting the cost of the excise tax from their income but would exclude stock repurchases to fund an employee pension plan or employee stock plans.
In the face of strong Republican opposition to the legislation, Democrats in both houses of Congress aim to craft a bill that they can pass on their own.
That is particularly important in the Senate because under special budget ""reconciliation"" rules Democrats would not need the 60 votes in the 100-member chamber normally required to advance legislation.

The Senate currently is split 50-50 between the two parties.
House committees are expected to complete their work next week, which would leave leading Democrats in the House and Senate working on revisions to bring down the $3.5 trillion price to give it a better chance of passing.

By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Nielsen's chief executive defended the company Thursday, as the ratings behemoth comes under renewed fire from the TV industry and faces questions about the accuracy of a system through which at least $60 billion of advertising is bought and sold a year.
“We haven’t been perfect,” CEO David Kenny wrote in a letter to the industry. “We also understand that we need to move faster in advancing our measurement because the audience itself is moving faster.” 
Nielsen is facing escalating criticism from its TV industry clients, many of which say it has insufficiently captured consumers’ shift from traditional TV to streaming. Nielsen measures TV audiences through a sample set of panelists who use special devices in their homes.
TV ratings are the backbone of the industry’s business model - enabling advertisers to learn how many people are watching their ads and helping networks set the price for those slots. This year advertisers are expected to spend almost $60 billion on TV ads, according to forecaster Zenith, increasing to $63 million next year.
In April the trade group representing the major television networks said Nielsen undercounted TV viewers during the pandemic when the company’s technicians were not able to get into panelists’ homes to fix devices. That charge was later confirmed by the Media Ratings Council, which enforces measurement standards in media. 

On Sept. 1, the council announced it was suspending Nielsen’s accreditation, a move that does not immediately affect Nielsen’s business, but hurts its credibility.
At least one media company is publicly seeking an alternative to relying solely on Nielsen. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp-owned NBCUniversal recently announced it is developing its own audience measurement system and is evaluating proposals from more than 80 companies, including Nielsen, to help “modernize the industry’s approach.”

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>","Factbox-Apple vs Epic case: heated arguments, dramatic calls","(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday issued a ruling in ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store, striking down some of Apple's restrictions on how developers can collect payments in apps.
The ruling comes after a three-week trial in May before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Here are some highlights from the case: 
EPIC CEO SWEENEY SAYS APPLE HAS ""TOTAL CONTROL""
Tim Sweeney said Apple exercised ""total control over"" all software on iOS when he testified in May, and that he knew he was breaking Apple's App Store rules by putting Epic's own in-app payment system into the game. Apple countered it was simply trying to protect the security and privacy of its 1 billion iPhone users. 
EXPERTS BATTLE 
Experts make the case that Apple's iPhone users are so loyal that the device constitutes a single-brand market. Apple has long argued that it is a minority player in thriving markets, but a decision otherwise could have far reaching implications for its business. 
DISPROPORTIONATE PROFITS 
Apple made at least $100 million - and likely more - from ""Fortnite"" in just two years, showing how lucrative the App Store model can be for the iPhone maker.
Gonzalez Rogers questioned Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, pressing him to concede that game developers generate most App Store revenue and help subsidize other apps on the store that pay no commission. 
Epic has asked the judge to order Apple to allow users to put third-party software onto their iPhones and ease its in-app payment rules.
FRAZZLED COOK 
Apple saved Cook to be its star closing witness, but then Judge Gonzalez Rogers grilled him hard enough to throw the normally unflappable Cook off balance. 
When Gonzalez Rogers cited a survey that found 39% of software developers were unhappy with Apple's app distribution services, Cook replied that ""we turn the place upside down"" to respond to developer complaints. He later conceded that he does not receive regular reports on how developers feel about working with Apple. 
GAMERS VOICE OUT 
In an effort to make the trial accessible to the media and the public, Gonzalez Rogers set up audio-only phone lines that both groups could dial into, but the effort was hamstrung by the aging technology available to underfunded federal courts. 

Through the trial, the masking and plexiglass required by COVID-19 precautions made some witnesses - including Sweeney - almost unintelligible on the phone lines. 
During the first day of trial, when the court's staff, struggling to get the lines working, inadvertently left the public lines unmuted, it revealed a cacophony of chatter from ""Fortnite"" fans who had dialed in, including some foul language and commentary such as, ""if Apple wins, destroy all your Apple devices!""

(Reuters) -U.S. supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co reported a fall in a main measure of profitability on Friday, blaming wastage, discounts and this year's squeeze on global supply chains.
The company's shares tumbled as much as 9.1%.
U.S. retailers have been spending more on shipping and labor this year, as pandemic-driven port congestion and a shortage of drivers increase the cost of stocking up their shelves. 
""Consistent with many retailers, we experienced supply chain constraints and increased warehouse and transportation costs during the quarter,"" Kroger Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call. 
""We expect supply chain costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year.""
Kroger's gross margin - the revenue left after deducting the costs of goods sold - was 21.4% in the second quarter, compared with 22.6% in the first.
Packaged food makers and grocers that sell their own private-label products have also reeled under higher costs of ingredients, such as wheat, meat and edible oils, forcing them to raise prices and warn of future increases as well.
""The messaging (from Kroger) was that... some inflation – notably on meat – was not fully passed on to consumers,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
However, a boom in at-home cooking during the pandemic helped the operator of Ralphs, Dillons and Fred Meyer stores raise its annual adjusted profit forecast to between $3.25 and $3.35 per share, ahead of analysts' expectations, after topping second-quarter sales and earnings estimates.

""As food-at-home demand moderates, these (margin) headwinds could be more pronounced,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.
To attract new customers and turn existing ones into more loyal shoppers, the chain has launched in Florida ""Kroger Delivery Savings Pass,"" a service that offers unlimited delivery for $79 annually.

(Reuters) - Food-delivery companies DoorDash Inc, Grubhub Inc and Uber Eats (N:UBER) have sued New York City over a legislation to license food-delivery apps and to permanently cap commissions they can charge restaurants.
The three food-delivery companies filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York late on Thursday. The companies are seeking an injunction that would prevent New York from enforcing the fee-cap ordinance adopted last month, as well as unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.
The New York City Council approved in August a legislation which limits the amount that food-delivery companies can charge restaurants to use their platforms and requires them to obtain operating licenses that are valid for two years.
""Those permanent price controls will harm not only Plaintiffs, but also the revitalization of the very local restaurants that the City claims to serve,"" the companies said in the lawsuit filed on Thursday.
The suit argues that the legislation is unconstitutional because ""it interferes with freely negotiated contracts between platforms and restaurants by changing and dictating the economic terms on which a dynamic industry operates"".
The legislation comes after the city enacted temporary caps on the commissions food delivery companies charged restaurants during the pandemic, when so many of them were forced to close or rely on delivery and carry-out alone.
It seeks to limit the amount those companies can charge restaurants to 15% of food orders for delivery services and 5% for advertising and other non-delivery services.
The New York City restaurant delivery market is split almost evenly among the major platforms, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which collects payment data from customers.

DoorDash commanded 36% of July sales in the city, Grubhub 34% and Uber Eats and Postmates a joint 30%.

Investing.com – Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) rose 4% Friday as Needham initiated coverage of the stock with a buy, citing the company’s leadership in the crowded U.S. residential solar industry and cheap valuations.
The stock has more than halved from its high of $100.93. Analyst Vikram Bagri sees the shares at $75, an upside of around 61% from the stock’s current level.
Bagri pointed that the company has around 15% share of the market which is almost twice that of its nearest rival.
According to him, the industry can keep growing at a fast pace due to adoption of electric vehicles, a focus on energy resilience, rising utility rates, and heightened environmental awareness.
The analyst believes Sunrun's management team, customer relationships, established channel partners, and quality of service will help it reap the benefit of opportunities."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it was looking to complete the data review as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months. 
The FDA granted full approval last month for the use of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine in people over the age of 16 based on a six-month follow-up from the trial. The shot was authorized in December for emergency use based on a shorter, two-month follow up.
The agency is under pressure to approve a vaccine for children below 12 years of age amid a surge in infections fueled by the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant, which has disrupted the reopening of schools. 
Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc are racing to submit clinical data seeking regulatory approval for their vaccines in children below 12 years of age. 
Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine has been currently authorized for children aged 12 to 15 in the United States. 
Pfizer said it expects to report data needed for approval in five and 11 year olds sometime this month and could potentially submit an application for emergency use shortly after. The drugmaker said data for kids aged two and under five could arrive soon after.

For children between six months and two years, Pfizer has said it could have a safety and immunogenicity data as early as October or November.
Moderna on Thursday said it has fully enrolled participants in a trial testing its shot in children between six and 11 years and that it was still conducting dose selection studies for younger age groups.

This shift in fashion preference should bolster the growth of leading players in this space—Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), The Gap (GPS), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), and Guess? (GES). So read on for a closer examination of these stocks’ prospects.Although the denim industry suffered a decline in sales amid the pandemic as consumers limited their discretionary spending, shifting fashion preferences to more relaxed styles and increasing spending on apparel as people update their wardrobes to resume day-to-day outdoor activities have fueled the industry’s recovery. Jeans lovers are shifting their preference to wide-legged jeans due to their versatility and all-purpose comfort features. According to retail specialist Stephanie Wissink’s analysis, google searches for low-rise jeans with wide-legged and flare jeans have surged 91% over the past six months.
With consumers returning to looser and more comfortable styles and denim brands, the demand for wide-legged jeans should increase. The global market for denim jeans is expected to reach $83.2 billion by 2026, registering a 4.7% CAGR. This trend should give the jeans industry a much-needed boost.
Hence, we think it could be wise to bet on popular denim stocks Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI), The Gap, Inc. (GPS), Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF), and Guess?, Inc. (GES). We expect these companies to generate substantial sales growth in the coming months.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.4% Friday as a judge ruled that the iPhone-maker could no longer prohibit developers from providing links or other communication that direct users away from its in-app purchasing service.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ injunction came in the much-publicized dispute between the world’s largest company and Epic Games, the firm behind the popular online video game Fortnite. The ruling will take 90 days to come into effect.
Apple charges apps 15% to 30% per transaction on its platform, a policy software developers find prohibitive but still comply with to be present on the devices of the world’s third largest smartphone maker. There was some relief for Apple in the ruling, though.  
Rogers (NYSE:ROG) said that Apple was not a monopolist and “success is not illegal.”
Epic wanted to install its own app store on iPhones, which would allow it to duck paying a fee to Apple. The game publisher gave consumers the option to buy Fortnite cheaper directly from its website. Apple removed the game from its store, which eventually led to Epic filing the lawsuit.
As per the order, Epic will pay Apple damages because it breached its contract, amounting to 30% of all revenue it collected from iOS Fortnite through direct payments.
Apple has recently taken steps to address concerns over its in-app purchase policy. This includes allowing developers to email customers about alternatives to app store billing to pay them directly, instead of going through Apple.

It would add new UPS services just in time for the peak holiday shipping season when demand for local home delivery will surge. 
""Roadie often provides service for shipments not compatible with the UPS network because of their size and perishable nature, and often because they are in shopping bags without the packaging required to move through the UPS system,"" UPS said in a statement.

MUNICH (Reuters) - As carmakers gathered in Munich on Monday to launch almost exclusively zero- or low-emission vehicles, an ongoing semiconductor shortage cast a long shadow over the first major car show since before the pandemic began.
Forced to shut down plants last year, carmakers now face increasing competition from the consumer electronics industry for chip deliveries. That problem has been compounded by a series of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic.
Cars have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.
Speaking during the launch of a couple of electric vehicles (EVs) on Sunday evening, Ola Källenius, CEO at premium German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), said that while the company is hopeful its own supply will improve in the fourth quarter, soaring demand for chips means the industry could struggle to source enough of them into 2023 - though the shortage should be less severe by then.
""Several chip suppliers have been referring to structural problems with demand,"" Källenius said. ""This could influence 2022 and (the situation) may be more relaxed in 2023.""
Joerg Burzer, head of supply chain at Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s carmaking unit Mercedes-Benz, said he was hoping the situation would stabilise in the fourth quarter. ""Relaxation will come later.""
The IAA (NYSE:IAA) Mobility show in Munich is the first major motor industry event worldwide since the global coronavirus pandemic.
Despite the ongoing shortage, Daimler board member Britta Seeger said the carmaker does not believe its long-term electric vehicle goals will be affected.
Automakers from U.S. group General Motors (NYSE:GM) to India's Mahindra and Japan's Toyota have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.
Just last week, Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc cut its delivery forecast for the third quarter due to uncertain and volatile semiconductor supplies.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) CEO Luca De Meo said on Monday the chip shortage had been tougher than expected during the current third quarter, but said the situation should improve in the fourth quarter.
Major auto supplier Bosch said it expects the shortage will ease somewhat in the coming months, but supplies will remain constrained into next year.

BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said the premium carmaker expects supply chains to remain tight well into 2022.
""I expect that the general tightness of the supply chains will continue in the next 6 to 12 months,"" he said.

The management shuffle comes as major Wall Street banks are forced to bring about change in an industry that has few women or people of color in its top ranks.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) last year named Jane Fraser as its new chief executive, making her the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank.

BofA appointed Holly O'Neill as president of retail banking. O'Neill, who joined BofA in 1996, most recently ran consumer client services at the bank.
Wendy Stewart, who joined the bank's consumer and commercial businesses in 1996, has been appointed to the role of president of global consumer banking at BofA. BofA also appointed Cathy Bessant as vice chair, global strategy.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 10:00AM ET</span>",Analysis-EasyJet bid kicks off scramble for budget airline supremacy,"By Sarah Young and Conor Humphries
LONDON/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Europe's no-frills airlines are heralding a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grab market share from traditional carriers struggling to emerge from the pandemic, but each will have to overcome significant challenges to come out on top.
Market leader Ryanair this week saw talks over a mega-plane deal fall apart, while No.2 easyJet (LON:EZJ) is lagging the recovery of its rivals so far. 
Smaller Wizz Air has had an audacious bid for easyJet rejected, sources say, a move that would create a much stronger challenger to Ryanair if a deal could be done, but which some analysts think could be a distraction at a time of rapid change. 
At stake is potentially the biggest reshaping of Europe's aviation industry for a generation, with low-cost airlines looking to outmanoeuvre heavily indebted traditional carriers as COVID-19 travel restrictions are wound down. 
Ireland's Ryanair, with 150 million passengers in the year before the pandemic and 200 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets on order, had until this week looked set to extend its lead to the end of the decade with a deal for up to 250 more. 
But talks collapsed spectacularly on Monday, leaving boss Michael O'Leary - long wedded to both Boeing and a strategy of expanding organically - with few quick options to accelerate growth.
That put the spotlight on Jozsef Varadi, CEO of Hungarian upstart Wizz Air, who sources say has made two bold moves to seize the initiative.
Wizz, which flew just 40 million passengers at its pre-pandemic peak, is in talks to order at least 100 new Airbus jets in addition to the 268 strong fleet it is due to have by 2027, sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Sources also named Wizz as the mystery bidder behind a spurned approach to easyJet, which flew around 100 million passengers a year before the pandemic. 
That would tear up Wizz's ultra-low cost gospel of internal expansion at all costs for the sake of a major, instant step-up in scale. 
While easyJet said its suitor - which it did not name - was no longer interested, and Wizz declined to comment, the move highlighted the risks of easyJet's very different management approach. 
EASYJET CONTRACTION
EasyJet has long been a hybrid player, focused on undercutting legacy airlines at established airports, while Wizz and Ryanair shun most hubs and focus on pared back fares that exclude other costs like baggage - the ""ultra-low-cost"" model. But some feel easyJet's decision to shrink - it has reduced its fleet by 10% in response to the pandemic - may have left it exposed, making its strategy a tougher sell to investors than the growth stories of its rivals. 
More reliant on Britain's slower travel recovery than most of the rest of Europe, easyJet is now also lagging the pick up in business at its main competitors. 
EasyJet ""are very different from what Wizz Air or Ryanair are offering the market at present. So in that sense they are kind of vulnerable as consolidation efforts occur post-COVID,"" said Joe Gill, head of origination at brokers Goodbody.
After rejecting the bid, easyJet plans to raise 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) to stay in the race by funding growth at airports. It now has to convince investors to double down on its more cautious strategy just as a bid raises the prospect of a bolder alternative.
Investor meetings this week are trying to win shareholders over to a dilutive rights issue, the second time easyJet has asked for cash during the crisis. The first time, its top shareholder and founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou did not take part.
EasyJet says the funds will give it the firepower to grab slots at premium airports like Paris Orly, Lisbon, Milan Linate and London's Gatwick.
But investors will be aware that any further COVID-19 restrictions could lead to another wash-out winter, swiftly burning through the new money.
Industry sources say Varadi has long had easyJet in his sights. As well as creating a low-cost giant focused on Airbus planes, a combined Wizz-easyJet would add Wizz's low-cost bases in eastern Europe to prime easyJet hubs at Gatwick, as well as across France, Switzerland and elsewhere in western Europe.
""I think there is room for all three, but the question is, over time ... will Wizz come back again with another effort to deliver the consolidation which I think is practically inevitable,"" said aviation consultant John Strickland.
RYANAIR'S NEXT MOVE
With few cards to play, O'Leary on Wednesday started a game of chicken with Boeing by threatening to forgo any new order from the U.S. planemaker for up to a decade – implying he could happily survive with the 650 or so jets he will have when current deliveries complete in 2025.
Observers see few alternatives to returning to the table with Boeing as relations with Airbus are strained and antitrust issues would likely preclude a bid for easyJet. In fact, O'Leary may welcome an easyJet tie-up as a distraction to Wizz.
""It would be good for Ryanair because it would put up Wizz’s costs,"" said a senior industry source.
COVID CRISIS
Fuelling the low-cost jostling is the fact the pandemic has tipped the industry balance in their favour and away from network carriers like Air France-KLM, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Lufthansa.
During the pandemic, a lower cost base and more flexible business model has better protected no-frills players, while difficulties restarting long-haul travel have deepened this advantage.
But the challenge for the budget brigade is to achieve growth in a way that does not dilute their cost advantage - either by overpaying for jets or acquiring a higher cost rival - a point made starkly by Wizz chairman and no-frills airline tycoon Bill Franke before the pandemic.

""Not staying disciplined about the business model and allowing other costs to leak in is the 'path to hell',"" Franke told Reuters.

Investing.com – Traeger (NYSE:COOK) stock fell 9% Friday as the company reported a net loss in the second quarter after expenses more than doubled.
This was the company’s first earnings announcement after it went public in July.
Sales and marketing expenses soared to $47.3 million compared to $21 million in the second quarter last year. The company attributed this to increase in advertising spend for greater customer awareness and driving demand. It also spent more on acquiring and improving the customer experience.
General and administrative expenses were $24.8 million, compared to $9.3 million last time. This was largely due to an increase of $10.3 million in professional services in connection with the refinancing of the company's long-term debt, consulting services, and legal expenses, it said.
The jump in expenses overtook the 39% increase in revenue to $213 million.
As a result, the company reported a net loss of $4.9 million compared to a profit of $18.85 million in the second quarter of last year.
Inventory rose as the company targeted higher levels of safety stock to meet expected demand.
The maker of wood pellet grill, an outdoor cooking system, expects yearly revenue to come in at $765 million at midpoint of the range.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, sentiment boosted by the first call between the U.S. and Chinese presidents in seven months - even if no obvious progress was made in reducing tension between the world's two biggest economies.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 116 points, or 0.3%, at 34,995 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
The market shrugged off potentially negative news such as another multiyear high for producer price inflation, which accelerated to 8.3% in August from 7.8% in July, driven by a broad range of products rather than just meat and poultry, as one White House briefing this week had tried to depict. The market also shrugged off reports of Democratic senators presenting their plans to tax stock buybacks and close tax loopholes regarding remuneration of partnerships.
""The economic data continue to show sharply rising prices, which put pressure on fiscal and monetary authorities to adjust policy to prevent economic overheating,"" said Stephen Dover (NYSE:DOV), chief market strategist with Franklin Templeton, in a blog post before the publication of the PPI data. Comments out of the Federal Reserve this week have tended on balance to indicate that the Fed will likely signal a gradual tapering of its $120 billion monthly bond purchases from November onward.
On the upside, some market participants have been encouraged by signs that the U.S. Covid-19 infection curve is starting to dip, although that has come too late to stop three of the country's biggest airlines posting profit warnings on Thursday. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Thursday became the latest large-scale employer to scrap its plans to return the workforce to the office, following similar actions by a number of Big Tech and Wall Street names. 
Among the standout movers in early trading were Traeger (NYSE:COOK) stock, which gapped down 6.9% after the maker of smart grills disappointed with its first results since listing as a public company. Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock fell 7.1% after the grocery store chain also reported weak quarterly numbers. 
To the upside, Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) stock rose 22% after its quarterly report underlined how the buy-now-pay-later fintech is rapidly scaling up. That process is set to be accelerated even further when its intended partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) goes live. 
Chipmaking stocks were also in the ascendant, again, amid the ongoing shortage of their products which appears set to last well into next year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was up 2.5% while Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was up 2.9%. Both stand to gain from a relaxation of the rules in supplying high-tech components to China, a hope encouraged by the call between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. 
Elsewhere, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock extended gains after rising 10% on Thursday in response to the company's announcement of plans for an own-apparel brand. The stock was up 5.1%. By contrast, Take Two Interactive Software stock fell 2.5% after pushing back the launch of its new iterations of Grand Theft Auto until well into next year."

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 09:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Aerospace firms warn of snags over U.S. engine rule delays,"By Allison Lampert and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Aerospace companies are urging the United States to speed up a review of rule changes for airplane engines, warning delays in implementing planned global emissions standards could trigger industrial delays.
The warning from the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) comes as aerospace firms are more exposed to unexpected regulatory or economic hiccups following the COVID-19 crisis.
The standards would curb the flow of potentially damaging soot particles and do not take effect until the start of 2023. 
But executives warn an already overstretched supply chain needs clarity long before then to avoid disruption. And they complain that a process involving two Washington agencies is moving too slowly, while Europe has already taken action.
""Any delay to regulatory implementation would create uncertainty, potentially significantly impacting our supply chain, airline deliveries, and damage U.S. industry’s overall global competitiveness,"" said Leslie Riegle, AIA assistant vice-president of civil aviation in response to a Reuters query.
The rules must be vetted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which expects to produce a final rule by September 2022.
But industry officials say the EPA's timetable means the deadline could be placed at risk because the changes must also be signed off by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
It is not clear when the FAA would complete its work, but industry sources say it is likely to take several months. After that, they say, companies would need further time to adapt.
The United States is home to two of the world’s three biggest engine makers,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Pratt & Whitney. 
GE said it encourages the administration ""to accelerate its rule making"" so that manufacturers have ""clear standards for demonstrating compliance prior to the 2023 deadline.""
Pratt & Whitney declined to comment.
UNUSUAL WORKAROUND
Both agencies, EPA and FAA, said they are working towards completing the process by the time the global standard becomes effective at the beginning of 2023.
Still, questions over whether the deadline will be met have prompted some executives to contemplate an unusual workaround by seeking approvals indirectly from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the FAA's counterpart in Europe.
Such a step is possible because of the interconnected nature of the aerospace industry. But it would need the involvement of the FAA and could create extra work and costs for U.S. manufacturers, a senior industry source said.
The proposal comes at a time when U.S. regulators are seeing their traditional aviation leadership increasingly diluted after a crisis over the design and approval of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX.
""Any actions EASA may take on this matter will be coordinated closely with the FAA,"" an EASA spokesperson said. The FAA did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the potential workaround.
The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), whose governing council adopted the new global standards in 2020, has said they will reduce the environmental and health impact of sooty emissions known as non-volatile particulate matter.

ICAO cannot impose its will on governments, so the United States, Europe and other countries that produce planes must translate the global engine standards into national rules. 
EASA said European companies had already begun submitting applications aimed at complying with the rules, which apply to engines supplying at least 6,000 pounds of thrust that are in production starting from 2023 and new designs after that.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The United States on Friday allowed imports from Malaysia's Top Glove Corp, after customs authorities lifted a year-long ban imposed for alleged forced labour https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-seizes-shipment-malaysias-top-glove-over-forced-labour-concerns-2021-05-13 found at the world's largest medical glove maker. 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had banned gloves made by Top Glove in July 2020, saying it had found abuses of migrant workers.
In a statement, the CBP said it will now allow imports after a thorough review of evidence that showed Top Glove has addressed all indicators of forced labour. 
Top Glove had said earlier its disposable gloves would be admissible at all U.S. ports as of Sept. 10. 
Its shares, which have plunged about 40% since the ban, jumped as much as 10% on Friday.
Top Glove has taken a hit to reputation and business from the ban, which came at a time when it was making record profits as the COVID-19 pandemic boosted demand for its gloves. 
Its glove production in Malaysia has dropped and a plan for a $1 billion Hong Kong listing has been delayed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-top-glove-listing-hong-kong-idCAKCN2DD2AX since the ban.
The North American market accounts for 22% of Top Glove's total sales volume, according to most recent data.
IMPROVEMENTS AT TOP GLOVE
The CBP had prohibited imports of Top Glove products citing evidence of forced labour practices at the company, including debt bondage, excessive overtime, abusive working and living conditions, and retention of identity documents. 
While Top Glove said in April it had resolved all forced labour indicators, U.S. Customs had two of the company's shipments seized in May https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-seizes-shipment-malaysias-top-glove-over-forced-labour-concerns-2021-05-13/#:~:text=KUALA%20LUMPUR%2C%20May%2013%20(Reuters,labour%20allegations%2C%20U.S.%20customs%20said. 
Rights activist Andy Hall, who had urged the CBP to investigate Top Glove, said he welcomed the decision to lift the ban ""in light of the considerable improvements in foreign workers living and working conditions"" at Top Glove.
Top Glove has upgraded hostel facilities for its migrant workers, who account for a majority of its factory workforce, and promised to compensate them for the fee they paid to employment agents in their home countries. 
The fees result in debt bondage, labour activists say.

Rivals Hartalega Holdings and Kossan Rubber have also since said they would pay back the fees. 
Two other Malaysian firms have also been hit with U.S. bans in the last year - Sime Darby Plantation and FGV Holdings. The palm oil producers have both appointed auditors to evaluate their practices and said they would engage with CBP to address the concerns raised.

China, which claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, has pressured foreign companies to refer to the island as Chinese territory, often using the terminology ""Taiwan, China"", which they generally do to avoid losing access to the enormous Chinese market.
Fitch's press release used the expression ""Taiwan, China"" three times, including in the headline, though the statement did make other references to Taiwan without the addition of the word China.
Taiwan's Finance Ministry expressed ""deep regret"" at the name change and asked Fitch to revert to its previous convention of just using the word ""Taiwan"".
""The ministry will continue to talk to the company to get them to acknowledge this problem,"" it added.
A spokesperson for Fitch Ratings said: ""The change to our naming convention for Taiwan was an operational decision"". It did not elaborate.
The statement was otherwise positive for Taiwan, with Fitch upgrading it to 'AA' from 'AA-' with a stable outlook, saying the economy had outperformed its peers during the coronavirus pandemic.
Fitch is not the only ratings agency to refer to Taiwan in this way. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) also uses the formulation ""Government of Taiwan, China"" in some of its communications.
China's claims over Taiwan are a frequent source of anger in Taiwan, whose people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic Beijing.

The People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, and its government has no say in how the island is governed.

The probe, disclosed by the company on Aug. 1, is focused on Allianz funds that used complex options strategies to generate returns but racked up massive losses when the spread of COVID-19 triggered wild stock market swings in February and March 2020.
The DOJ is looking into whether managers at Allianz Global Investor's Structured Alpha Funds abandoned a strategy to provide protection against market crashes and how they communicated the amount of risk to investors, the sources said. 
The DOJ and Allianz declined to comment on the nature of the investigation, which could lead to criminal charges.
The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a probe into the demise of the funds last year, Allianz disclosed after the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System filed a lawsuit in July 2020 seeking $774 million in damages.
Since then, at least 25 investor lawsuits, predominantly by U.S. public pension funds, including those for New York subway workers and city of Milwaukee employees, have been filed against Allianz for a total of about $6 billion in damages.
The company is seeking to have the lawsuits dismissed arguing that it is not liable for the investors' losses.
The DOJ launched its probe after a referral from the SEC while German financial regulator BaFin has also been looking into the demise of the Structured Alpha Funds, Reuters reported this week.
In addition to its insurance business, the German company is one of the world's biggest money managers with 2.4 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) in assets under management through fixed-income investment giant PIMCO and Allianz Global Investors.
'MASSIVE SETBACK'
Allianz said in August it had reassessed the risks relating to the funds in light of the DOJ investigation and concluded the matter could have a material impact on its future results. 
Berenberg, which rates Allianz a ""buy"", has estimated the worst-case hit for the insurer could be 6.8 billion euros ($8 billion) - equivalent to its net profit last year - if it loses all the lawsuits and is fined by U.S. authorities.
""It's a massive setback for Allianz,"" Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka, a top Allianz investor, told Reuters. ""It begs the question to what extent Allianz as an insurer should get involved in asset management and the offering of complicated products.""
In a motion to dismiss filed in February 2021, Allianz's lawyers argue that the institutions were highly sophisticated investors and had been warned the strategies were speculative. 
Yet the investors argue in their lawsuits that the collapse of the Structured Alpha Funds was the result of Allianz deviating from its stated strategy of providing protection against market falls with put options.
In a February 2020 presentation shown in one investor lawsuit, Allianz Global Investors marketed the $15 billion family of Alpha funds stating: ""Today we are as prepared as ever in the event of a severe market dislocation.""
By the end of March that year, two funds worth a combined $2.3 billion at the end of 2019 had been liquidated after losing much of their value and investors such as Arkansas Teachers began getting out of the other Alpha funds nursing heavy losses.
Investor lawsuits argue that Allianz Global Investors had said it would always buy more put options to protect against market falls than the amount of put options it sold to earn premium income, but did not maintain that approach.
""The key wrongdoing here that we allege is the abandonment of the trading strategy. They said they were going to do this strategy; they didn't do it,"" one plaintiff's lawyer told a New York judge at a pre-trial meeting, according to a transcript.
In its motion to dismiss, Allianz said the funds had broad discretion to change investment strategies without prior consent or notice. 
Steep losses https://graphics.reuters.com/ALLIANZ-LITIGATION/klvykkgeevg/chart.png 
HORRIBLE WEEK
The two funds that shut had aimed to outperform a three-month U.S. Treasury bill index by 10% or more a year. Other Alpha funds aimed to outperform U.S. or global stock indexes by 2.5%, 3.5% or 5% a year by using various options strategies.
However, one of the funds, the Global Equity 500, lost 78% in the first quarter of 2020 while the benchmark it was measured against fell 22%, according to the Arkansas lawsuit.
The Arkansas lawsuit also cites options positions data for the U.S. Equity 250 fund on Feb. 29, 2020 showing it would be exposed to losses in the event of fall in the S&P 500 Index and an increase in the VIX volatility index.
Just a few weeks later, the S&P had slumped by a quarter since the end of February and the VIX had more than doubled.
Arkansas, which had $1.6 billion in three Alpha funds at the end of 2019, opted to shift what was left of its investments to rival asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in April 2020, minutes of an Arkansas retirement plan board meeting show.
Allianz has declined to reveal what is left in the Alpha funds that were not liquidated.
Reiner Kloecker, a fund manager with Union Investment, another of Allianz's largest shareholders, said the DOJ investigation, ""reinforces the suspicion of blatant internal misconduct or a lack of control processes"".
Speaking on Aug. 6, a few days after Allianz announced the DOJ investigation, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete said it had been a horrible week for him and the insurer.
Baete said that the events had nothing to do with Allianz Group's capabilities, culture or ethics. ""Not everything went perfectly with the fund management,"" he told reporters.
Meanwhile, the fallout in Arkansas continues.
A committee of the state's legislature that oversees public retirement added the losses to the agenda of a September meeting, Senator Kim Hammer, who co-chairs the committee, said. 
He told Reuters the committee would look at the investment policies of the Arkansas fund and whether Allianz was, ""a company we should have been involved with in the first place"".

Investing.com – American Outdoor stock (NASDAQ:AOUT) traded nearly 5% lower as the company’s reaffirmation of its annual outlook was found underwhelming.
The company sticking to its previous outlook left traders surprised since other statements it made suggested a more positive year. It said it is building up its inventory in anticipation of upcoming product launches and to mitigate supply chain risks.
The maker of products for hunting, camping and fishing closed the July quarter with inventories of $92 million, higher by 24%.
The company expects full-year net sales to grow by roughly 4% to $287.5 million. Adjusted per share is seen around $2.14.
Net sales in the first quarter rose by around a fifth to $60.8 million as people began to indulge after the monotony of a pandemic year.
Net profit almost doubled to $3.5 million from $1.8 million last year. Both sales and earnings beat estimates."

The Chinese embassy's suggestion, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry, came in the same week that Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Australia must diversify its economy to rely less on China, its largest trading partner, and warned businesses to brace for new tensions with it. [L1N2Q70J7]
Since the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership was signed by 11 nations including Australia in 2018, Britain, China, Taiwan and Thailand have signalled interest in joining it.
The Chinese embassy said in its submission that China and Australia's economies have enormous potential for cooperation.
It said a China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) signed in 2015 had led to rapid development of their relationship, dispute settlement mechanisms, and last year 95% of tariffs had been eliminated. 
However, many of the Australian agricultural goods listed in the Chinese submission faced customs disruptions or Chinese dumping inquiries in 2020, which have been widely interpreted in Australia as politically motivated, after Australia called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.
""It is no secret that China has recently sought to target Australia's economy,"" Frydenberg said in a speech in Canberra on Monday.
Australia's foreign affairs and trade department told the inquiry that expanding membership of the CPTPP beyond the 11 original signatories would help Australia diversify its export markets. 

Exports to China hit a record A$19.4 billion in the month of July, up 72% from a year earlier, on the back of strong iron ore demand.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>","Canadian Liberals' promised hike in bank taxes could lead to job cuts, higher borrowing costs","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - A campaign pledge by Canada's ruling Liberals to raise corporate taxes on banks to help pay for pandemic relief could lead to job cuts and higher borrowing costs as the lenders take steps to protect their profits, investors and political analysts said.
Seeking an edge in a tight race ahead of the Sept. 20 election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month his party, if re-elected, would hike the net tax rate on the country's most profitable banks and insurance companies to 18% from 15% on all earnings over C$1 billion ($792 million), generating C$2.5 billion a year over four years.
Trudeau said that given the banks' big profits, ""we're going to ask them to do a little bit more"" to help deal with the country's recovery from the pandemic. His government has run up record deficits dealing with COVID-19, drawing fire from the main opposition Conservatives, who hold a narrow lead in opinion polls.
But if the tax hikes are enacted, the biggest lenders, which would be the most affected, could respond by cutting jobs and raising borrowing costs, while the reduced earnings could hit retirees, investors said.
""The banks employ, across the board, well over 100,000 people. If their taxes are going up, maybe the banks fire more people,"" said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, who holds bank shares. 
""Is that what they want?"" Teich said of the Liberals.
The lower earnings resulting from the increased payments would also weigh on banks' stocks that ""so many retired Canadians rely on for dividends,"" he added.
The Canadian bank stocks index is down 3.3% since it peaked at a record before the Aug. 25 announcement, compared with a 0.7% rise in the benchmark Toronto index.
Banks are among the most profitable companies in Canada, with the biggest lenders topping earnings expectations for their just-reported third quarter. They paid C$12.7 billion in taxes in 2019, employing more than 280,000 people, according to the Canadian Bankers Association.
But Canada's combined federal-provincial corporate tax rate of 26.5% is the third lowest in the Group of Seven, after the UK and the United States, data from the Tax Foundation showed.
Abacus polling shows at least 70% of Canadians feel large corporations and wealthy individuals do not pay their fair share in taxes.
'TOO NEBULOUS' 
The higher tax could lower cumulative fiscal 2021 earnings at Canada's Big Six banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) - by 2%, with taxes paid increasing by C$1.3 billion, National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine said in a note. 
The impact on the biggest life insurers would be capped at 0.4%, Dechaine said. 
The Liberals' proposal also includes a special dividend, which could equal over C$1 billion a year over four years, he added.
""This part of the Liberal proposal is the most confusing, as it equates to a special dividend paid to the Federal Government out of shareholders' equity,"" Dechaine said.
The banks either did not respond or declined to comment.
The move could also benefit large corporations at the expense of smaller borrowers. 
""It's unlikely (the banks will) push the costs onto larger borrowers like corporations that have more power,"" said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. ""The tax increases will be passed on to customers who are relatively more inelastic in demand."" 
The move may not achieve the voter support the Liberals hope for, said Mike Van Soelen, managing principal of consulting firm Navigator. 
The Liberals' proposal is ""too nebulous and far removed from the average person,"" unlike other parties' calls for moves such as tackling bank fees, which resonate more, he said. 
Duff Conacher, co-founder of advocacy group Democracy Watch, said other measures, including more transparency about lending practices and limits on rate rises must be implemented alongside the tax increase for it to be effective. Its temporary nature also limits its impact, he said. 

As things stand, ""I'd rather see the banks put the money they’re going to pay in tax to work lending to people who have been discriminated against in lending rather than go into government coffers,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Singapore-based gaming and e-commerce company Sea Ltd has raised about $6 billion in an equity and convertible bond sale, making it Southeast Asia's largest fund raising.
The company priced 11 million American Depository Receipts https://refini.tv/3E3K4VS at $318 each, together with $2.5 billion in a convertible bond.
Sea operates the popular e-commerce site Shopee, which has been expanded through Asia and Latin America, and the company is pushing into Europe https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/seas-shopee-debut-europe-with-poland-launch-sources-2021-09-07 by opening in Poland, Reuters reported.
Shares of Sea, Southeast Asia's most valuable listed company by market capitalisation, were up 1.6% in pre-market trade on Friday. The stock is 62% higher for the year.
The deal was the largest fundraising in Southeast Asia, according to Refinitiv data.
""Given the huge level of investor interest in tech stocks and with interest rates so low, it's always good to bulk up finances,"" said one source familiar with the transaction.
Sea's shares recorded a nearly five-fold jump last year amid strong demand as pandemic-related restrictions kept people indoors.
For the quarter to June, Sea's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for its digital entertainment business rose to $741 million, up 71% year on year.
If the over-allotment is exercised on the share sale and convertible bond issuance, the amount raised would climb to $6.9 billion, Sea's regulatory filings showed, which would be the largest raising by an Asian company listed in the United States.
The sale was the second for the company in less than a year after the company in December raised $2.6 billion.
At $318, the price set was a 1.4% discount to its trading price ahead of the deal's launch in New York on Wednesday.
In its filings, Sea said it planned to use the cash for strategic investments and potential acquisitions.

But one analyst questioned the need to raise funds given the company had $7 billion on its balance sheet at the end of June.
""The reason for this fund raising could be an early indication that the gaming business is no longer capable of funding the e-commerce and fintech growth,"" Lightstream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri said.

1483,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>","Dow Futures 170 Pts Higher; PPI Data, Food Delivery Companies in Focus","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, rebounding after recent weakness, but still seen posting weekly losses as investors fret about the ongoing Covid outbreak derailing the economic recovery.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 170 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 65  points, or 0.4%.
The major indices on Wall Street are set to close a holiday-shortened week on a positive note, helped by the news that U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held their first talks in seven months late Thursday, in an attempt to improve relations between the globe’s two economic superpowers.
However, these gains follow several days of selling, and all three averages are set to end the week in the red, amid concerns the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases over the summer will stunt the country’s economic rebound. 
The Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book, a survey of recent economic conditions, that the U.S. economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August. This comes with the market still searching for more clarity about when the central bank will begin tapering its bond-buying program.
Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) see a risk that equities will sell off further, given the combination of high valuations and a rapidly advancing earnings cycle.
“Valuation corrections don’t always require market pullbacks, but they do constrain returns,” the bank’s analysts said, in a note. “With the current cycle advancing very quickly, the risk that the correction is hard is growing.” 
The major data release Friday comes in the form of U.S. producer prices, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). These are expected to have cooled in August, expected to rise by 0.6% after the 1% jump in July, providing weight to the Federal Reserve’s argument that the hefty price rises will be temporary in nature.
In corporate news, the second-quarter earnings season is largely over, but grocery chain giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) is set to release its results before the open.
Additionally, the food delivery companies, Uber (NYSE:UBER), GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), will be in the spotlight after they announced that they were suing New York City over its law that permanently caps the commissions their apps can charge restaurants for their services.
Crude prices traded higher Friday, rebounding after the previous session’s losses following the news China sold crude from its strategic reserves via public auction.
The move, believed to be a first, adds more uncertainty to a market struggling to cope with increasing Covid-19 cases and with offshore oil production still sharply curtailed in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $69.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.8% to $72.71. Both Brent and WTI futures settled at their lowest levels since Aug. 26 on Thursday.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,796.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1832.

""It's a combination of the coronavirus and semiconductors, but at the moment it is the coronavirus that is having the overwhelming impact,"" Kazunari Kumakura, an executive at the world's biggest car maker, said after the company revised its production target. 
Unlike other big global automakers that were forced earlier to scale back production plans, Toyota had managed to avoid cuts to output because it had stockpiled key components along a supply chain hardened against disruption following northeast Japan's devastating earthquake in 2011.
The Japanese carmakers' announcement on Friday is a further sign that no part of the global car industry has escaped the affects of a pandemic that has sapped sales and is hobbling the their ability to take advantage of the recovery in demand that followed the initial waves of COVID-19. 
Car sales in China in August fell by almost a fifth from a year earlier because there were fewer vehicles for people to buy. 
Toyota now expects to build 9 million vehicles in the year to March 31, rather than 9.3 million. It did not revise its 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion) operating profit forecast for the business year. 
Adding to a 360,000 vehicle cut in worldwide production in September, Toyota said on Friday it will reduce output by a further 70,000 this month and by 330,000 in October. It hopes to to make up some of that lost production before its year-end.
Demand for chips has soared during the pandemic as consumer electronic companies rush to meet stay-at-home demand for their smartphones, tablets and other devices.
A heavy reliance on Southeast Asian factories for parts is a headache for Toyota, but its also a problem for its rivals that have struggled with what Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) has described as ""very volatile and tight"" chip supplies.
The German carmaker has warned it may need to cut production further as a result. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co last month shut down production at a plant in Kansas that builds its best-selling F-150 pick up because of parts supply woes, with France Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) extending partial stoppages at factories in Spain.

German luxury carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) this month said it expects chip shortages to significantly lower third quarter sales.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China kicked off on Friday a long-awaited scheme, called Wealth Management Connect, that links its southern province of Guangdong with Hong Kong and Macau, as Beijing moves to pull the two territories closer.
The cross-boundary scheme will initially bring combined fund flows of 300 billion yuan ($46.53 billion) in the three areas together known as the Greater Bay Area (GBA), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said.
""The scheme will not only offer more investment options for individual GBA investors but also create new opportunities for the banking and wealth management industry in the three places,"" HKMA chief executive, Eddie Yue, said in a statement. 
It will also promote cross-border use of the Chinese currency, strengthening Hong Kong's role as the global hub for offshore yuan, Yue added.
Twenty Hong Kong banks have expressed interest in participating, said HKMA's deputy chief executive Edmond Lau.
""If the scheme proves popular we could increase the quotas so regulators will have a pragmatic approach,"" he told a media briefing.
Global banks and asset managers hailed the launch.
""The WMC scheme is a key milestone in China's financial market liberalisation,"" said Elisa Ng, Hong Kong head of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which has been preparing for the pilot program since it was announced in June last year. 
Sebastian Paredes, chief executive of DBS Hong Kong, expects the region to provide a quarter of the customers in the bank's Hong Kong Treasures Wealth programme over the next three years.
""We see immense opportunities in expanding our business into China,"" he added. 
Bank of China (Hong Kong) and the Private Wealth Management Association (PWMA) also welcomed the effort. 
""We look forward to engaging with relevant authorities on how to expand the scheme’s scope in the future,"" Amy Lo, who chairs the executive panel of the Association, said in a statement. 
EXTRA INCENTIVES
China's latest move to further open its financial markets comes ahead of the imminent launch of the southbound-leg of the Bond Connect for mainland investors to buy offshore debt. 
The programme enables residents of Hong Kong and Macau to buy mainland investment products sold by banks in the Greater Bay Area, while allowing residents of nine Guangdong cities to buy those sold by banks in the two offshore centres.
Eligible wealth management products for mainland investors in the scheme include deposits as well as equity and bond funds in Hong Kong, the HKMA said. 
Mainland China and Macau announced scheme implementation details separately. 
Initially, net cash flows in either direction must not exceed 150 billion yuan and the individual investment quota is 1 million yuan.
Similar previous initiatives include Stock Connect and Bond Connect, but Wealth Connect is the first cross-boundary scheme focused on the Greater Bay Area, whose combined gross domestic product is similar to that of Australia or South Korea. 
""We believe banks with strong onshore and offshore branches in the GBA will enjoy an advantage when leveraging this opportunity,"" Jasper Yip, a partner at consultancy Oliver Wyman, said this week. 
The news comes days after Beijing gave fresh impetus to developing the region, with new plans for two Guangdong cities, Qianhai and Hengqin.

In 2017, President Xi Jinping unveiled plans to turn the region into an economic powerhouse, and integration appears to be accelerating after China imposed a new security law in Hong Kong last year.

Investing.com –  Take-Two Interactive  Software stock (NASDAQ:TTWO) slipped 1% in Friday’s premarket after the video game publisher delayed the launch of enhanced versions of its franchise Grand Theft Auto by around five months.
Release of expanded versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, scheduled for November, will now take place in March. The franchise, widely acknowledged as one of the most popular of all time, is a cash-cow for the company.
Grand Theft Auto series has sold over 350 million units and Grand Theft Auto V 150 million so far since release.
The company said this will allow Rockstar Games, Take-Two’s fully-owned label, “additional time to further polish the final products”.

""In addition, STIKO expressly recommends vaccination against COVID-19 for those of child-bearing age who are not yet or incompletely vaccinated, to ensure very good protection against this disease before pregnancy,"" the guidance added.
Numerous countries have this year recommended that pregnant have COVID-19 vaccinations after finding them to be safe.
The European Medicines Agency said in July that data seen so far did not suggest any safety concerns, and in August the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that pregnant women should be vaccinated.
Germany is administering two vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology - one made by local startup BioNTech in partnership with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and a second from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
""Even pregnant and breastfeeding women now have a clear recommendation for vaccination,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn said.
""My urgent request to all pregnant and breastfeeding women: Ask your doctor. Get vaccinated. You are protecting yourself and your child.""

Germany's vaccine drive is lagging behind efforts in France, Spain and Portugal, leading RKI chief Lothar Wieler to warn this week of a ""massive"" fourth wave of infections this autumn if its pace is not stepped up.
Germany has fully vaccinated 73% of adults, compared to 71% across the European Union as a whole, official figures show.

Investing.com – Shares of food delivery companies were trading firm in Friday’s premarket as they sued New York City over its law that permanently caps the commissions the apps can charge restaurants for their services.
DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) was up 1% and Uber (NYSE:UBER) 0.6%. ADRs of Just Eat Takeaway (NASDAQ:GRUB), which completed the acquistion of Grubhub in June, were up 1.3%.
The limit on fees has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars through July, the companies said in the suit filed in federal court in New York.
Seeking an injunction against the order, the companies argue that a cap will need rewriting contracts with restaurants, reduce their ability to market and promote in the city and raise costs for consumers.
The fee cap is harmful and constitutes government overreach, according to the companies.
The cap, first imposed on a temporary basis during the pandemic, was made permanent last month by New York City. It said food-delivery companies are prohibited from charging restaurants more than 23% per order, accounting for delivery, listing on the app and credit-card fees.

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 04:54AM ET</span>",Europe Carry Trades Live On as ECB Delays Taper Talk to December,"(Bloomberg) -- The message from the European Central Bank is that it’s in no rush to scale back stimulus, giving the region’s bond market a license to rally.
The yield premium on 10-year Italian bonds over German equivalents -- a key gauge of risk appetite -- narrowed by the most since May after President Christine Lagarde on Thursday said the ECB would delay a decision over when to end its pandemic bond-buying program, or PEPP, to December.
While she was widely expected to tread carefully in telegraphing any reduction to stimulus, she surprised markets by explicitly pegging a move to the last policy decision of the year, effectively turning next month’s meeting into a non-event. 
That’s encouraging traders to pile into carry trades -- a strategy that involves buying higher-yielding bonds to collect the coupon payments -- safe in the knowledge that the outlook is unlikely to change for the coming months.
“I found it remarkable that she explicitly said December and basically ruled out late October,” said Christoph Rieger, the head of fixed-rate strategy at Commzerbank AG, who expects the pandemic bond buying program to be extended next year. That should drive the 10-year Italian-German yield spread to 75 basis points, a level last seen more than a decade ago, he said.
Lagarde also signaled a moderate decrease in monthly purchases for now. Still, the ECB will continue to purchase more bonds than issued by euro-area governments through year-end, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), keeping a lid on yields.
Italy’s 10-year yield premium over its German counterpart was steady at 103 basis points at 8:03 a.m. in London, after dropping more than four basis points on Thursday. 
“The main winners are carry traders in our view, as they can look to a quieter autumn,” wrote Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING Bank NV. “Only a further acceleration of inflation can upset this state of play in our view.”

1492,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>","European Stocks Higher; ECB Decision, Asian Gains Help","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, with investors digesting the European Central Bank’s policy decision and the latest U.K. growth figures.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
Investors have generally reacted positively to Thursday’s news that the European Central Bank will slow its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, seeing the move as only a token step towards unwinding the emergency economic aid that propped up the bloc during the pandemic.
Also helping the tone was a positive handover from Asia, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbing nearly 2%, boosted by a rebound in Chinese gaming stocks, while news of a call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden offered hope of better relations between the two economic superpowers.
However, gains are likely to be limited after the latest U.K. gross domestic product release showed the country grew just 0.1% on the month in July, a sharp drop from the 1.0% growth the previous month. The month was marked by the so-called 'pingdemic' that forced thousands of workers to self-isolate for lengthy periods.
The figures left output 2.1% below the level in February 2020, before the pandemic struck.
In corporate news,  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 0.8% after the Swiss cement maker agreed to sell its Brazilian unit to Companhia Siderurgica Nacional for about $1 billion, cutting its debt.
Additionally, Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) stock dropped 3.6% after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) downgraded its rating on the stock to ""sell"" from “neutral”, citing rising Covid-19 patient volumes and costs.
Crude prices traded higher Friday, rebounding after the previous session’s losses following the news China sold crude from its strategic reserves via public auction.
The move, believed to be a first, was undertaken “to ease the pressure of rising raw material prices,” according to the country’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, and adds more uncertainty to a market struggling to cope with increasing Covid-19 cases.
Still, U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week by 1.5 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration on Thursday, and almost 1.4 million barrels per day of offshore oil production remains shut in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $69.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $72.62. Both Brent and WTI futures settled at their lowest levels since Aug. 26 on Thursday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,803.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1842.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Harvard University to end investment in fossil fuels,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) -Harvard University is ending its investments in fossil fuels, the school's president said on Thursday, drawing praise from divestment activists who had long pressed the leading university to exit such holdings.
In a letter posted on Harvard's website, President Lawrence Bacow said the school's endowment had no direct investments in fossil fuel exploration or development companies as of June and will not make such investments in the future, ""given the need to decarbonize the economy.""
The university's indirect investments in the fossil fuel industry ""are in runoff mode,"" he added. The indirect investments, made through private equity funds, make up less than 2% of the endowment, Bacow wrote.
Recently valued at about $42 billion, the most of any university, the school's endowment has been under pressure for years from students, alumni and other activists to sell off its fossil fuel holdings as a way to slow climate change. 
Others have called such moves only posturing. In May an activist fund took a different tack and won three seats on ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp's board, vowing to reform the leading oil company's climate record.
Representatives for the Cambridge, Massachusetts school did not immediately provide further details. 
For most of the past decade previous Harvard officials had resisted calls to sell fossil fuel stocks but more recently changed course under new leaders including Bacow, president since 2018. 

Internal pressure for divestment has also grown, including from young members elected to one of Harvard's leadership boards last year on a divestment platform.
Divest Harvard, one of the activists groups, on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) described the move as ""a massive victory for our community, the climate movement, and the world -- and a strike against the power of the fossil fuel industry.""

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>",Chinese firms with offshore structure to need approval for Hong Kong IPOs -sources,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's securities regulator is looking to expand its scrutiny of overseas listings by offshore incorporated companies to include initial public offerings (IPO) in Hong Kong, five people with knowledge of the matter said.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has already been setting up a team https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-targets-offshore-ipo-structure-require-ministry-approval-sources-2021-07-08 to focus on companies seeking to list offshore using the so-called variable interest entity (VIE) corporate structure which Beijing says has led to abuse.
But some market participants had not expected the scrutiny to be extended to such firms seeking to list in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong - a preferred venue for companies in the world's second-largest economy to raise capital offshore.
However, under the new rules being drafted, CSRC will not exclude Hong Kong-bound Chinese companies with a VIE structure from seeking approval, the people told Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the change.
The move would not augur well for the Asian financial hub as it may make it more challenging for Chinese firms looking for a venue closer to home amid tighter checks in the United States - another top destination for offshore floats.
The proposed changes are part of China's months-long crackdown https://www.reuters.com/world/china/education-bitcoin-chinas-season-regulatory-crackdown-2021-07-27 on private firms to rein in ""disorderly expansion of capital"" that has involved behemoths like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Ant Group and ride-hailing giant Didi.
There is no timeline for the unveiling of the new guidelines, the sources added.
CSRC did not respond to a request for comment, while Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX), the operator of the local bourse, and the markets regulator Securities and Futures Commission declined to comment. 
VIE STRUCTURE
The VIE structure was created two decades ago to circumvent rules restricting foreign investment in sensitive industries such as media and telecommunications, enabling Chinese companies to raise funds overseas via offshore listings.
It has been widely adopted by China's new economy companies, mainly internet firms, that are generally incorporated in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands and therefore fall outside Beijing's legal jurisdiction.
Under the existing rules, Chinese companies with a VIE structure do not have to seek formal regulatory approvals for IPOs in the United States or in Hong Kong, and can bypass the scrutiny and lengthy IPO vetting process that locally-incorporated companies have to go through.

There have been $35.3 billion worth of IPOs in Hong Kong in 2021, of which Chinese companies accounted for 96.3%, according to Refinitiv data. The value of deals is up from $22.76 billion from a year earlier, the data showed.
Separately, HKEX has also increased scrutiny of Chinese IPO candidates that now face more queries on potential regulatory issues, said two of the sources, who advise some of those companies.

The ""ultra-affordable"" smartphone, developed jointly by Reliance's telecom arm and Google, was set to be rolled out from Sept. 10.
Companies globally are tackling a massive semiconductor shortage as the COVID-19 pandemic-led shift to remote working drove demand for the critical component used in making laptops and phones. As a fallout, several automakers have also suspended production. 
""Both the companies have begun testing JioPhone Next with a limited set of users for further refinement and are actively working to make it available more widely in time for the Diwali festive season,"" Jio said in an exchange filing https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/e186d89b-7499-4163-bf5e-bdfcfcc8bdae.pdf late on Thursday.
The annual festive season in India typically lasts for 30 days, beginning in October and ending with Diwali — set for Nov. 4 this year. Indians usually make big-ticket purchases from jewellery to gadgets and cars around this period.
The additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide global semiconductor shortages, Jio added.
In June, when the phone was announced, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani did not specify its price but said it will be the most affordable smartphone ""not just in India, but globally"".

Jio disrupted India's telecom market in 2016 when it launched with cut-price data plans and free voice services, forcing several competitors out of the market. It is now India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 425 million customers.
Ambani had also said in June that Jio, which counts Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) among its backers, was confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India.

""The digitalization of financial markets continues apace, and while the final shape of the market is still evolving, this is an important milestone in providing institutional investors with a safe and robust infrastructure,"" SIX's global head of exchanges Thomas Zeeb said in a statement.
The green light from regulator FINMA also grants SIX approval to operate a central securities depository for digital assets, the exchange said.
Plans for the new SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) trading platform were unveiled in 2018, early in the cryptocurrency boom brought about by bitcoin and other projects and as financial markets first became interested in its underlying blockchain technology.
Its launch was initially slated for the second half of 2019. SIX did not say when the platform was currently expected to go live.
SDX is to run on distributed ledger technology, a digital system for recording asset transactions across multiple sites inspired by blockchain. 
The exchange said on Friday it sees the platform creating a global exchange network for digital assets as the customer base for such assets expands to include banks, issuers, insurance firms and institutional investors.

SIX officials previously said SDX was likely to offer trading in selected stocks, followed by other stocks and later bonds and possibly exchange-traded funds. 
They held out the prospect that other assets - such as paintings or vintage cars - could also one day change hands on SDX in the form of tokens.

Investors have generally reacted positively to Thursday’s news that the European Central Bank will slow its emergency bond purchases in the fourth quarter, seeing the move as only a token step towards unwinding the emergency economic aid that propped up the bloc during the pandemic.
“It is not tapering but a very tentative sign that tapering could eventually come,” said analysts at ING, in a note.
Also helping the tone was a positive handover from Asia, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbing nearly 2%, boosted by a rebound in Chinese gaming stocks after Thursday’s heavy losses on a report that the Chinese government will suspend approvals for new online games.
However, gains are likely to be limited after the latest U.K. gross domestic product release showed the country grew just 0.1% on the month in July, a sharp drop from the 1.0% growth the previous month.
“After many months during which the economy grew strongly, making up much of the lost ground from the pandemic, there was little growth overall in July,” said Jonathan Athow, at the Office for National Statistics. 
In corporate news, the airline stocks could be in focus Friday the day after easyJet (LON:EZJ) announced it had rejected a takeover approach, believed to be from Hungarian discount rival Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ).

Investing.com – Malaysia’s  Top Glove Corporation Bhd  (KL:TPGC) saw its shares jump after the resumption of its U.S. exports from Sep. 10 onwards.
Shares were up 2.65% to MYR3.49 ($0.84) by 12:54 AM ET (4:54 AM GMT) after rising as much as 10%, the biggest surge in five months, earlier in the session. They have dropped 48% since the ban in mid-July 2020 until Thursday.
The company had been under a U.S. import ban since July 2020 over allegations that it abused migrant workers. The timing of the ban came as the company made record profits thanks to COVID-19 demand.
However, a company statement said Top Glove had been cleared to resume U.S. sales and remains committed to workers’ health, safety and well-being. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also said it will revoke the ban in a notice posted on the Federal Register website.
“CBP has now determined, based upon additional information, that such merchandise is no longer being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,” the notice said.
The impact for Top Glove is only positive, according to some investors.
“We believe that the removal of the ban would boost Top Glove revenue, which have suffered since shipments by Top Glove’s Malaysia to the U.S. halted temporarily,” TA Securities analyst Tan Kong Jin said in a note.
Top Glove’s North America sales dropped to 8% suring the fiscal third quarter ended May from 23% in the fiscal second quarter ended February, according to Tan."

The new body was set up in response to recommendations by a 2018 inquiry into misconduct in the banking, insurance and pension fund sectors where regulators were criticised https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-banks-inquiry-regulator-idUSL4N1V81BL for their ""light touch"" on enforcement.
At the time, the corporate regulator told the Royal Commission inquiry https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-banks-inquiry-idUSKCN1NR09T that funding cuts and an increasing mandate had hampered its ability to prevent wrongdoing in the financial sector, and slammed bank bosses for failing to properly respond to its inquiries. 
Craig Drummond, a former veteran banker with National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY), and former country head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) will also be an inaugural member of the Financial Regulator Assessment Authority (FRAA).
The new three-person regulatory body, including corporate lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb, will supervise both the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (APRA).
""The inaugural members have an in-depth understanding of Australia's regulatory framework and first-hand experience working with ASIC and APRA over many years ... which will assist in their assessment of the operational performance of both ASIC and APRA,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement. 
In its first year, the group would evaluate the corporate regulator to assist its recently appointed chair, former lawyer Joseph Longo, to ensure ASIC is operating effectively and consistently with the government's expectations, he added.
Those include an expectation for ASIC to prioritise its contribution to the government's economic goals, including a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Appearing at a regular parliamentary hearing, Longo said he looked forward to working with the members of FRAA towards meeting the government's expectations.
APRA chair Wayne Byres also said ""we look forward to working with them to further refine and enhance the effectiveness of our supervision of the banking, insurance and superannuation industries.""

(Reuters) -The Illinois House late on Thursday passed an energy bill with nearly $700 million in incentives for two  Exelon Corp  (NASDAQ:EXC) nuclear power plants, taking the legislature one step closer to saving the plants the company has threatened to close starting on Monday. 
""What the House has accomplished tonight is monumental and life changing for the future generations of Illinois,"" said House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, a Democrat. ""Illinois is on the path to a greener future that prioritizes a reduction in carbon emissions, saves jobs, diversifies the energy sector and tackles necessary ethics reform."" 
While nuclear power plants create toxic waste for which there is still no permanent repository in the United States, they are also praised by some environmentalists and politicians because they generate large amounts of power virtually emissions-free. They also tend to provide some of the energy industry's highest paying jobs. 
Senate President Don Harmon, a Democrat, said the Senate is scheduled to return on Monday to ""advance this vital proposal to the governor's desk so it can become law."" 
The United States has 93 nuclear reactors, more than any other country, but that's down from 104 in 2012 as aging plants struggle to compete with power generated by solar and wind farms and plants that burn natural gas.
Gina McCarthy, President Joe Biden's climate adviser, has said maintaining some of the existing nuclear plants is ""absolutely essential"" to hit U.S. goals to decarbonize the electric grid by 2035 and the administration has supported federal incentives for the nuclear industry.
As the Illinois bill languished for more than two years, Exelon had said it would close its Byron nuclear plant on Sept. 13 and Dresden in November if a state or federal program did not come to the rescue. 
The bill had been held up on disagreements between labor and environmental groups on when to close coal and natural gas plants. 
Exelon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House vote. 
An amendment that emerged this week helped seal the passage in the House. Under the measure, coal plants including Prairie State, the state's largest carbon emitter, are required to cut current emissions 45% by 2035 and to be 100% carbon free, or close, by Dec. 31, 2045. The plants can use any technology, including the burning of hydrogen produced by renewable power, to meet those levels.

The bill contains nearly $700 million in carbon mitigation credits over five years for three Exelon nuclear plants, including the Braidwood facility, which the company has said is at risk but has not scheduled a date to close. 
""I look forward to (the bill's) swift passage in the Senate, and signing it into law as soon as possible, because our planet and the people of Illinois ought not wait any longer,"" said Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat.

Top Glove said it remains committed to the health, safety and well-being of its workers. Shares rose as much as 10% in Malaysia, the biggest surge in five months.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection separately said it will revoke Top Glove’s import ban, according to a notice by the agency posted on the Federal Register website. 
“CBP has now determined, based upon additional information, that such merchandise is no longer being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,” according to the notice.

“We believe that the removal of the ban would boost Top Glove revenue, which have suffered since shipments by Top Glove’s Malaysia to the U.S. halted temporarily,” Tan Kong Jin, an analyst at Kuala Lumpur-based TA Securities, said in a note to clients on Friday.
Sales from North America at Top Glove dropped to 8% during its fiscal third quarter ended May from 23% in the fiscal second quarter ended February, according to Tan. Shares of Top Glove have dropped 48% since the import ban in mid-July 2020 until Thursday. It was up 5% to 3.58 ringgit per share at 10:25 a.m. local time.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 11:20PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers seek $1 billion to fund FTC privacy probes,"By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. House Democratic lawmakers on Thursday proposed awarding the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) $1 billion to set up a bureau dedicated to improving data security and privacy and fighting identity theft.
The proposal, which Democrats plan to include in a $3.5 trillion spending measure, would fund a new bureau over 10 years to address ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices relating to privacy, data security, identity theft, data abuses, and related matters,"" according to a summary released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
The committee will meet on Monday to take up the wide-ranging spending proposal that includes $30 billion to remove lead pipes and $13.5 billion for zero emissions vehicle infrastructure buildout.
Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said in a statement it was ""long past time that the FTC have the tools it needs to keep pace with the online marketplace and those who would undermine it.""
""Creating a privacy bureau is an important step in protecting consumers,"" she said, adding that a federal privacy and data security law that protects consumers and creates certainty for businesses is still needed.
The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, has picked up the job of pushing corporations to better protect consumer data and privacy as it enforces rules against deceptive practices.
For example, in 2020, it settled with Zoom over allegations that the company misled consumers about the level of security it provided. The company agreed to improve its security as part of a settlement.
The Energy and Commerce bill would also direct $3 billion for the costs of providing direct government loans to produce ""zero-emission medium and heavy-duty vehicles, trains or locomotives, maritime vessels, aircraft, or hyperloop technology."" 

It would direct $1 billion ""for domestic manufacturing conversion grants relating to domestic production of zero-emission vehicles.""
The bill also would spend $10 billion on supply chain resilience projects including ""demonstrating technological advances for critical manufacturing supply chains.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, as investors digested the latest European Central Bank (ECB) policy decision. Ongoing efforts to support the economic recovery from COVID-19 were also in focus as the week draws to a close.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.05% by 10:01 PM ET (2:01 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.29%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.32% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.50%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.57% while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.15%. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index took a tumble after Chinese technology companies in Asia saw their shares slide. Investors now await the next step in China’s regulatory tightening on a slew of private industries, as well as the next move to maintain the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
China also tapped its crude reserves in a move to cool down soaring energy costs, which contributed to oil’s move downwards.
Meanwhile, the ECB handed down its policy decision on Thursday. The central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 0% but indicated it would slow the pace of purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program in the fourth quarter of 2021.
However, ECB President Christine Lagarde assured markets that “the lady isn’t tapering”, with COVID-19 still posing a risk to economic recovery.
Some investors agreed with the ECB’s stance.
“Ultimately, the path back to a more normal economic environment is likely going to be long, and we can expect setbacks along the way. The recent slowdown could lead to further volatility in the months ahead,” Commonwealth Financial Network chief investment officer Brad McMillan said in a note.
Across the Atlantic, U.S. President Joe Biden is yet to announce whether he will re-nominate U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to a second term.
On the data front, data released on Thursday showed that Americans filed a total of 310,000 initial jobless claims throughout the week. The number was lower than both the 335,000 number in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 345,000 claims submitted during the previous week."
1509,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 08:56PM ET</span>","Corporate, union reaction to Biden vaccine plan for companies","(Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Thursday took aim at vaccine resistance in America, announcing policies requiring most federal employees to get COVID-19 vaccines and pushing large employers to have their workers vaccinated or tested weekly.
The new measures https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-new-covid-19-plan-includes-vaccine-test-mandates-2021-09-09/?enowpopup, which Biden laid out in remarks from the White House, would apply to about two-thirds of all U.S. employees, those who work for businesses with more than 100 workers.
A senior administration official said the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration would take enforcement actions against those that did not comply, with substantial fines of nearly $14,000 per violation.
Following are some of the latest reactions to the move.
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP
""As we have done throughout the pandemic, we continue to follow federal, state and local mandates, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to minimize the spread of COVID-19."" 
STATE STREET CORP
""In August, we announced that we will require all employees and contingent workers in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated in order to enter a  State Street  (NYSE:STT) building, as of September 13, 2021.""
UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION
A spokesman said the union is ""looking at the details of the announcement and how it impacts our over 700 employer contracts and our members."" UAW President Ray Curry last month said he supported only voluntary efforts to get employees vaccinated, and said any mandates would need to be agreed through negotiation. 
AMAZON.COM INC
""We know vaccines, coupled with widespread and convenient testing, serve as powerful tools to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, keeping the U.S. economy open, and protecting America’s workforce,"" said Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). ""We’re proud to work with the Biden administration to increase access to affordable, high-quality, FDA-authorized tests, to keep us moving toward a full recovery.”
AUTOMAKER STELLANTIS NV
“Since vaccines have become available, Stellantis has continued to strongly advocate for our employees to get vaccinated, including facilitating administration through our near-site clinics and in partnership with our local unions. We will review the Administration's announcement and discuss it with our partners.""
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
""Since the vaccines first became widely available, we have strongly encouraged all our members to take one of the several safe, effective vaccines against COVID-19,"" said American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley. ""The data are clear. Getting vaccinated isn’t just the best way for us to end this pandemic, it is the best way for us to protect each other in the workplace.""
""Likewise, since President Biden made his first major announcement about changing COVID-19 protocols for the federal workforce in response to the surging Delta variant, we have said that changes like this should be negotiated with our bargaining units where appropriate. Put simply, workers deserve a voice in their working conditions. Neither of these positions has changed. We expect to bargain over this change prior to implementation, and we urge everyone who is able to get vaccinated as soon as they can do so.”
RARE EARTHS PRODUCER MP MATERIALS CORP
MP Materials, which received a grant from the Pentagon last year to process the minerals used in weaponry and electronics, said it would review the president's order. ""We haven't yet seen the order and do not know what impact it will have. In general, we have acted throughout the pandemic to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees, including by encouraging and incentivizing vaccination,"" spokesman Matt Sloustcher said.
LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS
Regarding the legality of directing government contractors to get employees vaccinated, Steve Cave, an attorney at King & Spalding who represents government contractors, said the president will be seen as having greater authority over contractors sending employees to federal property, while contractors that do not perform work on government property will be more motivated to challenge the order.
Cave said there is precedent for Biden’s order. Former President Donald Trump banned from use by U.S. government contractors some Chinese technology which so far has survived challenges, he said.
MICROSOFT CORP
""We are requiring proof of vaccination for all employees and vendors entering Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) buildings in the U.S. We have an accommodation process in place for employees who have a medical condition or other protected reason, such as religion, which prevent them from getting vaccinated,” a spokesperson said.
National Association of Manufacturers 
“We look forward to working with the administration to ensure any vaccine requirements are structured in a way that does not negatively impact the operations of manufacturers that have been leading through the pandemic to keep Americans safe. It is important that undue compliance costs do not burden manufacturers, large and small alike,"" President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement.
“Getting all eligible Americans vaccinated will, first and foremost, reduce hospitalizations and save lives. But it is also an economic imperative in that our recovery and quality of life depend on our ability to end this pandemic.""
DELTA AIR LINES
""While we await the details of the administration’s plan, Delta is proud to have developed a vaccination program that has already seen 78% of employees get vaccinated. Our employee vaccination numbers continue to grow following the announcement of our healthcare premium surcharge starting in November, and weekly testing starting next week, for those employees who choose to remain unvaccinated.""
GRAPHICS CHIP MAKER NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) CORP
“The safety of our employees and their families is a top priority for NVIDIA. This is a topic that is being reviewed by our senior leaders and we have not yet made any decisions.”
FREIGHT RAILROAD OPERATOR UNION PACIFIC CORP

AUSTIN (Reuters) - A decision by Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) on the location of its new $17 billion U.S. chip plant was imminent, the judge for Texas' Williamson County, which is in the running for the new factory, said on Thursday.
""The decision is imminent. My experience with Samsung (KS:005930) is that they move nimbly and swiftly,"" County Judge Bill Gravell said during an interview with Reuters. 
Samsung has said it would start construction on the new 6-million-square-foot (557,418-sq-meter) plant in January, with production up and running by the end of 2024. The company has said no decision has been made and that it was also considering Williamson County's southern neighbor Austin and sites in New York and California.
The factory would mark Samsung's second U.S. chip factory and comes at a time when the global auto industry faces a significant semiconductor shortage.
Gravell is the county's top elected official and has been in charge of the local negotiations with Samsung. He said he was confident Samsung would pick their site, with the company already having started taking bore samples and commenced land survey, engineering and design work.
""In my heart I would like to think that we have the project,"" Gravell said.
The county, which is home to Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc's headquarters and a future Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) campus, has worked hard to woo Korean Samsung executives over the last eight months, Gravell said.
County officials in January presented Samsung executives with custom-printed jerseys at the local baseball stadium and finished a splashy video presentation with fireworks, the judge said.
Williamson County commissioners on Wednesday passed an extensive incentives package that would rebate Samsung 90% of property taxes for the first 10 years, and 85% for the following 10 years if the company meets certain construction deadlines and creates 1,800 full-time jobs.

Assessing the total rebate amount is complicated by the site's unknown future property value, Gravell said but added that the county would still earn more in taxes than it currently does from the land.
A separate property tax incentives deal with the city of Taylor would provide Samsung with $314 million in tax breaks over the next 10 years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Thursday it has 18 pending investigations against airlines over complaints that they failed to provide timely refunds during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The department said in a report to the White House it was still reviewing 30,100 complaints involving 18 airlines out of 20 investigations it had initially opened. It did not name the airlines.
""The department has devoted considerable time, energy, and effort to securing relief for consumers and holding airlines accountable,"" it said in the report.
The department noted it had concluded investigations into complaints involving Air Canada and United Airlines. 
In June, the department said it was seeking a $25.5 million fine from Air Canada over the carrier's failure to provide timely refunds to thousands of consumers who requested them for flights to or from the United States.
Air Canada has urged the department to dismiss the complaint saying the department's ""arbitrary conduct flatly contradicts years of well-established law.""
The department said on Thursday that settlement negotiations with Air Canada ""are continuing."" Air Canada did not immediately comment. 
In June, the Transportation Department said it was investigating the refund practices of an undisclosed number of U.S. and foreign carriers flying to and from the United States and would take ""enforcement action"" as appropriate.
The department said Thursday it is separately examining four foreign carriers that filed for bankruptcy protection and ""exploring options on how passengers who did not receive refunds when the carriers canceled their flights may be compensated.""
In January, the department ended its probe into United after the carrier ""took prompt corrective actions, resulting in thousands of passengers who had initially been denied refunds receiving the required refunds in or around June 2020.""
The Transportation Department is working to increase the number of staff handling consumer complaints by 38%.

The department said it plans to issue rules on refunds for consumers who are unable to travel due to government restrictions. Existing regulations do not address refund eligibility under special circumstances, such as government-imposed travel restrictions.
It also said at least 9 airlines that initially provided vouchers or credits instead of refunds for non-refundable tickets changed policies to make clear passengers are entitled to refunds under such circumstances and provided refunds as required.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc launched its first smart glasses on Thursday in a step toward its aim of offering true augmented-reality spectacles. 
The glasses, which were created in partnership with Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, allow wearers to listen to music, take calls or capture photos and short videos and share them across Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s services using a companion app. Facebook said the glasses line, called ""Ray-Ban Stories,"" would start at $299.
The social media giant, which reported revenue of about $86 billion in 2020, makes most of its money from advertising but has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on wristband technologies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-augmented-reality/facebook-developing-wristband-to-support-augmented-reality-glasses-idUSKBN2BA216 to support augmented reality glasses.
Facebook's chief scientist said last year the company was five to 10 years away from being able to bring to market ""true"" AR glasses, which would superimpose virtual objects onto the wearer's view of the real world. 
Major tech firms including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) have raced to develop various smart glasses products, but early offerings like Google Glass proved difficult to sell to consumers put off by high price points and design issues.
Snap, which unveiled its smart Spectacles in 2016, this year launched AR glasses but they are not for sale and are offered only to AR creators. Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in 2019 that he expected it would be a decade before consumers widely adopted AR smart glasses. 
Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently announced the company was setting up a team to work on building the metaverse https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26, a shared virtual environment which it is betting will be the successor to the mobile internet.
""We’ve believed for a long time that glasses are going to be an important part of building the next computing platform,"" said Zuckerberg in a video posted on his Facebook page on Thursday. 
Facebook, which has been criticized over its handling of user data https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-data-leak/facebook-does-not-plan-to-notify-half-billion-users-affected-by-data-leak-idUSKBN2BU2ZY, said it would not access the media used by its smart-glasses customers without their consent. 
The company also said it would not use the content of the photos or videos captured using the glasses and stored in the Facebook View app for personalizing ads, and said the glasses would be an ""ads-free experience."" 

The glasses include an optional virtual assistant so photos and videos can be captured hands-free through voice commands. Facebook said an LED light on the glasses would show when the camera is on, to make other people aware when a wearer is taking a photo or video. 
It published a guide outlining how to use the glasses responsibly, for example turning them off in private spaces like public bathrooms and not using them for illegal actions like harassment or capturing sensitive information such as PIN codes.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",White House COVID-19 test mandate could overwhelm already-strained suppliers,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - A White House plan to mandate COVID-19 vaccination or repeated testing for around two-thirds of U.S. workers announced on Thursday could be hampered by supply challenges as COVID-19 test manufacturers strain to keep pace with demand. 
U.S. President Joe Biden will require all federal employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the U.S. Department of Labor will issue a rule requiring private businesses with more than 100 employees to have their workers vaccinated or tested weekly, officials said on Thursday.
Around 25% of the approximately 255 million Americans 18 years of age and older have not yet received a COVID-19 shot, according to federal data. 
The White House said it will spend nearly $2 billion on 280 million rapid COVID-19 tests to help boost supply, but industry experts are doubtful that manufacturers can produce tests fast enough to keep up with the administration's mandate. 
The U.S. testing industry currently can only produce around 50 million rapid COVID-19 tests each month, said Vijay Kumar, an analyst at Evercore ISI who covers medical technology companies.
That's only enough tests to cover around 12 million people taking weekly tests. 
The White House said on Thursday it will employ a wartime law known at the Defense Production Act to help test manufacturers access needed supplies.
""It has to be a priority to increase the availability of tests,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.
""Rapid tests should’ve been available from the very start of this pandemic and the shortages now are unacceptable.""
The largest U.S. manufacturers of rapid COVID-19 tests - Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and Co, Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) Corp and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) - did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the White House's announcement. 
The Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group for testmakers, told Reuters that rapid point-of-care test supplies are still ramping up to meet demand although laboratory-based testing capacity is strong.
It added that it sent a letter to the administration in September requesting additional support for test production. 
U.S. companies have been already been straining to provide COVID-19 tests requested by K-12 schools around the country as they roll out surveillance programs going into the new school year.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) recently imposed limits on the number of at-home tests customers can buy.
The shortages have been compounded because testmakers shut down production lines earlier this year when demand for tests appeared to be slowing and COVID-19 cases were on the decline. 
Manufacturers have cautioned that supplies could be limited in the near term. 
""We’re seeing unprecedented demand as case rates rise,"" Abbott told Reuters in a statement in August. ""There will be some supply constraints over the coming weeks as increased capacity comes online.""

Kumar said that testmakers also need more clarity on how the new mandate will be funded, noting that it is unclear whether employers will be expected to pick up a portion of the costs. 
The supply issue ""won't be resolved until the test providers have some visibility on demand,"" Kumar said.

(Reuters) -Louisiana Gulf Coast grain exports are slowly ramping up after a nearly two-week halt due to damage from Hurricane Ida, with at least two large exporters loading vessels and power steadily being restored to other terminals, government and shipping sources said on Thursday.
More than 50 oceangoing vessels have lined up along the lower Mississippi River waiting to dock and be loaded with soybeans or grain, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data and industry vessel lineup summaries seen by Reuters.
Restoring shipments from the busiest U.S. grain export hub is welcome relief to markets rattled by the storm disruptions as worries about prolonged outages sent export costs soaring and stoked fears about global food inflation.
Cash premiums for corn and soybean barges shipped to the Gulf Coast for export rallied by as much as 15 cents a bushel on signs that exports were beginning to flow again. [GRA/F]
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co, one of the world's biggest grain traders, restarted operations on floating midstream rigs that transfer crops from barges onto bulk ships, according to a statement.
ADM expects Louisiana elevators in Ama and Reserve to resume operations by the end of the month, and repairs to an elevator in Destrehan, Louisiana, to take ""a few weeks longer,"" the statement said. It added that estimates show power will be restored in the area late next week.
The vessel Navios La Paix was docked at ADM's facility in Destrehan on Thursday and loading with grain bound for Central America, shipping data showed.
A large export terminal owned by Louis Dreyfus Co near Baton Rouge was loading a corn vessel bound for Mexico on Thursday after loading a soybean vessel over the weekend. Some midstream rigs have also resumed loading.
""Things are finally starting to move again, which is good because the harvest is coming. Hopefully we can catch up pretty quick,"" said a U.S. export trader, asking not to be named as he is not authorized to speak with media.
At least three of the region's nearly dozen terminals are still without power, including a CHS Inc facility in Myrtle Grove and a heavily damaged Cargill Inc terminal in Reserve, Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said.
 Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd's facility in Destrehan is ""still not operational"" and the company has no estimate yet as to when it will be back online, spokeswoman Daiana Bein Endruweit said.
Asia's grain and oilseed buyers were preparing for shipping delays of at least a month after the storm, traders and a miller said on Wednesday.
Barge-loading river elevators in the U.S. farm belt have been holding back downriver shipments of grain as hurricane damage is cleared and power is restored.
Just 258,000 tons of corn and soybeans were shipped through key river locks on the Mississippi River and its tributaries in the week ended Sept. 4, down 65% from the same week last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expects the bulk of shipping channel obstructions on the lower Mississippi to be removed by Sept. 21 and dredged by Sept. 23, Strain said.

Officials are currently restricting the number of barges that each towboat will be allowed to haul at one time through the area for safety, he said.
In another move toward recovery, CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF), one of world's biggest fertilizer producers, said it began restarting ammonia plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, after halting production there on Aug. 28.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's top climate official on Thursday said programs to accelerate the closure of coal-fired power plants are an ""absolutely critical part"" of fighting climate change but carry some risks. 
In an interview with Reuters, Treasury Climate Counselor John Morton endorsed a scheme being developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and private investors to buy up and retire coal plants early as a more difficult but necessary companion to ""sexier"" efforts to boost direct investments in clean energy projects and stop the financing of high carbon-emitting energy sources.
The emission reduction goals set by the Paris Agreement are impossible to achieve without early retirements of coal plants, he said.
""Financing the closure of something is not in the DNA of most development finance institutions or governments, but it is an absolutely critical piece of solving the climate problem,"" Morton said.
Reuters first reported the ADB's effort https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/exclusive-citi-hsbc-prudential-hatch-plan-asian-coal-fired-closures-sources-2021-08-03 with British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK), Citi and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Real Assets to conduct a feasibility study to begin acquiring coal plants to wind them down 10-15 years before the end of their useful lives. The group has set a goal of financing their first plant purchase in 2022.
The United States, Canada, Britain and Germany agreed https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/12/fact-sheet-g7-to-announce-joint-actions-to-end-public-support-for-overseas-unabated-coal-generation-by-end-of-2021 at a G7 summit in June to provide up to $2 billion to support the Climate Investment Funds' Accelerating Coal Transition program, which seeks to transition developing countries away from coal power. 
Morton, a former partner at climate change advisory and investment firm Pollination Group who also served in Obama administration climate roles, said there were still many details to work out in making such schemes viable. 
These include avoiding overpaying for assets and ensuring that public money does not crowd out changes that private sector will make on its own, especially with renewable energy becoming the low-cost power source. 
""The key question is how do you avoid paying for something that would happen anyway,"" Morton said. ""There's lots of debate around how best to do that right, so that you're not getting gamed in the process.""

Policymakers will have to figure out ways to do that, he said.
""If you can move forward the closure of a coal plant by five years with a bit of creative financing, that is a massive, massive contribution -- at usually a relatively low cost -- to the global economy.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department views ""debt for nature"" swaps as an attractive way to mobilize more capital to fight climate change and support emissions reductions goals, the department's top adviser on climate finance, John Morton, told Reuters.
Morton, top climate adviser to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, said in an interview such deals could be small and complex, but they could be useful tools to respond to the climate crisis.
Yellen in July convened Treasury's first-ever meeting with the World Bank and other multilateral development banks https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-treasurys-yellen-tells-development-banks-mobilize-private-capital-climate-2021-07-22 to brainstorm concrete plans to maximize capital by leveraging public dollars. 
Morton said they were making good progress on drafting plans ahead of mid-October, when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund hold their regular fall meetings.
The issue, he said, was to ""get the maximum climate bang for the lowest public buck. Ultimately this is about using scarce public dollars responsibly and enabling the private sector to invest wherever possible, to affect the climate outcomes we're looking for.""
Any climate strategy, including debt-for-nature and adaptation, needed to be assessed in terms of how much carbon abatement they achieved per dollar of public resources.
""Debt-for-nature represents some very attractive opportunities in that regard,"" he said. ""We do have programs within Treasury that do debt-for-nature swaps, and they're certainly part of the arsenal of tools that we look at as we think about responding to climate opportunities.""
Morton said Treasury was meeting regularly with the multilateral development banks on the reports requested by Yellen, and had been impressed so far with the work done since the July meeting. Yellen plans to reconvene the group in October on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 06:30PM ET</span>","Fox News, former anchor Henry must face ex-producer's sexual misconduct lawsuit","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Fox News and former anchor Ed Henry must face a lawsuit accusing Henry of promising career advancement to coerce an employee into a sometimes violent sexual relationship including rape, and accusing the network of allowing a hostile work environment, a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday.
U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan said that former associate producer Jennifer Eckhart could try to show Henry engaged in sex trafficking, and ""victim shamed"" her by posting what he claimed were nude photos of Eckhart in the court docket.
Abrams said Eckhart could also try to prove Fox News knew or should have known about Henry's harassing behavior, but not conduct related to alleged sex trafficking or the photos.
Separately, Abrams dismissed former on-air guest Cathy Areu's lawsuit accusing Henry and fellow Fox anchors Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Howard Kurtz of subjecting her to sexual harassment and a hostile environment, including demands she engage with them romantically and accept their ""misogynistic behavior.""
Abrams said Areu could not pursue some claims because she was not an employee, and did not show the anchors punished her for resisting their advances by reducing her airtime and hurting her career.
Henry's lawyer Catherine Foti said the Eckhart decision undermined her client's ""legitimate efforts to defend himself"" against claims he was confident would prove ""baseless.""
Fox News said it would defend against Eckhart's ""baseless"" claims against the network, saying it ""takes harassment allegations seriously and acted appropriately.""
Both lawsuits echoed earlier claims about sexual misconduct that led to the departures of Fox News founder Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY).
Fox News fired Henry in July 2020 after learning about Eckhart's accusations, including an alleged February 2017 rape in a Manhattan hotel room.
In a court filing, Henry said Eckhart ""willingly and enthusiastically"" engaged in their ""completely consensual"" relationship.
Eckhart said Fox News fired her in June 2020 after she complained about the work environment.
Michael Willemin, a lawyer for Eckhart, said she looked forward to a jury trial.

Areu's lawyer James Vagnini said his client was disappointed and would review whether to amend her complaint.
The cases, both in the same docket, are Eckhart v Fox News Network LLC et al and Areu v Fox News Network LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-05593.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Thursday after weekly jobless claims fell to a near 18-month low, allaying fears of a slowing economic recovery, but also stoking worries the Fed could move sooner than expected to scale back its accommodative policies. 
The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 310,000 for the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. That suggested that job growth could be hindered by labor shortages rather than cooling demand for workers. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) each declined about 1%, both among the stocks weighing most on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. 
The S&P 500 real estate and healthcare indexes each fell over 1% and were the poorest performers of 11 sectors, while financials , energy and materials .SPLRCM made modest gains. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Citi Group and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) each rose, tracking a slight rise in benchmark bond yields following the claims data. 
“The problem with the market these days is it’s rotating more than it’s moving. Today, because of the jobs claims report, everyone is buying cyclical stocks,"" said Jay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. “We see it as a rangebound market, between 4,400 and 4,600 (on the S&P 500).” 
Investors have become more worried in recent sessions after a recent monthly jobs report showed a slowdown in U.S. hiring, suggesting the economic recovery may be losing steam faster than expected. Also dragging on sentiment has been uncertainty about when the U.S. Federal Reserve's will scale back massive measures enacted last year to shield the economy from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43% to end at 34,879.38 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.46% to 4,493.28. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25% to 15,248.25. 
 Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) soared 10% after providing a strong annual forecast, as demand for its yoga pants remains strong despite the easing of coronavirus restrictions. 
Reports that Beijing slowed down approval for all new online video games sent shares of U.S.-listed gaming stocks Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Art Inc, and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc down more than 1%. 
Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) slid 5% after the data center REIT announced a public offering of 6.25 million shares. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.3 billion shares, compared with the 9.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 06:01PM ET</span>",GM's pickup money machine gets a technology tuneup,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will give its best-selling Chevrolet Silverado large pickup truck models a makeover next spring to fix competitive shortcomings that have left Chevy in third place in one of the most lucrative vehicle market segments in the world. 
Catching up with rival trucks from Stellantis NV and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, most 2022 Silverado models will get larger dashboard screens and new connectivity technology featuring built-in Google voice commands and software. 
Chevrolet also will add a 420-horsepower Silverado ZR2 designed for rugged off-road adventures - or to give the appearance that the owner would have them. The Silverado ZR2 will chase Ford's F-series Raptor and the Ram TRX from Stellantis, which are attention-getting performance models for those brands.
The current Silverado, launched in early 2019, has been outflanked in sales by rival Stellantis NV's Ram pickup. The Ram in 2018 got a makeover with a more refined interior and a 12-inch (30.5 cm) dashboard screen that was closer in style to a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S sedan than a conventional pickup truck. 
The Fiat Chrysler unit of what is now Stellantis also expanded production capacity for Ram pickups in North America, gunning to displace the Chevy Silverado https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-fca-ram-trucks-idCAL2N1X9030 as the No. 2 brand in the North American pickup segment.
That strategy - led by Mike Manley, now head of Stellantis North America - worked. Through the first half of 2021, Ram's pickups have outsold the Silverado and are now in second place behind Ford's F-series trucks, the best-selling model line in the United States for more than 40 years, according to sales data compiled by Automotive News.
SMARTPHONE-LIKE EXPERIENCE
Steve Carlisle, head of GM's North American operations, told Reuters GM has learned from the challenge from Ram. ""You have to be very agile and react,"" he said. ""And maybe ask different types of questions.""
Going forward, Carlisle said GM sees the market moving from ""bigger is better"" when it comes to dashboard displays to more emphasis on improving the user experience.
Carlisle said his goal for the revamped Silverado is to knock Ford out of the top spot in the segment.
""We will not rest until that happens,"" he said, though he added, ""we are going to do the right thing from a brand point of view.""
Ram and Ford have their own upgrades coming for 2022. Ram trucks will get enhanced infotainment systems. Ford is touting a hybrid system available on the F-150 pickup that can power a house, and promoting its all-electric F-150 Lightning coming next spring. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-ford-doubles-lightning-production-target-strong-pre-launch-demand-2021-08-23/#:~:text=DETROIT%2C%20Aug%2023%20(Reuters),several%20people%20and%20suppliers%20familiar
The new Silverados will get other new technology. The redesigned trucks will be the largest-scale application of GM's partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to create a more smartphone-like experience in cars. And top-of-the-line Silverados will offer GM's Super Cruise system as an option to enable hands-free driving on more than 200,000 miles (321,869 km) of roads in Canada and the United States.
The Silverado ZR2 responds to a more traditional form of automotive competition. Powerful pickup trucks equipped with tall, beefy suspensions and other modifications to handle racing over rough desert or leaping sand dunes have become the 21st century answer to Detroit's 1960s muscle cars. Ford and Ram had models designed for extreme off-road enthusiasts. Chevy did not. Now it will.

Carlisle said 60% of Chevrolet Silverados sold now are ""lifted trucks"" with tall suspensions. The Silverado ZR2 will add a 420-horsepower, eight-cylinder gasoline engine to the formula. Carlisle said the ZR2 could account for more than 10% of Silverado sales.
Ford's Raptor has a starting price of nearly $66,000. Carlisle said Chevrolet's ZR2 will be more ""accessible"" with a lower starting price.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is doubling fines for first-time offenders who fail to wear masks, effective Friday, and said repeat offenders could face fines as high as $3,000.
The White House said President Joe Biden was directing the higher fines to ""ensure that masking requirements remain in place on the other modes of transportation as we continue to battle COVID-19.""
TSA said the new fines will ""be $500-$1,000 for first offenders and $1,000-$3,000 for second offenders.""
Biden told reporters at the White House ""TSA will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules be prepared to pay. And by the way, show some respect.""
He criticized the anger shown by some passengers toward flight attendants and others for enforcing mask requirements.
""It's wrong. It's ugly,"" Biden said.
Last month, TSA extended requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses and at airports and train stations through Jan. 18 to address ongoing COVID-19 risks. The regulations had been set to expire Sept. 13.
TSA Administrator David Pekoske said ""by doubling the range of penalties, we seek to reinforce the importance of voluntary adherence.""
TSA said that operators throughout the transportation network have reported over 4,000 face mask-related incidents. To date, almost 4,000 warning notices have been sent and 126 have been referred for civil penalty.
TSA said in January that first-time incidents would start at $250 for failing to wear masks.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued much higher fines for not wearing masks on airplanes and for other disruptive behavior.
The FAA has proposed penalties totaling more than $1 million, including many $9,000 fines for not wearing masks on airplanes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A top U.S. banking regulator fined  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) $250 million and placed new restrictions on the bank's business after finding shortcomings in its earlier efforts to pay back customers it had previously harmed.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the bank had not met the requirements of a 2018 consent order, when the regulator ordered the bank to pay back customers who were charged excessive or improper fees.
""Wells Fargo has not met the requirements of the OCC’s 2018 action against the bank. This is unacceptable,"" said acting Comptroller Michael Hsu in a statement.
Specifically, the OCC said Wells Fargo's efforts to identify and pay back customers who had been previously harmed by the bank were insufficient, citing ""significant deficiencies"" in its earlier attempt.
In 2018, Wells Fargo agreed to a joint $1 billion settlement with regulators, who found the bank had wrongly layered insurance on hundreds of thousands of drivers and routinely assessed excessive and improper fees on homebuyers.
As part of that earlier consent order, the bank had been directed to create a program to identify wronged customers and pay them restitution.
In a statement, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charles Scharf said the new penalty shows more work is needed to address ""significant, longstanding deficiencies.”
""Our work to build the right foundation for a company of our size and complexity will not follow a straight line. We are managing multiple issues concurrently, and progress will come alongside setbacks. That said, we believe we’re making significant progress,"" he added.

The penalty marks the latest hit to the bank, which began addressing widespread customer abuses nearly five years ago.
Last year, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve civil and criminal probes into the firm's fraudulent and high-pressure sales practices. The OCC previously slapped eight former executives with more than $58 million in fines.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, and San Jose, Calif.-based Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) are two prominent players in the semiconductor industry. ASML develops, sells, and services advanced semiconductor equipment systems, focusing on lithography-related systems worldwide. It caters mainly to the makers of memory chips and logic chips. In comparison, AVGO designs and supplies a range of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions used in data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones, and base stations.
The heightened demand for semiconductor chips from various industries, mainly automotive and consumer electronics, amid a global chip supply crunch has driven prices higher. However, the industry recorded 29% year-over-year sales growth in July 2021. And because rising government and corporate investments in the semiconductor industry should gradually address the supply crunch, the industry should witness solid growth. The global semiconductor market is expected to grow at 7.7% CAGR to $778 billion by 2026. So, both ASML and AVGO should benefit.

(Reuters) - Shares in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) carved out a tiny gain on Thursday after dropping as much as 10.5% earlier in the session even as the video game retailer's silence on its turnaround plan led its army of individual investors to question the meteoric rise in its share price this year.
The company posted a 25% jump in quarterly sales, but its executives gave no new details for a plan to refashion itself from a mostly brick-and-mortar retailer. The company recently raised more than $1 billion in fresh equity.
GameStop shares closed up 0.2% at $199.18 after touching a low of $178 during the session. Thursday's close was more than 10 times its close of $18.84 at the end of 2020. But it compared poorly with a $483 peak reached in January, when the stock was seeing wild swings at the height of a battle between small-time traders and Wall Street hedge funds.
Thursday marked the stock's first time finishing in positive territory in the session after an earnings update after declining the last four times. And GameStop had fallen close to 30% after its previous two updates.
""This is the third time that investors have expected GameStop management to articulate its strategy and the third time the company failed to do so,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who rates it ""underperform"" with a $50 price target. 
""We think that GameStop will continue to promise and to fail to deliver a strategy to its investors, and will seek ways to increase online sales while it holds investors at bay.""

GameStop faces competition from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox, which is building its own streaming devices for cloud gaming to reach gamers on any television or monitor without the need for a console.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 05:02PM ET</span>","Russia and Belarus agree closer energy, economic integration","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The leaders of Russia and Belarus on Thursday agreed to set up a unified oil and gas market and to deepen economic integration in the face of what they regard as unjustified Western sanctions on both their economies. 
The agreement, reached after Kremlin talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, is likely to be seen as the latest show of support by Putin for Lukashenko who last year used force to break up huge protests against his rule.
The West has hit Belarus with sanctions to punish the authorities for the crackdown. Russia is under Western sanctions too for its treatment of Ukraine. 
Moscow and Minsk have long been formally part of a ""union state"" and held talks about further integration. That has prompted concerns from the beleaguered Belarusian opposition that Lukashenko will trade off chunks of sovereignty in return for even more backing from the Kremlin against the West.
The two leaders told a news conference that they had agreed to 28 integration road maps that covered common approaches to macro-economic policies, including monetary policy, taxes and custom rules.
They also announced plans to integrate their energy markets. 
Putin said the two countries would sign a document before December 2023 to create a unified gas market and conclude similar agreements for oil and electricity. 
He said Moscow would also leave its prices for natural gas unchanged for Belarus at the current $128.5 per 1,000 cubic metres in 2022.
""And we are not even going to index the price for Belarus in terms of dollar inflation even though it is significant,"" Putin said. 
Russia, which sees the ex-Soviet republic of 9.5 million as a strategically-important buffer to its west, has helped keep Lukashenko in power with loans and political backing.
Such support helped him weather last year's protests which were widely regarded as the biggest challenge to his 27-year rule and were called to try to overturn what the opposition said was his rigged election win. 
Lukashenko denies last year's presidential election was manipulated in his favour. 
Putin said Russia would provide Belarus with around $630-640 million in loans by the end of 2022.
He said the two countries were focusing on economic integration before discussing potential political integration.

The talks happened on the same day that Russia and Belarus formally opened vast joint military drills, a week-long exercise across the territory of both countries and in the Baltic Sea that has alarmed some NATO countries.
Putin said it made sense for Russia and Belarus to hold the drills near their western borders given what he said were moves by NATO to bolster its presence in the wider region.

""Wall Street is still bullish. You're going to have a slow Fed as far as tapering and interest rate hikes. We will see a tremendous amount of accommodation to pump up this economy.""

For the current S&P 500 (SPY) environment, I don’t think that is sufficient. Instead, I believe a better way is to classify stocks into three categories – growth, value, and reflation. Reflation stocks outperform when optimism about economic growth and the economy returning to normal increase. Think of energy, materials, and travel stocks. Value stocks are comprised of industries like utilities, defense, and consumer staples that deliver steady returns and perform best when interest rates and growth expectations decline. They are the best bet in an environment of low-growth and low rates. In recent months, growth stocks have underperformed after leading in 2020. For the sake of clarity, I define them as stocks with exposure to industries that are expected to rapidly expand in the coming years (independent of the broader economy) and tend to have high multiples and are riskier in the event of a market sell-off or poor earnings results. In this week’s commentary, I want to discuss why the environment is improving for this group and the reflation stocks, plus how we will take advantage. Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published September 08, 2021 from the POWR Growth newsletter).

Since last week, we’ve seen an attempt at new highs which was quickly rejected. However, the selling has been pretty light in terms of volume, and we are less than 1% from all-time highs.

Hence, quality steel stocks  Nucor  (NUE), Ternium (TX), Reliance Steel & Aluminum (RS), and Commercial Metals (CMC) should witness plenty of upsides in the upcoming months.The steel industry has witnessed a solid recovery due to rising demand from increasing industrial activity and construction projects over the past few months. This, combined with the world’s largest steel producer China’s curb on output to reduce carbon emissions, is driving steel prices higher. China’s production cuts will likely continue in the second half, creating a big supply crunch and keeping the market red hot.
On the other hand, the Senate’s passage of the $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill, which allotted $550 billion to improve and develop America's infrastructure over the next five years, should add to steel demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Technological glitches will cause the U.S. Justice Department to be late in paying out around $3 billion in grants that fund programs such as victims services and criminal justice research, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.
The problems with the grant management system known as JustGrants https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-47-billion-grant-programs-tech-woes-take-toll-justice-groups-2021-07-12 are delaying more than half of the criminal justice grants to municipalities, states, research institutions and nonprofits that the department would normally award by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
The documents reveal ongoing woes in the administration of its $4.7 billion grant program first reported by Reuters in July that led the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley, to call for a probe https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-us-senator-demands-inquiry-into-justice-dept-grants-system-2021-07-21 of the program. The Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, later said his office would audit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-watchdog-launches-audit-into-troubled-grants-system-2021-08-04 the $115 million contract with General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) to build JustGrants.
The Justice Department said in internal planning records that it will be forced to give out the money on a rolling basis, and will only aim to award about $1.4 billion by Sept. 30. The bulk of that money entails grants designated to help victims of crime.
Another roughly $560 million will be awarded by Oct. 31 and the rest of the funds, more than $2.5 billion, are targeted to be awarded by Dec. 31, according to the draft documents.
The internal planning documents are still in the draft stage, and the total amounts could still change.
""We deeply regret that there may be delays and understand how important it is to get all grant awards processed as quickly as possible,"" wrote Amy Solomon, the acting assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice Programs, in a notice sent to staff after Reuters reported on the delays.
""I know that you are all doing everything you can to ensure that grantees receive awards as quickly as possible so that we can get these critical resources to the field and our stakeholders can continue the essential work of protecting communities, serving victims, and supporting a justice system that is just, fair, and effective.""
The Justice Department is expected to formally notify lawmakers and grantees about the delays in funding in the near future.
A Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment.
The JustGrants system has been plagued with glitches since its October 2020 launch, making it hard for grantees to file applications or upload crucial financial reports required in order to get their funding.
Reuters in July reported that some grant recipients had faced monthslong delays accessing their awards due to problems with JustGrants, prompting multiple complaints to Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general. 
When the inspector general announced the audit of the General Dynamics contract, a spokesman for the company said it was working with the department ""to deliver a modernized JustGrants system"" and the work was being completed ""in line with the implementation roadmap and schedule"" laid out by the Justice Department.

The Justice Department awards some $4.7 billion in grants each year to help fund everything from body-worn cameras for police to transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking victims.
Critics say the problems with JustGrants could hinder President Joe Biden's efforts to persuade Congress to appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding for additional Justice Department grant programs, including $300 million to help law enforcement hire more police officers.

Investing.com -- Stocks dropped back a bit on Thursday after weekly jobless claims fell to a near 18-month low, easing fears of a delay in the economic recovery but flaming worries about the end of stimulus. 
The Labor Department’s weekly data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped to 310,000 for the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when the pandemic began.
The Federal Reserve meets later this month for its next policy debate, though many believe it won’t announce a beginning of tapering off its bond purchases until later this year. 
Tepid data on hiring in August, plus evidence of a pull back in travel and dining out after a surge in coronavirus cases this summer are competing with news about rising prices.
In individual stocks, vaccine makers got a boost on Thursday ahead of President Joe Biden’s expected announcement that federal workers and contractors who work with the federal government would need to be vaccinated.
Biden is urging more employers across the country to institute vaccine requirements for employees, as well, and encouraging testing protocols. Many companies, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), have further postponed the date when employees would be brought back into their offices to work.
Friday should be a quiet day for the markets, as Wall Street and the U.S. pause to reflect on the passage of 20 years since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Grocery chain earnings
Grocery chain giant Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) is expected to report earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $30.63 billion in the second quarter. Analysts will be listening to the company’s comments about hiring and labor conditions as well as rising food prices and logistical challenges.
2. Producer prices
U.S. producer or wholesale prices, a measure of inflation before goods and services reach the end-consumer, are likely to have cooled in August, expected to rise by 0.6% after the 1% jump in July. Before this, the index had risen in back-to-back months.
The so-called core inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is expected to show a gain of 0.5% in August after it also rose 1% in the prior month. Both reports are out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Inventories at wholesalers
The U.S. Census Bureau will Friday release its data total inventories at merchant wholesalers. They had risen 0.6% to $636.3 billion in July. That report comes out at 10:00 AM ET.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>","U.S. FDA says it needs more time to decide on Juul, other e-cigarettes","By Chris Kirkham and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it needs more time to decide whether e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc and other major manufacturers can sell their products in the United States.
The agency had been expected to make a decision by Thursday, a year after Juul and other e-cigarette brands, including British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc's Vuse and Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) Plc's Blu, faced a deadline to file applications showing their products provided a net benefit to public health.
A federal judge set a September 2020 deadline for the e-cigarette makers and gave companies a one-year grace period to remain on the market without FDA enforcement, while the agency reviewed applications.
The agency on Thursday said it continues to ""work expeditiously on the remaining applications,"" adding many are ""in the final stages of review.""
It said products that have not been authorized by the FDA - a category that now includes Juul after the one-year grace period - ""are subject to enforcement action at the FDA's discretion.""
The agency said it will work ""as quickly as possible to provide regulatory certainty"" and is prioritizing enforcement of e-cigarette products that have not applied for FDA authorization. 
The FDA's scientific review of e-cigarettes will decide whether they are effective in getting smokers to quit and, if so, whether the benefits to smokers outweigh the health damage to new users - including teenagers - who never smoked.
REGULATORY GRAY AREA
E-cigarettes have operated in a regulatory gray area for years. The products, which vaporize a nicotine-laced liquid, have been available in the United States since at least 2007, but the FDA did not formally get jurisdiction over the industry until May 2016.
During that time, Juul and dozens of competitors introduced products that were grandfathered into the market because they were already being sold before the regulation took effect.
The 2016 rule required e-cigarette makers to file extensive applications to the FDA by August 2018 demonstrating the public health benefits of their products, along with data on potential toxins.
Under the administration of Donald Trump, the FDA pushed back the application date to 2022, but public health groups sued in federal court and succeeded in getting the deadline moved up to last year.
In June, FDA acting Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock told a congressional panel the agency had received applications for 6.5 million products from more than 550 companies, and said reviewing all submissions by Sept. 9 ""will be challenging.""
In August, the agency denied marketing applications for nearly 55,000 flavored e-cigarette products from three small companies for failing to provide evidence they appropriately protect public health. The FDA has so far denied applications from more than 100 companies, but has not made a decision on Juul or other major tobacco industry players.
Teenage use of e-cigarettes has surged in recent years, a trend that largely coincided with the rise in popularity of Juul in 2017 and 2018. E-cigarette use among high school students grew from 11.7% in 2017 to 27.5% in 2019, before declining to 19.6% last year, according to a federal survey.
A Reuters investigation in 2019 detailed how Juul’s developers used tobacco industry research and patents to formulate a smooth but potent blend of liquid nicotine that became a key factor in its popularity among teenagers. (https://reut.rs/3hgWDmI)
Facing a backlash from parents, teachers and regulators, including state attorneys general, Juul stopped selling its popular fruit- and mint-flavored nicotine pods in 2019, ahead of an FDA ban on such flavors in early 2020.

Over the last two years, Juul has tried to repair its relationship with regulators and the public by taking a lower profile. It stopped print, TV and online advertising in 2019, and pulled back on its international expansion plans to focus on winning regulatory approval in the United States.
Federal survey data from last year showed that Juul’s popularity among teenagers declined significantly from 2019, but was offset by increases in teenage use of other brands. Juul was still the most popular brand among teenagers, according to the survey.

""The end of quarter delivery wave is unusually high this time, as we suffered (like the whole industry) from extremely severe parts shortages earlier this quarter,"" he said in the email sent on Wednesday.
He said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) built ""a lot of cars with missing parts that needed to be added later."" 
""This is the biggest wave in Tesla history,"" he said, referring to its end of quarter delivery push. 
Tesla posted record quarterly vehicle deliveries for the April-June quarter, but Musk said in July that its output growth for the rest of this year would be determined by the global chip shortage situation, which ""remained quite serious."" 
Musk has traditionally sent out emails to employees near the end of almost every quarter urging employees to boost deliveries, and sometimes hinting at its delivery targets. 
LFP BATTERY 
Tesla has recently started U.S. sales of a Model 3 version with different, lithium iron phosphate batteries, which it said will help bring forward vehicle deliveries. 
The LFP battery is currently used in Tesla's China-made Model 3 and Model Ys that are sold there and exported to Europe and other countries. 

Tesla said customers who switch to Model 3 with an LFP battery would be able to receive the model sooner than the original delivery date of year-end. 
""Due to limited supply and strong customer demand, we are introducing the Model 3 Standard Range Plus battery pack, which we already released in Europe and Asia, to North America,"" it said in an email to some customers and seen by Reuters.

N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - Unable to honour debt commitments, authorities in Chad are hoping for a ""favourable opinion"" from Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) Plc on restructuring the country's commercial debt under the G20 framework, said Prime Minister Albert Pahimi Padacke.
Chad officially requested a restructuring of its public debt back in January, the first country to do so under a new framework agreed by Group of 20 (G20) major economies last year. The central African nation's commercial external debt is concentrated in an oil-backed loan from the Swiss commodities trader. 
""Glencore represents for Chad today more than 98% of the country's commercial debt,"" Padacke said during a news conference. ""We need to renegotiate things because we have a serious cash flow problem."" 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it was crucial for Chad to come to comparable terms with its private creditors as it did with public creditors in June. Glencore is Chad's largest private creditor.
Meanwhile a source familiar with the restructuring efforts said Glencore and a handful of Chad's other commercial creditors had formed a committee to represent investors in the negotiations.
""The IMF is very keen to get things moving,"" the source said, adding the committee held a ""substantial portion"" of the debt.
G20 and Paris Club creditors - including China, France, India and Saudi Arabia - backed Chad's common framework request in mid-April though the process ground temporarily to a halt after then President Idriss Deby was killed in battle just days later.
Under the G20 framework, official creditors are meant to agree among themselves on the depth of any concessions on their debt. The terms are then translated into a proposal for private creditors. Both Zambia and Ethiopia have also requested debt overhauls under the G20 plan.
Prime Minister Padacke said authorities have met with Glencore four times to discuss a restructuring deal that would fall within the G20 framework and are awaiting the company's decision.

""We are hopeful that the company will agree because all partners are waiting for Glencore's decision,"" Padacke said. ""When you are in debt, the creditor always has the last word.""
A Glencore spokesperson declined to comment.

A spokesman for Buttigieg declined to comment. A spokesman for Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Republicans, led by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the United States ""must not surrender to China and its efforts to dominate our high-tech sectors, including (autonomous vehicles).""
The letter asked Buttigieg if he believes ""Huawei intends to do with the automotive sector what it did to the communications equipment sector?""
Huawei told Reuters in August it was ""positioning ourselves as a new component provider for intelligent connected vehicles"" and to help automakers ""build better vehicles.""
In August, the Biden administration told Reuters it had not changed the policy on restricting sales of goods and technology to Huawei put in place during the Trump presidency.

Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019, after the Trump administration said it was operating contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.
The so-called ""entity list"" restricts suppliers from selling U.S. goods and technology to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.

GDL ended its third and longest strike in this pay round on Tuesday and its action has paralysed large parts of passenger traffic over the summer holiday season and hit freight services in Europe's biggest economy.
""If a negotiable offer has not been made by the beginning of next week, the GDL will start to prepare the next strike,"" said GDL boss Claus Weselsky, adding Deutsche Bahn appeared to be playing for time.
A spokesperson for Deutsche Bahn, which made the drivers an improved offer just before the last strike, said the company was doing everything possible to resolve the dispute quickly. 

""We are looking intensively at where we can move closer (to the union) so we can finally resolve this. The aim is to talk to the GDL again soon,"" said the spokesperson.

However, Taylor Dart explains why investors should consider getting more aggressive here.It’s been a disappointing year thus far for silver (SLV) and the Silver Miners Index (SIL), with the metal sliding by more than 8% year-to-date and the Silver Miners Index plunging more than 13%. While the underperformance and consolidation are not surprising after a 47% return for silver, the volatility has likely unnerved many investors and forced some to go looking for greener pastures. Fortunately, when it comes to the bigger picture, we haven’t seen any real technical damage, and the Silver/Gold ratio continues to remain in a long-term uptrend, though, this is contingent on silver holding the $21.50/oz level. So, while it’s easy to throw in the towel and I would not rule out a re-test of the recent low at $22.50/oz, I remain bullish on the price of silver long-term, especially given the recent capitulation in bullish sentiment.
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
As shown in the chart above, bullish sentiment for silver has fallen off a cliff in the past six months, descending from single day readings of more than 90% bulls in late February to a reading of barely 10% bulls on Wednesday. This exodus from the bull camp is a great contrarian indicator, with silver typically finding strong buying support on further weakness when readings dip to these depressed levels. As the chart above shows, this plunge in short-term sentiment has pushed the long-term sentiment moving average for silver to its lowest levels in years, with a current reading of 24%. This is the worst reading since September 2018, which ended up marking a bottom for silver. While silver did fall another 4% after hitting a reading of sub 25% bulls on its long-term moving average, the metal was 9% higher over the next six months and 24% higher just 12 months later. This represented an attractive forward 12-month return drawdown to forward 12-month return of 6 to 1.

Investing.com – Ford Motor stock (NYSE:F) fell 2% Thursday on its decision to stop making cars in India, one of the largest and toughest markets in the world.
The decision will affect 4,000 employees, the company said. Many more are going to be affected as dealers shut showrooms and vendors are forced to look for other buyers of their products.
The decision comes after the company accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion over the past 10 years and a $800 million non-operating write-down of assets in 2019.
The company, like its rival General Motors (NYSE:GM), couldn’t crack the Indian market where hatchbacks and fuel-efficient affordable cars made by Japanese and South Korean companies have so far ruled the roost. The market is slowly moving toward SUVs where the Koreans and Chinese dominate along with a couple of local companies.
Ford will continue to provide customers in India with ongoing parts, service, and warranty support. As part of the plan, Ford India will wind down vehicle assembly at Sanand in the western state of Gujarat by the fourth quarter of 2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing at Chennai in Tamil Nadu by the second quarter of 2022.
It will now serve new customers with imported vehicles. It said it will continue to make engines for exports while keeping thousands at its R&D and engineering unit in Chennai employed.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Akanksha Rana
BOSTON (Reuters) -GameStop Corp, at the center of this year's ""meme stock"" trading frenzy, on Wednesday reported a 25% jump in quarterly sales but failed to lay out fresh details about how it plans to refashion itself into a gaming and entertainment retailer.
Fresh from raising new capital and watching its share price march higher during the second quarter, GameStop (NYSE:GME) executives reported that net sales, the company's main performance metric, jumped to $1.18 billion in the three months ended July 31 from $942 million a year earlier as vaccinations encouraged people to return to its stores.
Analysts had estimated sales of $1.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Despite the stronger numbers, investors reacted by pushing the shares down 7.7% in after-hours trading, complaining on the internet that the company was still not taking questions and was declining to tip its hand about future plans.
Wednesday marked the first time that GameStop's new chief executive, Matt Furlong, spoke to investors. Furlong, who joined in June, promised that the company's mission was still to ""delight customers"" and deliver value to long-term shareholders.
While the company has excited many retail investors with the prospects of building the leader in the video game business, which has higher revenue than the Hollywood movie industry, Furlong's post-results conference call lasted less than 10 minutes and did not allow for questions.
He also provided no financial forecasts.
Early this year, retail investors hyped stocks including GameStop on news site Reddit and brokerage site Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), a blow to several established hedge funds that bet the stocks would tumble and creating such a frenzy of fortunes made and lost that the U.S. Congress held hearings to investigate https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/hedge-funds-robinhood-face-grilling-by-congress-over-gamestop-reddit-rally-2021-02-18. 
SHORT CALL, SHORT ON DETAILS
The quarterly results come as investors closely track chairman and top shareholder Ryan Cohen's efforts to reinvent the company by focusing more on e-commerce while also trying to rejuvenate the physical stores after a year of pandemic-related closures.
Whether Cohen, along with his new management team, will succeed is still unclear and there were no new hints on Wednesday only weeks after Cohen said in June, ""You won’t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition.""
The company's shares fell nearly $15 or 7.4% in after-hours trading after closing the regular session at $198.80, marking a 955% increase so far this year.
Over half of the approximately $110 million worth of GameStop shares traded after hours on Wednesday came after the company's conference call. Some commenters on Reddit's wallstreetbets trading forum complained that the call was short and lacked specifics about GameStop's turnaround strategy.
GameStop reported a net loss of $61.6 million compared with a loss of $111.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The company also reported $378.9 million in expenses, up from $348.2 in the year ago quarter. ""Revenues were just slightly higher than expected and operating expenses were meaningfully higher, so losses were wider than we expected,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote.
At the annual meeting in June, Cohen emphasized the company's focus on ""long-term growth"" as it takes on both big-box retailers and works to revive its own network of stores.
Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc, has hired several Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) veterans and raised funds for his turnaround efforts through a share sale while focusing on improving the stores' business by adding higher-margin products and better inventory.
This is GameStop's second straight quarterly revenue beat after having missed estimates for more than two years as the company struggled with gamers shunning physical discs to download and play online, a trend that accelerated during the pandemic.

Adjusted loss per share was 76 cents, compared with a loss of $1.42 a year ago but analysts had expected a 67-cent loss, according to Refinitiv IBES data based on the work of four analysts.
The company ended the quarter with $1.78 billion in cash and with no long-term debt other than a $47.5 million low-interest loan associated with the French government's pandemic response.

Beer took over the reins from Marianne Lake, who is currently co-head of the consumer and community banking division with Jennifer Piepszak, also a former CEO of the cards business at Chase. 
Beer joined the bank in 2017 to lead partnerships with payments companies in the bank's digital division. Her team managed partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, Samsung (KS:005930) Pay and Android Pay, among others. 
She was formerly with  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), where she held key roles across mergers and acquisitions, card benefits and digital partnerships. 
The bank named Rohan Amin as the chief product officer of Chase, a role that was held by Beer before her appointment as CEO of cards. Amin joined JPMorgan Chase from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) in 2014, where he ran the global cybersecurity solutions division. 

JPMorgan also appointed Gill Haus to the role of chief information officer at Chase. Haus, who joined the bank right before the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in February 2020 from Capital One, was hired to lead digital technology for the consumer bank. 
Chase is JPMorgan's retail bank which is housed within its consumer & community banking division.

Investing.com – Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock traded 0.4% lower Thursday as a report in The Wall Street Journal said the retailer is phasing out its decades-old quarterly bonuses for store workers and merging them with the base pay.
The company is currently implementing wage hike for its staff, having raised the minimum pay $1 to $12 per hour.. According to the WSJ report, most workers preferred the new formula given the hourly wage is the most important part of their pay, and that merging the two increases the amount of a consistent, predictable income.
It is not clear how the merging of the bonus will pan out cost-wise for the company but it would generally be expected to inflate the expenses given the payout is no longer conditional on the store or the worker meeting certain targets.  
Earlier, given the bonus depended on a store’s performance, it varied since the outlet didn’t always qualify for the worker to earn the money.
The move comes at a time when employers, from retailers to restaurants to manufacturers have found it difficult to attract workers. Most companies have been forced to hike wages to address the gap.
Walmart moved to a quarterly bonus payout in 2007 from what used to be an annual feature, started decades ago by its founder. Base pay at the country’s largest employer lags Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Target  's (NYSE:TGT) where it is $15 an hour.  
By the end of this month, company workers will earn an average of $16.40 per hour, the WSJ report said quoting the company."

The companies have delivered stellar performances over the past few months and their stocks are on track to continue moving higher in price. Read on.Stocks with a market capitalization of $50 million - $300 million are typically characterized as micro-cap stocks. These stocks are usually riskier investments due to their low liquidity and the issuing companies’ obscurity. While low liquidity often results in substantial price fluctuations, these companies' small stature often obscures their stocks from retail investors and Wall Street analysts.
In addition, because the stock market has been rallying relentlessly over the past few months, most large-cap and mid-cap stocks have become highly overvalued. But many micro-cap stocks still have plenty of upside to deliver due in part to their issuers’ easy access to capital thanks to the continued low-interest-rate environment.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 12:13PM ET</span>","European stocks pare losses after ECB slows stimulus, as expected","By Sruthi Shankar and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - Euro zone stocks bounced off session lows to end little changed on Thursday after the European Central Bank signalled it will only slightly reduce its emergency bond purchases over the coming quarter, as widely expected.
After falling as much as 0.9% in morning trade, the pan-European STOXX 600 index ended largely unchanged around 467.57 points. The index had shed 1.5% over the past two days on fears of a more-hawkish-than-expected ECB. 
Rate-sensitive banking stocks in the bloc rose 0.2%, while real estate stocks led gains with a 1.0% rise. 
The ECB, while taking a token step towards unwinding the emergency aid, gave no signal of its next policy move, including how it might dismantle the 1.85-trillion-euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), which has kept borrowing costs low for governments and businesses.
""Today’s meeting confirms our earlier expectations that PEPP will end after March. That said, the ECB clearly remains data-dependent, and has kept all options open for December,"" Rabobank analysts wrote in a note.
""That desire to remain flexible is also underscored by the avoidance of the word ‘tapering’, and the message that today did not mark a turning point for PEPP."" 
Analysts now expect the ECB to outline plans for major policy changes by December, and a gradual phasing out of the PEPP by March 2022. 
UK's FTSE 100 led losses among regional indexes with a 1.0% drop. (L)
British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) tumbled 10.2% and was the worst performer on the STOXX 600 after it rejected a takeover approach from Wizz Air, opting instead to raise $1.7 billion from shareholders and go it alone in an industry battling to recover from the pandemic.
Rival British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) fell 1.1%, while Wizz Air dropped 1.2%, weighing on the wider travel & leisure index. 
After hitting record highs in mid-August, the STOXX 600 has traded below those levels amid investor worries over the fast-spreading Delta coronavirus variant, a slowing economic recovery, and the withdrawal of stimulus by major central banks.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 11:52AM ET</span>",Chinese regulatory squeeze weighs on gaming shares worldwide,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese gaming and related shares skidded on Thursday, dragged down by an ongoing regulatory squeeze that has engulfed industries ranging from online platforms and entertainment to for-profit tutoring and real estate.
In the latest blow to China's online gaming sector, the South China Morning Post reported on Thursday afternoon that Beijing had temporarily suspended approvals of new games, further hitting shares in Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES).
The publication later corrected its story to say China had temporarily slowed down, rather than suspended, approval for new online games. 
Shares in the two companies closed more than 8% and 11% lower respectively.
U.S. gaming stocks also were lower, with Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) down about 3% and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software off roughly 1% each.
In Europe, France's Ubisoft fell as much as 2.6% while Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which holds nearly 29% of Tencent, fell about 5% in Amsterdam trading. 
The SCMP said the strategy to slow down approvals emerged after a Wednesday meeting between Chinese authorities and gaming firms including Tencent Holdings and NetEase, said the report citing unnamed sources briefed on the matter.
The newspaper had initially said the decision to freeze video game approvals was revealed at the meeting. 
Tencent declined to comment on gaming approvals while the National Press and Publication Administration, which is responsible for approving game titles, and NetEase did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Stocks in listed gaming companies had already been battered earlier in the day after state news agency Xinhua reported on the same meeting. 
Xinhua said the meeting aimed to ensure the companies implemented strict new rules to curb gaming addiction among minors, including a ban last month on under-18s playing video games for more than three hours a week. Its report did not mention the subject of gaming approvals.
Xinhua also said that companies were told to ""resolutely curb incorrect tendencies such as focusing 'only on money' and 'only on traffic', and change rules and gameplay designs that induce players to indulge"".
Both Tencent and NetEase said earlier in the day they would comply with the regulators' requests.
""The Chinese government is taking a very serious approach to online gaming and these reported restrictions are a step ahead on that program,"" said Kingston Securities executive director Dickie Wong. 
""I think these moves show for investors it is not a good idea to put their money in just one of the internet or technology companies on the mainland.”
Qi Wang, CEO of MegaTrust Investment (HK), said the regulatory pressure will likely last for years not months. ""It’s still to early to tell which companies are better positioned to deal with the on-going regulatory scrutiny.""
For U.S. gaming companies Activision, Take-Two and EA, China represents less than 10% of revenue, said Eric Handler, media and entertainment analyst at MKM Partners.
“That being said, China being the largest market for video games is an important market and one companies are trying to expand into,” Handler said. “All of these companies do have games in the pipeline they would like to get approved, so this is a further slowdown in that process.”
'METAVERSE' WARNING
Global and domestic investors have been jolted by an ongoing regulatory squeeze that has sought to root out some of the perceived excesses of the runaway growth in some of China's new economy sectors in recent years. 
Separately on Thursday, Chinese state media cautioned investors against blindly buying Chinese stocks hoping to profit from the so-called ""metaverse,"" a shared space based on virtual technologies. 
The commentary by the official Securities Times follows a recent surge in stocks such as Shenzhen Zhongqingbao Interaction Network and Perfect World that are perceived as developing the metaverse.
Shares in related stocks tumbled after the commentary was published, with Wondershare Technology falling by nearly 11% and Goertek down by almost 9%.

Other regulatory measures have included a crackdown on anticompetitive behaviour among online ""platform"" companies and seeking greater control of the vast stores of data generated by the industry.
The transport ministry also said on Wednesday it would intensify a crackdown on illegal behaviour in the ride-hailing industry and deal with online platforms that are still using non-compliant vehicles and drivers.

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) fell 4.2% on Thursday on a report in India’s Economic Times newspaper that the launch of the company’s Covid-19 vaccine in the country may take more time.
According to the report, in the absence of its approval in the U.S., India’s drug regulator has asked for the immunogenicity data from Serum Institute of India. The Indian company is the manufacturer and distributor of Novavax’s Covid vaccine.
While the trials are ongoing, data is likely to be submitted only by next month, the ET report said.
Novavax has filed for emergency use authorization of the vaccine in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Filing for EUA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administrator is only expected to happen in December quarter. The company is significantly behind the likes of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and others in rolling out its Covid vaccine. That has reflected in its share price which is down around 30% from its 52-week high of $331.
India would have been a key market for the company given its population and the opportunity it had due to its tie-up with SII, the country’s largest vaccine-maker. SII also makes and distributes AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) Covid vaccine, accounting for more than 90% of the shots administered so far in the world’s second-most affected country due to the pandemic.
That window for Novavax may be narrowing for now as the country is now vaccinating more than 10 million people a day after a slow start. More than half have now been vaccinated with at least one dose in the 1.3-billion-people nation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Old Republic National Title Insurance Co, one of the largest U.S. title insurers, will stop using ""no-poach"" agreements that prevent workers from moving to rivals, under a settlement on Thursday with New York's attorney general.
The unit of  Old Republic International  (NYSE:ORI) Corp will also pay $1 million under the settlement, resolving an antitrust probe by the office of the attorney general, Letitia James.
Old Republic, based in Chicago, issues policies through agencies it owns or controls, or through independent agencies it appoints.
James said the probe found that Old Republic entered written and verbal no-poach agreements with the independent agencies, including some agreements intended to last after their business relationships ended.
Critics say no-poach agreements drag down wages and impede career growth. James said Old Republic's agreements effectively ended competition to hire top-performing workers.
""For years, Old Republic stifled competition in the labor market, but this agreement ends the company's illegal conduct,"" James said in a statement.

Old Republic did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but will cooperate in James' probe into no-poach agreements in title insurance.
In 2018 and 2019, several fast food chains including Arby's, Dunkin', Five Guys, Jimmy John's, Little Caesar's and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) agreed to remove no-poach provisions from franchise agreements to end probes by various U.S. states, including New York.

The S&P 500 has climbed 20%, registering seven straight months of gains and more than 50 highs along the way.
Though investors are concerned about the economic impact of the COVID-19 Delta variant, if vaccines remain effective in minimizing severe cases that lead to hospitalizations and deaths, the adverse effects of the current COVID-19 surge are expected to be limited. According to The Conference Board’s Economic Forecast, the economy is expected to witness a steady rebound in the second half of the year on the back of improving consumer spending, a boost in inventories as the holiday period approaches, and continued government support. Furthermore, UBS boosted its year-end S&P 500 forecast to 4650, backed by solid growth activity, solid earnings momentum, and higher fiscal spending.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 11:01AM ET</span>",Ford to stop making cars in India,"By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co will stop making cars in India and take a hit of about $2 billion because it does not see a path to profitability in the country, becoming the latest automaker to leave the major growth market dominated by Asian rivals.
The U.S. carmaker entered India 25 years ago but still has less than 2% of the passenger vehicle market having struggled for years to win over Indian consumers and turn a profit.
Ford said in a statement on Thursday that it had accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion in 10 years in India and demand for its new vehicles had been weak.
""Despite (our) efforts, we have not been able to find a sustainable path forward to long-term profitability,"" Ford India head Anurag Mehrotra said in the statement.
Ford's decision to cut its losses in India after leaving Brazil https://reut.rs/38Q4dQI earlier this year underscores the pressures on global automakers to invest more in electric and automated vehicles, as well as connected vehicle technology. 
Global automakers once fought to maintain a presence in every major market, and were willing to lose money to do so.
Now, companies such as Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM), Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) and Stellantis NV are walking away from money-losing ventures and redirecting capital to electrification and investment in technology they need to survive. 
Ford's decision also comes as a setback for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" campaign. It follows other U.S. vehicle makers such as General Motors and Harley Davidson that have left India in recent years. 
Mehrotra said Ford's decision was also reinforced by ""persistent industry over capacity and lack of expected growth in India's car market"".
India was expected to become the world's third-largest car market by 2020 after China and the United States with sales of some 5 million vehicles a year. Instead, sales have languished at about 3 million, still trailing Europe and Japan too.
India's car market is dominated by low-cost, mainly small cars made by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. Its Maruti Suzuki brand accounts for seven of the top 10 sellers with South Korea's Hyundai Motor making the other three.
WINDING DOWN
Ford has been escalating investment in electric vehicles (EVs) and advanced software. In May, it said it would boost spending on EVs by a third to $30 billion by 2030. 
With so much on Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley's plate since he took charge last year and limited financial resources, India was a lower priority, a source previously told Reuters https://reut.rs/3tszKS6.
As part of the plan, Ford India will wind down operations at its factory in Sanand in the western state of Gujarat by the fourth quarter of 2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing in its southern Indian plant in Chennai by 2022.
Ford has the capacity to produce about 440,000 cars in India a year across both plants but is only using about 25% of that, according to data intelligence company Global Data.
The U.S. automaker will continue to sell some of its cars in India through imports and it will also provide support to dealers to service existing customers, it said. About 4,000 employees are expected to be affected by its decision. 
The decision to stop production came after Ford and India's Mahindra & Mahindra failed to finalise https://reut.rs/3tq3jnD a joint venture partnership that would have allowed Ford to continue making cars at a lower cost than now but cease its independent operations https://reut.rs/3zWIvX6. 
Ford said it had considered several other options for India including partnerships, platform sharing, contract manufacturing and the possibility of selling its manufacturing plants, a plan that is still under review.
Ford will continue to operate its engine factory in Sanand which exports engines for its Ranger pick-up trucks globally. It will also continue to rely on India-based suppliers for parts for its global products.
India's Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations said in a statement that it was shocked by Ford's move, saying the U.S company's decision only to compensate dealers who offer vehicle services to customers as well was ""not enough"".
There are 400 Ford outlets in India where dealers over time have invested 20 billion rupees ($272 million), the association said in a statement, adding that the automaker had been appointing new dealers until as recently as five months ago.

""Such dealers will be at the biggest financial loss in their entire life,"" it said.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>","As 'buy now, pay later' surges, a third of U.S. users fall behind on payments","By Anna Irrera
(Reuters) - A third of U.S. consumers who used ""buy now, pay later"" services have fallen behind on one or more payments, and 72% of those said their credit score declined, a new study published by personal finance company Credit Karma showed.
The study, conducted by software firm Qualtrics, surveyed 1,044 adult consumers in the United States last month to measure their interest in buy now pay later (BNPL) and found 44% had used these services before. 
The usage figure was slightly up from a similar survey conducted by Credit Karma for Reuters in December, while missed payments was down from 38%.
The latest survey found younger consumers were more likely to miss payments. More than half of Gen Z or millennial respondents-- those born between the early 1980s and mid-to-late 1990s-- said they had missed at least one payment. That compares with 22% of Gen X, who were born in the early 1960s to early 1980s, and 10% of Baby Boomers, those born between the mid-1940s and 1980.
There has been a surge in usage of BNPL services, which allow consumers to easily split payments for purchases into installments. The boom in volumes by providers such as Klarna, Affirm Holdings, AfterPay Ltd and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), has been driven in part by online shopping growth during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The explosive growth has led to more dealmaking and competition. Earlier this week PayPal announced it would acquire Japanese buy now, pay later firm Paidy, while last month rival  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) agreed to acquire AfterPay.
The growth has also led to more scrutiny from regulators who aim to ensure consumers do not take on more debt than they can handle.

""It's easier than ever to purchase an item -- and finance it -- without even thinking about the implications of the purchase,"" said Colleen McCreary, financial advocate at Credit Karma. ""It's this disconnect between making a purchase and actually paying for it where consumers can get in trouble."" 
Most consumers who used BNPL services said the purchase was for $500 or less, on average. Low-cost purchases were most common among Gen Z, nearly half of which have used BNPL services to pay for expenses of $100 or less, the survey found.

 Moderna  stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) surged over 6% while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Pfizer  's (NYSE:PFE) partner in developing and marketing of their vaccine, gained more than 4%. Pfizer, a much bigger company than the other two with relatively less reliance on Covid vaccine sales, traded slightly lower. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the only manufacturer in the U.S. with a single-dose vaccine, was down 0.7%.
The decision, if it comes, will be due to the surging Covid cases in the country. The world’s largest economy is averaging more than 150,000 new cases daily.
While Delta, the most rapidly-spreading variant of the original coronavirus, is now weakening in some states, several parts of mid-Atlantic and Mountain West continue to experience outbreaks. About 1,500 deaths are being reported every day.
The executive order, likely to be announced today, may also extend to contractors that work with the U.S. government. In doing so, the earlier requirement of testing will lose its relevance.
Moderna shares were also boosted by its Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel’s comments that the company is developing a single-dose vaccine that combines booster doses against Covid-19 and flu.
""Our number one priority as a company right now is to bring to market a Pan-respiratory annual booster vaccine, which we plan to always customize and upgrade,"" Bancel said during Moderna's R&D day for investors, according to Reuters.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>","Australian media outlets liable for Facebook comments, court finds","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's biggest news publishers including Rupert Murdoch's the Australian are responsible for comments that readers post on their corporate Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages, the High Court ruled on Wednesday.
The court dismissed an appeal against a previous ruling that found in favour of a defamation suit by Dylan Voller, a young man who had been the subject of several news reports about youth detention.
""This is a common-sense decision that accords with longstanding law on the issue of publication,"" Voller’s lawyers, O’Brien Criminal and Civil Solicitors, said in a statement after the ruling.
Voller had said that after stories referring to him were posted on the news companies' Facebook pages, a number of third-party Facebook users made defamatory comments and he alleged that the news outlets were liable as the publishers. 
Voller filed a suit against the publishers, including Fairfax Media, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, which is owned by broadcaster Nine, and others.
After a court found in favour of Voller, the media outlets lodged an appeal based on the argument that they administered a Facebook page on which third parties published their own material.
But the High Court dismissed the appeal and ordered the organisations to pay costs. 
""The acts of the (media companies) in facilitating, encouraging and thereby assisting the posting of comments by the third-party Facebook users rendered them publishers of those comments,"" Justice Rothman found. 
At the time the comments were published, Facebook did not allow page moderators to turn off comments on posts, however it has changed that. 
The case will now return to the New South Wales Supreme Court to determine if any of the comments defamed Voller.
A spokesperson for Nine said it was ""disappointed with the outcome ... as it will have ramifications for what we can post on social media in the future"".

Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) Australia told the Sydney Morning Herald the court decision was significant for anyone who maintains a public social media page.
""They can be liable for comments posted by others on that page even when they are unaware of those comments,"" he said.

However, considering the increasing market volatility, it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound mid-cap stocks AutoNation (NYSE:AN), OneMain (OMF), Penske Automotive (PAG), and Piper Sandler (PIPR). They each have an A (Strong Buy) rating in our POWR Ratings system. Read on.The U.S. returned to its pre-pandemic economic level in the second quarter, as GDP increased by 6.5%. In fact, with a strong vaccination drive, favorable government policies, and strong corporate earnings, the U.S. economy is now bigger than its pre-pandemic level.
Given this backdrop and a low-interest-rate environment, we think it could be wise to bet on mid-cap stocks. That’s because mid-cap companies tend to outperform the broader markets and industry giants during periods of economic boom, owing to higher consumer spending and bullish market sentiment. A low-interest-rate environment also increases these companies’ access to capital.
However, with surging market volatility, rising COVID-19 cases and geopolitical tensions, analysts predict big price swings in the coming period. Thus, we think relatively stable mid-cap stocks AutoNation, Inc. (AN), OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:OMF), Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:PAG), and Piper Sandler Companies (PIPR), which each has an A (Strong Buy) rating in our proprietary POWR Ratings system, could be ideal bets now.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 10:24AM ET</span>",Analysis-Stimulus-pumped stocks at risk as warning signals flash red,"By Tommy Wilkes and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Sky-high valuations and signs that the flood of cheap cash washing around financial markets may be subsiding suggest the record-breaking run in shares is about to hit the buffers. 
Banks including BofA,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) this week told clients to trim exposure to stocks. Some are predicting a sharp fall in prices.
Morgan Stanley is cautious on U.S. stocks and high-growth market segments that are very sensitive to rising interest rates, all the more so given September is a month when shares have typically tended to underperform. 
In another possible warning sign, the equity risk premium -- the extra return investors receive for holding stocks over risk-free government bonds -- has turned negative for the first time since 2002, consultancy BCA Research noted on Thursday.
This week has already seen signs of nervousness, with MSCI's World equity index down 1% from Tuesday's record high.
The index has nearly doubled from March-2020 lows hit when pandemic hysteria triggered a firesale of assets. The gains have been oiled by vast amounts of stimulus from central banks as well as governments, while economic growth and corporate profits have recovered faster than expected. 
Now the economic recovery may be running out of steam -- as suggested by data from the United States and China -- at the same time as bond yields could come under upward pressure from rising inflation and as policymakers begin a retreat from pandemic-era stimulus.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank took a small step towards dialling back bond purchases, following Tuesday's decision from the Reserve Bank of Australia to stick with its tapering schedule.
Citi's global markets strategist, Matt King, said his biggest concern was that the flow of public and private credit creation was on the cusp of turning negative, a significant moment for markets surfing the cheap cash waves. 
The reduction in private-sector credit creation -- which includes corporate and household debt -- would increase market dependence on central banks as the ""marginal sources of global liquidity"", just as policymakers take their foot off the pedal.
""It typically takes a positive delta (difference) to keep markets rallying -- and immediate prospects for both the credit and the Covid deltas seem overwhelmingly negative,"" he said.
""We cannot find any occasion when all the major components of the global credit impulse turned negative and there wasn’t a major sell-off somewhere,"" he added. 
Citi chart https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mopannxwbva/Citi.JPG 
BofA strategist Savita Subramanian noted paintmaker PPG -- among the companies whose fortunes are closely tied to the health of the economy -- has just ditched its 2021 earnings guidance due to supply chain disruptions.
Subramanian has an end-2021 target for the S&P 500 of 4,250, 6% below current levels. She sees the index just 2% higher from now by end-2022.
""Canaries are chirping,"" she wrote in a research note, adding that her valuation model implies annual returns on the S&P 500 will average -0.8% for the next decade, the first negative forecast since the 1999 tech bubble.
""This may not end now. But when it ends, it could end badly."" 
A put-call ratio on U.S. stocks signals investors are more bearish than at any time in 2021. 
stocks valuations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpykkxqzpg/stocks%20valuations.JPG 
Others disagree that a market correction is imminent, saying fears of a peak in prices are overdone. 
They point out that forces fuelling the rally -- low yields and cash-flush investors -- are intact. Small-time punters are pumping in cash too. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates record year-to-date equity fund flows of almost $700 billion are dominated by retail investors.

As for the risk of a market selloff,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts attribute the 2013 ""taper tantrum"" when markets tumbled to poor Fed communication, and say policymakers have since improved how they telegraph policy shifts. 
They point out that by the time policy tightening actually started, markets had steadied.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Thursday it will extend a shutdown of a Michigan assembly plant by two weeks in the aftermath of a new recall of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles over battery issues.
The largest U.S. automaker said the extension of the production halt at its Orion Assembly plant that will go through at least Sept. 24 was ""a result of a battery pack shortage"" related to the recall that followed reports of 10 battery fires. GM said it will not resume Bolt production or sales until it is satisfied that the recall remedy will address the fire risk issue.
GM in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules, at a cost now estimated at $1.8 billion. The automaker said it would seek reimbursement from GM battery supplier LG.
Separately, GM said all of its full-size truck and full-size SUV plants in North American will be running at full production next week.

GM's Ft. Wayne Assembly and Silao Assembly plants will resume full production on Monday after GM had to cut production this week because of the global semiconductor shortage.
GM said it will extend shutdowns for one week at Lansing Delta Township and Wentzville, along with an additional week of Chevrolet Blazer production downtime at Ramos in Mexico.

Investing.com – Boston Beer stock (NYSE:SAM) plunged 7% Thursday as continuing weakness in sales of seltzers forced it to withdraw its annual guidance.
To make matters worse, Kehoe is threatening a class action lawsuit. The law firm said it is investigating the company to determine if it engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.
In a note to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boston Beer said the market for hard seltzer products has continued to decelerate. The company now expects to incur hard seltzer-related inventory write-offs, shortfall fees payable to third-party brewers, and other costs that will be expensed during the remainder of the financial year.
As a result, Boston Beer currently expects annual earnings per share to fall below the previously-reported estimate of $18 to $22.
The company trimmed its forecast in July after seltzer sales dealt it a rude surprise. At that time, founder and Chairman Jim Koch said the market has matured and the consumption of the beverage has moved to on-premise channels. New entrants have proliferated, leading to more choices for the consumer, he said.
“Our outlook for the hard seltzer category in the second half of 2021 is uncertain and we have planned our capacity and spending based upon several volume scenarios,” he said then.
This came even as the company incurred much higher advertising and selling expenses due to investments in brands and more media spending.

(Reuters) - Global investors sold China-focused equity funds for the second straight month in August on concerns over a regulatory crackdown on local firms and the economic impact of the Delta coronavirus variant.
China-focused equity funds saw net sales worth $392 million, following outflows of $596 million in July, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed. 
The data covers 2,840 China-focused funds run by overseas fund managers.
Investors in China have been rattled by a flurry of regulatory crackdowns this year targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring, which have wiped out close to $1 trillion in market value since February.
""In the near term, the biggest concern is undoubtedly the potential regulatory changes that are still expected to come. Investors are anticipating what and where these changes will be,"" said John Lau, the head of Asian equities at wealth manager SEI. 
""There will be continual volatility across the highly anticipated areas, such as real estate, banking, health care, e-commerce, but might also expand to other industries as well."" 
The UBS (Lux) Equity Fund China Opportunity (USD), Aberdeen Standard SICAV I - China A Share Equity Fund and Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF faced the biggest outflows, in excess of $200 million each last month, the data showed.

As per a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) survey, Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd, Contemporary Amperex Technology and Midea Group were among the top 25 China A-shares held by large offshore mutual funds. 
The brokerage said global equity funds had been sellers of Chinese and Hong Kong equities this year as there were better and larger opportunities for them in U.S. equities. 
""Therefore, any increase in uncertainties or unattractive valuations could quickly induce risk-off sentiment among global equity managers to rotate out from China HK equities,"" it said. 
A deceleration in China's economic activity had also turned investors bearish. Still, to some analysts, Chinese equities look attractive after the recent sell-off.
MSCI China's forward price-to-earnings ratio stood at 13.57 at the end of last month, close to the 14-month low of 13.52 reached in July.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened Thursday a touch higher, futures reversing overnight losses as lower-than-expected jobless claims for last week calmed fears about the economy possibly slowing down. 
The Labor Department said that 310,000 people filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, a new post-pandemic low. The figures were consistent with August's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Wednesday, which also indicated a rapidly tightening labor market with another steep rise in vacancies.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 54 points, or 0..2%, at 35,085 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up in parallel.
The mood was also supported at the margins by news out of the European Central Bank, which stressed that its decision to slow the pace of its bond-buying over the next three months was not necessarily the start of a total phase-out of asset purchases.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock stood out in early dealing, falling 7.5% after disappointing with a lack of guidance for the rest of the year after its quarterly update late on Wednesday. The news revived concerns about how real the company's self-reinvention as a modern digital-first retailer really is. 
Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE), the south-east Asian multi-app conglomerate backed by Tencent Holdings, fell 7.2% after it announced plans to raise over $6.2 billion in fresh stock and debt. Sea is looking to capitalize on a sharp rise in its stock price over the last year, at a time when its rivals - especially in the gaming sector - are distracted by increasingly intense regulatory pressure at home. Tencent ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) fell 4.6% and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) fell 4.1% after China reportedly suspended the approval of new games while issuing more demands on how gaming companies conduct themselves.
There was better news from  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) stock, which rose over 11% after it raised its guidance for the full year, suggesting that demand for sports and casual wear should survive the mass return to the office.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock was dragged up 2.3% in sympathy, while  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) stock rose 1.2%.
Another stock in the exercise space to do well was Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), which rose 5.1% after the maker of connected fitness equipment said it will launch its own brand of apparel, something that should be more affordable than its exercise bikes and treadmills.
Energy stocks were mixed as crude oil prices fell sharply in response to China saying it will release oil from its strategic reserves in order to keep a lid on domestic prices.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock both fell by around 0.5%.
Elsewhere, Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), the company behind the Sam Adams family of brews, fell 7.5% to a new 15-month low after withdrawing its full-year guidance, a move that many took as signalling more weakness in the hard seltzer market, which had been a key part of the brewer's strategy to deal with changing consumer tastes."

(Reuters) - Mammoth Biosciences, co-founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, touched a valuation of more than $1 billion after raising $150 million in its latest funding round. 
Doudna, who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Emmanuelle Charpentier for developing the CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing tool, co-founded the biotech startup in 2017, with a focus on using the technology to develop diagnostics.
The San Francisco-based company, which is using CRISPR to develop a COVID-19 test, said on Thursday it hopes the latest funding will allow it to double down on the development of therapeutics.
""We've always known that many of these proteins could be transformative for therapeutic applications as well,"" said Chief Executive Officer Trevor Martin, who co-founded the company with Doudna and other members of her lab.
""In particular, what we are excited about (is) what we call permanent genetic cures.""
Martin said the discovery by Mammoth of newer and smaller proteins such as CAS14 could help overcome hurdles faced by older ones, including the CAS9 editing tool.
""These are compact cars compared to freight trucks of the existing previous technologies, and I think that's transformative for delivering these technologies in-vivo (in the body).""
The company, which counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Chief Executive Tim Cook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Verily as investors, declined to comment on a specific timeline for when a drug could begin being tested in humans. 

Mammoth has rapidly expanded to 110 employees as recent funding helped in beefing up its clinical teams. In late 2020, the company raised $45 million in a funding round.
The latest series D funding round was led by healthcare-focused hedge fund Redmile Group and other participants included Foresite Capital and Senator Investment Group.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 08:56AM ET</span>",U.S. airlines flag hit to bookings from surge in Delta variant,"(Reuters) - Several U.S. airlines on Thursday warned of a slowdown in ticket sales and cut revenue forecast as the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus threatens to blunt the recovery in travel that had started following the roll out of vaccines.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) expects third-quarter total revenue to be down about 24% to 28% compared with the same period in 2019. The company had previously estimated revenue to decline 20%.
The world's largest airline blamed the Delta variant for softness in bookings in August and said ""this weakness has continued into September and has resulted in a slowing of net bookings growth for close-in travel.""
Airlines were banking on a strong rebound in demand for air travel after being hammered by a collapse in business travel and the grounding of international flights. But the Delta variant has put a spanner in the works. 
Earlier this month, the Transportation Security Administration said it screened 1.345 million airline passengers on Aug. 31, the lowest daily number since May 11.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc expects revenue to fall 33% in the third quarter from 2019 and capacity to decline at least 28%, more than the 26% fall forecast earlier. 
Delta Air sees third-quarter adjusted revenue to be at the lower end of its forecast, while JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp expects current-quarter revenue to decline between 6% and 9% compared with its previous estimate of 4% to 9% decline.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said the company might incur a loss in the current quarter, warning that softness in leisure bookings has continued into September and October. 

Airlines, however, remained cautiously optimistic about demand picking up in the holiday season. JetBlue anticipates leisure demand for peak holiday travel ""will hold up relatively well.""
Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) said booking trends have stabilized in the last 10 days and expects recovery to resume.

Investing.com – Delta Air Lines stock (NYSE:DAL) traded 0.3% lower in Thursday’s premarket as the airline said its September-quarter revenue is likely to be at the lower end of the guidance it gave in July.
The company said the recent rise in Covid-19 cases has suppressed demand in the second half of the current quarter. It had guided for a 30%-35% fall in its July-September adjusted total revenue from the previous quarter's $2.6 billion.
The company said it is incurring higher costs to support restoration of the services and ensure adherence to operational reliability. Staff costs have risen, too, owing to the spread of the Delta variant. All this could inflate non-fuel costs by around 15% compared to the previous guidance of 11%-14%, it said.
Delta said demand exceeded expectations in July but that pace of recovery paused as Covid cases spikes and businesses delayed reopening. It said the environment remains choppy though booking trends have begun to stabilize.
The airline is reorganizing its schedules accordingly, it said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Packable, a U.S. e-commerce firm backed by  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc, said on Thursday it has agreed to merge with Highland Transcend Partners I Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal that values the combined company at $1.55 billion.
The deal includes $180 million of private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from Lugard Road Capital, Luxor Capital, Park West Asset Management and Morningside.
Packable, which operates third-party retailer Pharmapacks, was valued at about $1.1 billion when Carlyle invested $250 million to acquire its stake in November last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-carlyle-group-investment/carlyle-invests-250-million-in-u-s-e-commerce-firm-pharmapacks-idUSKBN27S1KW. 
Founded in 2010, it is one of the largest third-party retailers in the United States, selling mostly health and beauty products through large online marketplaces, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT). The Hauppauge, New York-based company generated $373 million in revenue in 2020 and expects that to reach $456 million this year.
""Packable will expand geographically, invest in founder-led brands, and add new verticals such as data science, marketing and media services,” Packable Chief Executive Andrew Vagenas said in an interview.
As part of the merger deal, Packable's existing shareholders will receive 71% of the combined company, Highland Transcend SPAC founders and investors will own 19%, while PIPE investors get the remaining 11%.
SPACs are shell companies that raise money from stock market listings with the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public. The Highland Transcend SPAC had raised $300 million in its initial public offering in December last year, including the underwriters' option.
Highland Transcend SPAC executives Ian Friedman and Dan Nova are expected to join Packable's board of directors after the deal closes.
""Our goal is to help the company expand further internationally, add new product categories such as shelf-stable food and pet,"" said Friedman, who is also chief executive of Highland Transcend ​Partners. 

Packable will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""PKBL.""

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 07:41AM ET</span>",EasyJet rejects Wizz bid and raises $1.7 billion to go it alone,"By Sarah Young and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) -EasyJet has rejected a takeover approach from Wizz Air that would have created a low-cost airline to rival Ryanair, opting instead to raise $1.7 billion from shareholders and go it alone in an industry battling to recover from the pandemic. 
EasyJet declined to name its suitor, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it was Wizz Air. Wizz also declined to comment.
EasyJet said the all-share approach fundamentally undervalued its business, and added the potential bidder had since said it was no longer interested in a deal.
The approach was ""highly conditional in its nature which made it very uncertain in terms of the deliverability,"" easyJet (LON:EZJ) CEO Johan Lundgren told reporters, without giving details.
EasyJet said the fundraising, its second of the pandemic, would strengthen its balance sheet should the COVID-19 downturn continue and allow it to operate more aggressively once the recovery arrives. It has identified landing slots across Europe it could acquire, including in Paris, Amsterdam and Milan. 
""I believe this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" Lundgren said. 
EasyJet, which during the pandemic sunk to its first ever annual loss and cut 4,500 jobs, wants to steal market share from legacy carriers like British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) and Air France-KLM as they retract their short-haul operations.
But it faces stiff competition from Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, and rapidly expanding Wizz, both of which have recovered faster than easyJet this year. 
Wizz is strong in eastern European destinations like Poland and Romania, while easyJet is well-positioned in countries including Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and France. Adding to their potential good fit, both also operate all-Airbus fleets. 
""EasyJet has always been a strategic target for Jozsef Varadi,"" said a senior industry source of the Wizz CEO. 
Based on passenger data from last year, when fewer people travelled during the pandemic, a combination of the pair would still lag Ryanair by almost 20 million passengers. 
Wizz, which counts aviation veteran Bill Franke as its chairman and his Indigo Partners as its biggest shareholder, has a market value of 5.1 billion pounds ($7 billion), while easyJet is worth 3.3 billion pounds. Its share price has also outperformed easyJet's. 
Shares in Wizz had bounced back to pre-pandemic levels by November 2020 and hit an all-time high of 5,595 pence in March. EasyJet's stock, by contrast, had recovered 70% of its pre-pandemic value by May 2021 before starting another decline.
RIGHTS ISSUE 
Illustrating the ongoing travel slump, easyJet said that over July-September it expected its capacity to be about 57% of pre-pandemic levels. Ryanair flew around 75% of its normal passenger numbers in August, and Wizz flew over 85% that month.
For the last three months of 2021 easyJet expects to fly up to 60% of 2019 levels, held back by Britain's slower return to international travel than the rest of Europe. 
The drawn out recovery has already forced easyJet to raise 5.5 billion pounds from shareholders and debt markets, and by selling and leasing back aircraft. It also announced a new $400 million debt facility on Thursday.
In June 2020, easyJet raised 419 million pounds from investors, but its biggest shareholder, founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, did not participate. The new rights issue, raising 1.2 billion pounds, represents a 35.8% discount on the theoretical ex-rights price of 638 pence per share on Sept. 8. 
Shares in easyJet, which were trading around 1,550 pence before the pandemic hit in early 2020, were down 10% at 710 pence at 1105 GMT, while Wizz was down 2%. 
James Halstead, managing partner at consulting firm Aviation Strategy, said the takeover announcement would normally mean easyJet was in play, but there were few alternative buyers due to high industry debt levels and competition issues. 

The rights issue is underwritten by BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Santander (MC:SAN) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).

BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc said it hired two Wall Street veterans as partners and promoted another executive to work in its Blackstone Credit unit as fresh demand from institutional and retail investors made it the private equity firm's fastest-growing segment.
Carlos Whitaker, a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) executive, and Chris Sullivan, an executive at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), will join Blackstone as senior managing directors while Kate Rubenstein, who works in Blackstone Portfolio Operations, will move to Blackstone Credit as a managing director, the company said.
Whitaker will become president of the Blackstone Private Credit Fund (BCRED) and the Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL), both part of the firm's global direct lending platform. At Credit Suisse he had been head of New York and co-head of EMEA Advisory Sales.
Blackstone Credit, run by Dwight Scott, oversees $163 billion in assets, and launched BCRED earlier this year to tap in to growing demand from retail investors for strategies including direct lending to securities backed by corporate loans. The portfolio had swelled to $14 billion by the end of July. The firm is taking in an average $4 billion in new cash a month for BCRED and its sister real estate portfolio for retail investors, BREIT, Blackstone said last month.
Overall, Blackstone oversees some $684 billion in assets including its credit, real-estate and hedge fund businesses. 

Sullivan will join as head of sponsor coverage at Blackstone Credit after having been global head of financial sponsors at Barclays.
Rubenstein will return to work at Blackstone Credit and be chief operating officer for BCRED and the BXSL.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 07:14AM ET</span>",How business travel may never be the same again,"By Emma Thomasson and Silvia Aloisi
BERLIN/MILAN (Reuters) - Sylvia Burbery is delighted that she no longer spends most of her life travelling for work.
""I am grateful that the pandemic has forced us to step back and look at ways of working we took for granted,"" said the regional president for emerging markets at Mars petcare brand Royal Canin.
""I am very happy not to go back to spending 80% of my time travelling. I am not even sure it will be 50%,"" Burbery said from her home office in Paris.
Burbery's sentiments are echoed by workers around the world who are tired of the grind of corporate travel. This is bad news for the airlines, hotels and conference centres that rely on this lucrative business.
Mars, the family-owned snack and pet food company, said cost, environmental and health considerations were behind its decision to keep travel to less than half pre-pandemic levels, meaning 145,000 fewer flights per year.
Nici Bush, Mars global vice president for workplace transformation, said reducing travel could also make senior jobs more attractive to people with families.
She said 700 staff members could attend online strategy or sales events compared with the 100 people who used to meet in person: ""You can really be more surgical about when you travel.""
Niklas Andreen, the chief operating officer of global corporate travel management firm CWT, knows the prospects are slim for a quick bounce back to pre-pandemic levels for the business travel sector.
While 58% of people polled by CWT say they are keen to resume expenses-paid junkets, bookings are only gradually recovering, with 80% of travel domestic now, compared with 67% pre-pandemic in 2019.
""It's going to take several years before we're back,"" Andreen said.
In one of the first tests of the appetite of the business community for global gatherings, Germany's auto show in Munich this week has seen many major car companies like Toyota and Jaguar's Land Rover choosing to stay away.
German airline Lufthansa has nevertheless seen demand for its regional flights between Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium jump 15% in recent weeks, and rise 30% for flights within Germany, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said.
Lufthansa is putting on more flights for business travellers in September, but it only expects a return to 90% of pre-pandemic trips in the long term.
COUNTING THE COST
Pre-pandemic, airlines made the bulk of their profits from business travel because companies are more likely to book at short notice and are prepared to pay more for convenient times.
U.S. spending on corporate travel is expected to only reach 25%–35% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021, and 65%–80% a year later, according to a Deloitte survey of 150 travel managers.
""As companies look forward, they are thinking about how to keep some of the cost savings they have realised,"" said Anthony Jackson, head of Deloitte's U.S. aviation practice. 
Italian fashion group Prada (OTC:PRDSY)'s chief executive Patrizio Bertelli said he thinks business travel would be ""reduced to a minimum"".
""This is certainly a big advantage for margins,"" he said earlier this year.
GREENER TRAVEL
Companies are also looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint: about half the respondents in the Deloitte survey said they plan to adjust their business travel policy to decrease their environmental impact within the next year.
""I used to fly from Dallas to New York for the day for an internal meeting with three or four people. I don't see that coming back very quickly,"" Jackson said.
As part of climate measures Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF) unveiled this week, it said it would cut air travel compared to its pre-pandemic level by 70% as of 2022.
The consulting arm of CWT is helping companies design travel policies that balance cost with environmental impact, for example proposing the lowest cost direct flight rather than a cheaper indirect flight with higher carbon emissions.
CLIENT CARE
However, CWT's Andreen said it was still important for some managers to get staff, and clients, together again.
""It's hard to close a deal without looking each other in the eye,"" he said.
And Burbery said some face-to-face meetings remain better for brainstorming and resolving tensions between staff: ""When you are virtual, you only see what people want you to see."" 
Meeting clients is seen as the top reason though to resume travel, according to the Deloitte survey, while internal meetings and training are more likely to stay online.

Filippo Baldazzi, CEO of silk manufacturer Serica 1870 which works with Brunello Cucinelli,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH, sends samples of fabrics to customers he can't visit in person.     
""I hate video calls and clients like Vuitton and Gucci want to be pampered, they expect a white gloves type of treatment,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, continuing the recent move lower as investors fret about the impact of the ongoing Covid outbreak on the economic recovery.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 30 points, or 0.2%.
The Federal Reserve confirmed Wednesday, in its latest Beige Book, a survey of recent economic conditions, that the U.S. economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August with dining, travel and tourism sectors hit by the coronavirus.
Adding to the worries is the uncertainty about when the central bank will begin tapering its bond-buying program, reducing its monetary stimulus.
The Fed has made great play of needing to see a recovery in the labor market before moving, but the picture has been mixed. The August official jobs report disappointed last week, but Wednesday’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed job openings outnumbered the unemployed by more than 2 million in July.
There are more data releases to study Thursday, with the weekly initial jobless claims expected to come in around 335,000, down from 340,000, while continuing jobless claims are expected to fall to 2.744 million, from 2.748 million the week before. Both reports are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
In corporate news,  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) will be in the spotlight after the retailer of athletic clothing offered up a strong full-year forecast as customers looked to maintain exercise regimes even after the easing of coronavirus restrictions.
Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) is seen trading sharply lower premarket after the brewer withdrew its earnings guidance amid concerns about the growth of its hard seltzer brand. 
Chinese gaming companies Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) also slumped in premarket Thursday on a report that Beijing has temporarily frozen new game approvals, with authorities continuing their regulatory clampdown.  
Crude prices stabilized Thursday as the impact of Hurricane Ida on the output of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region started to fade.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Wednesday, showed that crude drawdown for the week ended Sept. 3 was smaller than expected at just under 3 million barrels, but U.S. gasoline stocks fell by a hefty 6.4 million barrels.
Official crude supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the day.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 06:40AM ET</span>",China Evergrande bonds rebound as loan payment extensions ease default worries,"By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONGKONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Bonds of heavily indebted developer China Evergrande Group staged a late rally on Thursday on news that some creditors had agreed to loan payment extensions.
One source told Reuters that Evergrande has requested an extension for at least three months on a trust loan interest payment to CITIC Trust, one of its major trust creditors, which was due in late August, citing tight liquidity.
CITIC has agreed to the extension, the source with direct knowledge of the matter said. The source added that similar delayed interest payments have been seen across the trust sector.
CITIC dispatched a small team to Shenzhen, where Evergrande is based, last week, but it is not optimistic that Evergrande's liquidity will improve soon, the source added, citing difficulties in finding buyers for its assets and the country's strict mortgage policies.
News of the extensions came after a report on Wednesday said Evergrande would suspend interest payments due on loans to two banks later this month, as well as payments to its wealth management products. That report triggered steep falls in the company's onshore bonds and shares on Thursday.
Evergrande declined to comment. 
Regulators have warned that Evergrande's 1.97 trillion yuan ($304.7 billion) of liabilities could spark broader risks to China's financial system if not stabilised.
The company, China's second-largest property developer, said last September its liabilities involve more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.
ONSHORE BONDS, SHARES EXTEND SLIDE
The Shenzhen stock exchange temporarily halted trading in two Evergrande exchange-traded bonds on Thursday after their prices sank more than 20%. After resuming trade, Evergrande's 6.98% January 2023 bond fell more than 30%, triggering a second trading freeze.
They are now trading at roughly a third of their face value.
Evergrande's dollar bonds due June 2025 dropped about half a cent to 24.709, but later turned more than two cents higher as reports emerged of the deadline extensions.
""It might end up being positive news as it might draw a line in the sand"", said Siddharth Dahiya, head of emerging markets corporate debt at Abrdn, formerly  Standard Life  (LON:ABDN) Aberdeen plc.
""But we don't know, there is very little clarity... The first reaction (from the markets) is positive though."" 
Its Hong Kong-listed stock dropped more than 10% to HK$3.32, its lowest since July 8, 2015, before trimming losses to end down 4.3%. Evergrande shares have tumbled more than 76% this year.
Financial information provider REDD reported on Wednesday, citing sources briefed by banks, that Evergrande had told two banks it will suspend interest payments due on loans to the banks on Sept. 21, pending further instructions about an extension plan. 
Evergrande has also delayed payments to several trust firms other than CITIC, REDD said, and it might suspend all payment on its wealth management products starting on Wednesday.
Recent days have seen a series of downgrades by rating agencies including Fitch, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and China Chengxin International (CCXI) - the last of which made its yuan bonds unusable as collateral for repo financing.
Fitch Ratings cut the ratings of Evergrande and two of its subsidiaries to ""CC"" on Wednesday, adding a default appears probable, due to tight liquidity, declining contracted sales, pressure to address delayed payments to suppliers and contractors, and limited progress on asset disposals.
Fitch estimated the company faces bond interest payments of $129 million in September alone and $850 million before the end of the year. Refinitiv data shows nearly $7.4 billion worth of onshore and offshore bonds coming due next year.
With around $20 billion worth of outstanding offshore bonds, Evergrande is one of the world's largest emerging market corporate issuers.

Late last month, Evergrande warned of liquidity and default risks, and said it would adjust development timetables for projects, ""vigorously"" promote sales, renew or extend borrowings, dispose of equity interests and assets as well as introduce new investors to the group and its units to improve cashflow and reduce debt.

LONDON (Reuters) -British supermarket group Morrisons, at the centre of a bid battle between two U.S. private equity firms, warned industry-wide price rises were coming as it reported a 37.1% fall in first-half profit, partly due to more COVID-19 costs.
The group, which trails market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's and Asda in annual revenue, said inflation would be driven by recent sustained commodity price increases and freight costs, and the current shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.
Morrisons CEO David Potts said Britain's supply chain was creaking.
""That combination of a dearth of labour, a dearth of skills, the pingdemic and COVID cases does mean that everywhere in the supply chain there is strain,"" he told Reuters.
That has meant some in-store shortages of water, carbonates, juice, crisps, pet food and wine.
""We have still got an aisle full of water, we've still got pop to choose from, it's just not as wide a range as it was,"" he said.
The shortage of drivers has forced Morrisons to pick up stock from its suppliers that they would normally deliver to it.
Potts added his voice to widespread calls for HGV drivers to be added to the shortage occupation list so foreign labour can plug the gap.
LAST RESULTS AS A PLC?
In a results statement that looks likely to be Bradford, northern England-based Morrisons' last as a publicly listed company, it reported profit before tax and exceptional items of 105 million pounds ($144.5 million) for the six months to Aug. 1, down from 167 million pounds in the same period last year.
Morrisons, which trades from 497 stores and has a staff of over 110,000, said direct COVID-19 costs were 41 million pounds, while 80 million pounds of profit was lost in cafés, fuel and food-to-go areas because of the pandemic.
Total revenue including fuel rose 3.7% to 9.05 billion pounds, with like-for-like sales excluding fuel and VAT sales tax down 0.3% - falling 3.7% in the second quarter, having risen 2.7% in the first.
Despite the supply chain disruption, Potts forecast ""biblical"" Christmas demand this year as Britons will be keen to meet up in bigger numbers having been stopped by COVID-19 restrictions last year.
Morrisons maintained its guidance for full-year profit before tax and exceptionals including business rates paid to be above the 431 million pounds made in 2020-21, excluding 230 million pounds of waived rates relief.
Last month Morrisons agreed a 7 billion pound offer from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), which has former Tesco boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser.
However a rival consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group could still trump CD&R's bid and the battle looks to be heading for an auction process overseen by the Takeover Panel.
CD&R's latest offer is worth 285 pence per Morrisons share - a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid-June.

Morrisons shares were trading at 293 pence at 0951 GMT, indicating investors are hoping for a higher bid.

Investing.com – Lululemon stock (NASDAQ:LULU) surged 14% in Thursday’s premarket trade as the company raised its annual outlook for the second time after comfortably beating estimates in the second quarter.
Revenue and profitability jumped as the company continued to enjoy elevated demand for sports and casual wear, not just for exercising and outdoor activities but also during office working hours at home.
There was little sign of business slowing down as the economy reopens. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast by 6% to around $6.22 billion, up 40% on-year. Third-quarter revenue is seen at around a central estimate of $1.41 billion, down only fractionally from $1.5 billion in the three months through July. 
Makers of sports and leisure wear such as Lululemon,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) have been among the biggest winners of the pandemic, as lockdowns have allowed people to shun formal wear, while the release from commuting has given them more time for exercise. 
There were however some signs of changing shopping patterns as life returned to normal in the U.S. this spring. . Direct-to-consumer sales weakened, while the company opened 11 own-stores during the second quarter to close July with 534 outlets.
Adjusted profit per share more than doubled to $1.65 from 74 cents. The company repurchased stock worth $171.1 million during the quarter.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court on Thursday ordered authorities to withhold any final decision on Future Group's sale of $3.4 billion of retail assets for four weeks, prolonging its dispute with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has challenged the deal.
Amazon has for months argued Future violated certain contracts by selling its assets to Reliance Industries, an allegation the Indian retailer denies. The dispute has been taken before courts in India and an arbitrator in Singapore.
The Singapore arbitrator had stalled the deal in October, and Indian courts backed it, but Future Retail last month filed a new case against Amazon in India's Supreme Court in an effort to seek clearance for the deal.
The top court heard counsels for both Future and Amazon on Thursday and said Indian authorities should refrain from taking any decision on the deal for another four weeks. The court also stalled any other ongoing proceedings on the dispute in a lower court in New Delhi.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world's richest men, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Reliance's Mukesh Ambani, could reshape India's nearly trillion-dollar retail market if Amazon succeeds in weakening Reliance's dominance. 

The dispute started after Future, India's second-largest retailer, with more than 1,700 stores, including popular Big Bazaar supermarkets, entered a deal last year to sell its retail businesses to Reliance after COVID-19 hit its operations hard.
Future has argued that if the deal with Reliance doesn't go through it would cause ""unimaginable"" damage to the group, including possible job losses for 35,575 employees, and put at risk roughly 280 billion rupees ($3.81 billion) in bank loans and debentures.

(Reuters) -888 will buy William Hill's business outside the United States from casino group Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) for 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion), making a foray on to Britain's high streets with 1,400 betting shops.
The purchase, 888's largest since listing in London nearly two decades ago, will also give the company access to William Hill's 2 million active UK customers when pandemic curbs have spurred record online gambling volumes.
888 has until now been a pure online player, whereas William Hill's shops have long been a feature of British streets.
888 CEO Itai Pazner played down speculation that the company might seek to offload the retail stores to maintain its online focus.
""Our plans are absolutely to keep the shops. The shops are run well, they are profitable, they went through a big transformation in the last couple of years,"" Pazner told Reuters on Thursday.
Caesars' 2.9 billion pound takeover of William Hill in April was part of a wider consolidation, which saw several U.S. companies snap up London-listed groups to gain expertise as the United States opens up to sports betting.
Caesars had signalled it did not want to hold on to other parts of the group.
""We have found an owner for the William Hill business outside the U.S. which shares the same objectives, approaches and longer-term ambitions of that business,"" Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said.
COST SAVINGS
Pazner said the deal, classed as a reverse takeover under UK's listing rules because of the relative sizes of the businesses, would allow 888 to be more competitive and take market share in many of the core markets it operates in.
Besides the UK, William Hill, founded in 1934, also has operations in Spain, Italy and the Nordics. 
888, known for its online gaming, casino and poker, expects cost savings of at least 100 million pounds per year from the deal, which has the support of its largest shareholder, the Dalia Shaked Trust. The trust owns 23% of 888.
888 hopes to tap investors for 500 million pounds through a share sale ""at an appropriate time"", which weighed on its stock price in early trading. 
The Times reported earlier this week that 888 had outbid Apollo for the William Hill assets. 
888's shares, which have gained 40% this year, were down 1.4% by 0842 GMT, underperforming the wider index's 0.5% fall. 

888, with a market value of 1.5 billion pounds, said it has secured 2.1 billion pounds in debt financing from banks to fund the deal, which included 0.7 billion pounds relating to William Hill bonds.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Crown Resorts' auditor on Thursday warned that numerous money-laundering probes into the Australian casino operator and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cast ""material"" uncertainty over the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Crown has been embroiled in legal battles and scandal since allegations of money laundering at its Melbourne casino emerged in 2019. In June, financial crime regulator extended a probe into its flagship casino in Melbourne, to also include its operations in Perth.
The company, in which billionaire James Packer has a 37% stake, also said the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) was ""very likely"" to launch civil proceedings against its casinos in both cities. 
""If it does so, it is likely that Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth will be required to pay significant civil penalties,"" it said in its 153-page annual report released on Thursday. 
KPMG, Crown's auditor, also said the cancellation or suspension of any of its casino licences could trigger default on some of its debts. 
If that occurred, the report said Crown had negotiated some waivers with its financiers which would provide ""a period of time to negotiate with lenders or otherwise refinance the facilities"". 
Its bonds are also at risk of having to be repaid if its credit rating falls below investment grade, KPMG added.
""The conditions disclosed ... indicate a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the auditor said in the report.
To address a potential liquidity shortfall, the company had also obtained a waiver of financial covenants from its banks until the end of the year, and extended the maturity of its banking facilities until October 2023. 
It also secured an additional A$250 million debt facility commitment with its banks, which could be used to repay its bonds should it need to do so.

Crown shares, which have fallen 26% since its 2019 highs, were 1.5% lower to close at 9.76 on Thursday, slightly overperforming a wider market that fell 1.9%. 
The troubled firm has received takeover approaches from several suitors this year, including from investment giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and smaller rival Star Entertainment Group. However, both proposals have been withdrawn as Crown struggles to rebuild its image amid multiple Royal Commission enquiries.

Investing.com – Shares of Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) slumped Thursday on a report in the South China Morning Post that Beijing has temporarily frozen new game approvals.
Tencent closed 8.4% lower in Hong Kong and NetEase fell 7% in premarket trading on Nasdaq, in response to the extra pressure being exerted on the companies as Beijing pursues a broader crackdown aimed at bringing powerful tycoons to heel and curbing income inequality.
The decision had a cascading impact on shares of other Chinese companies.  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) traded 4% lower in premarket,  Alibaba  ADR (NYSE:BABA) 3.3%, JD.com  ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) fell 4.3% and Didi Global ADRs (NYSE:DIDI) fell 3.7%.
Tencent and NetEase have struggled with such bans before. In 2018 the authorities froze new game approvals on concerns that playing online games was hurting children’s eyesight.
The sell-off started with news that regulators had summoned the companies’ officials, and accelerated as reports dribbled out of a broad range of grievances aired by the authorities, including the ""sole pursuit of profit"", the risk of addiction among users, the concentration of market power in the sector, and ""violent"" and ""obscene"" game content as well as ""money-worship and effeminacy.”  
The meeting comes just ahead of new regulations coming into force that will limit children to playing videogames for no more than three hours a week, and only between Friday and Sunday. The onus of implementing the rules rests on the companies.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai-listed courier Aramex, partly owned by Abu Dhabi state investor ADQ, is in advanced talks to buy Turkish delivery company MNG Kargo, three sources said.
The potential deal, which one of the sources familiar with the matter said could be worth as much as $500 million, comes as relations between regional rivals the United Arab Emirates and Turkey show signs of improvement.
One of the sources said the talks were at an advanced stage and a second said the pair were engaged in due diligence.
""As a matter of course, we do not comment on rumour or speculation,"" an Aramex spokesperson said.
MNG Kargo declined to comment.
Aramex, in which ADQ bought a 22.25% stake last year, announced this week it has split its core businesses to capture growth in the post-COVID-19 transportation and logistics industry.
As part of the reshuffle, it has created a new regional structure and appointed a chief strategy officer to head its international expansion and merger and acquisition plans.
Established in 2003, MNG Kargo is one of the leading courier services companies in Turkey, owned by private equity firm Turkven and the Sancak family since 2017. The company has over 850 branches and more than 11,000 employees.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan held talks with UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al-Nahyan last month which included economic cooperation and UAE investment in Turkey.
Abu Dhabi conglomerate International Holding Co, of which Tahnoun is chairman, is seeking investment opportunities in Turkey, its chief executive officer told Reuters last month.

While political differences between the two countries run deep, Ankara has moved to ease tensions with several Arab powers over the conflict in Libya, internal Gulf disputes and rival claims to Eastern Mediterranean waters.
An Emirati official told Reuters this month the Gulf state was interested in reinforcing ties, pointing to trade and investment opportunities in transportation, health and energy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Accountants KPMG said on Thursday it had become one of Britain's first companies to set a target for staff from working class backgrounds to help close a pay gap and diversify its workforce.
Companies are already taking steps to diversify by increasing the number of women and ethnic minority employees, particularly in senior roles.
Targets for socio-economic background have featured less in corporate diversity efforts.
""We're setting a socio-economic background representation target for the first time, alongside our other diversity targets,"" KPMG said in a statement.
""We are aiming for 29% of our partners and directors to be from a working class background by 2030,"" said KPMG, one of the world's 'Big Four' accounting firms along with Deloitte, PwC and EY.
It has 582 partners and around 1,300 directors in Britain.
Currently 23% of KPMG's partners and 20% of its directors are from a working class background, with working class representation across KPMG’s board at 22%, dropping to 14% in its executive committee.
Staff from a professional background typically earn about 8.6% more than colleagues from a working class background, which KPMG defines as having parental occupations like receptionists, electricians, plumbers, butchers and van drivers.

""We’re training all our colleagues on socio-economic background, including the invisible barriers that exist."" KPMG said.
In July, the Financial Conduct Authority set out proposals to increase gender and ethnic diversity in Britain's board rooms and executive committees, and suggested companies could also consider other types of public disclosures, including sexual orientation, disability and socio-economic background.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - E-commerce and gaming company Sea Ltd is looking to raise $6.3 billion in a share and convertible bond sale in Southeast Asia's largest ever capital raising, tapping growing investor interest in the region.
This is the second major fund raising in less than a year for the $185 billion company, which is seeking to scale up its global expansion https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/seas-shopee-debut-europe-with-poland-launch-sources-2021-09-07 by testing out possible new markets, and the latest among a slew of deals in Southeast Asia.
Sea, known for its Shopee e-commerce platform, is looking to sell 11 million American Depository Receipts with the option to offer 1.65 million more as part of a so called greenshoe option, the Singapore-headquartered company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. 
It is also raising $2.5 billion in a convertible bond that has a $375 million greenshoe attached. At Sea's closing stock price of $343.8 in New York on Wednesday, the share sale could raise up to $3.8 billion.
The combined deal would be the largest ever capital raising for a Southeast Asian company, according to Refinitiv data. 
Sea is ""not really burning through cash"", Aequitas Research director Sumeet Singh said, adding the latest raising ""looks opportunistic rather than something that the company needs.""
Given Sea had nearly $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of first half, this deal will bolster that to nearly $13 billion, Singh, who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.
Sea, the biggest among all Southeast Asian companies by market value, plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including strategic investments and acquisitions.

(Reuters) -Comcast-owned NBCUniversal has recently sold 30-second ads for Super Bowl LVI for a record $6.5 million, and has nearly sold out advertising slots for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, a company executive said on Wednesday. 
The $6.5 million includes similar-sized investments in other NBC events like the Winter Games, the executive said.
The price marks an 18% increase over what ViacomCBS-owned CBS charged for Super Bowl ads this year.
NBC has a “few ad units” left for the Super Bowl and is purposely holding them back, Dan Lovinger, executive vice president of advertising sales at NBC Sports Group, said on a call with reporters.
Lovinger also said advertising for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, which is scheduled to begin on Feb. 4, is at “near sell-out levels.” The Super Bowl, set for Feb. 13, will be played at the same time as the Winter Olympics for the first time.
As viewing consumption becomes more fractured, live sporting events continue to be a big draw for advertisers looking for scale, despite declines in the TV audiences. 
U.S. viewership for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a competition delayed by a year and with few fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, dropped to about half the audience for the London Games in 2012.
February’s Super Bowl LV broadcast on CBS attracted about 92 million viewers, the lowest TV audience since 2006. A 30-second ad sold for about $5.5 million, about the same as the previous NFL title game.

The NFL remains one of the most valuable properties in media. In March, NBC extended its rights to air “Sunday Night Football” in a new deal that begins with the 2023 NFL season and runs through the 2033 campaign. It was valued at $2 billion per year. 
NBC and its new Peacock streaming service will broadcast and stream Super Bowls in February 2026, February 2030 and February 2034.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Merck KGaA on Thursday issued a more ambitious medium-term growth forecast for its Life Science unit, as manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments snap up its materials and gear. 
Life Science division revenues are now expected to grow 7% to 10% per year until 2025, excluding the effect of currencies and acquisitions, significantly above market growth and higher than a previous goal of 6% to 9%, the diversified company said.
Pandemic-related demand would subside until 2025 but underlying demand for lab supplies would continue to be driven by the development of new biotech drugs and by China's ambitions to nurture an innovative pharmaceutical industry.
""Life Science will sharpen its focus on the Asia-Pacific region, especially China, as well as on innovations and digital solutions in all businesses,"" the company said in a statement on its capital markets day on Thursday.
The shares were up 2.4% at 0730 GMT, outperforming a 0.6% decline in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index.
Demand from the biotech industry has also fuelled the rise of Franco-German lab gear and supplies maker Sartorius, competing with Merck in complex equipment, to soon join Germany's blue-chip index DAX.
Family-controlled Merck said it expects group sales to grow organically by more than 6% per year on average through 2025, driven by demand for the Life Science unit's bioprocessing products, new pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chemicals.
That would lift 2025 group sales to about 25 billion euros ($30 billion), up from 17.5 billion in 2020.
Having reduced its debt from the 5.8 billion euro takeover of electronics materials maker Versum in 2019, Merck will now boost investments in plants and equipment and research and development through 2025 by more than half compared with the previous five years.
It will also have close to 10 billion euros to spend on acquisitions from the end of next year, though smaller and medium-sized deals are more likely.

The Life Science unit, mostly made up of businesses formerly known as Millipore and Sigma Aldrich, has surpassed the pharmaceuticals unit as Merck's main earnings driver, now accounting for about 45% of adjusted group earnings.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, with investors cautious ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank against a backdrop of rising inflation and slowing global growth.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.2%.
Equity markets globally are struggling to post further gains amid concerns that the recent delta-variant Covid-19 outbreaks will slow the economic recovery just as central banks gradually begin to withdraw monetary policy support to bring inflation back down.
Data from China earlier Thursday amply illustrated the issue, as the country’s factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August, with the producer price index rising 9.5% from a year earlier in August, driven by sharply rising raw materials prices.
With this in mind, the European Central Bank’s meeting is the main focus Thursday, with the central bank’s policy makers widely expected to announce a timeline to slow its massive bond-buying program.
In corporate news, EasyJet (LON:EZJ) stock fell over 10% after the budget airline announced plans to raise 1.2 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) in a rights issue to fund its pandemic recovery, and added it had recently rejected a takeover offer. 
On the flip side, Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) stock climbed 2.2% after the German conglomerate lifted its growth forecast for its Life Science unit, a supplier of materials and lab gear for the biotech industry.
Additionally, Uniper (DE:UN01) stock climbed 0.9% to an all-time high. The German energy company is benefiting from European gas prices jumping to record levels on worries  over tight supplies heading into the winter heating season.
WM Morrison (LON:MRW) stock edged 0.2% higher despite the U.K. supermarket chain, which is in the middle of a takeover battle, reporting a 37% fall in first-half profit, hurt by Covid-19 costs.
Crude prices stabilized Thursday as the impact of Hurricane Ida on the output of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region starts to fade.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Wednesday, showed that crude drawdown for the week ended Sept. 3 was smaller than expected at just under 3 million barrels, but U.S. gasoline stocks fell by a hefty 6.4 million barrels.
Official crude supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the day.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $69.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $72.53. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,793.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1825.

(Reuters) - U.S. lockmaker Spectrum Brands Holdings (NYSE:SPB) Inc has agreed to sell its hardware and home improvement division to Swedish rival Assa Abloy (OTC:ASAZY) for $4.3 billion in cash.
Shares in Assa Abloy rose 6.2% in early trade on Thursday, buoyed by the deal and the prospects for expansion beyond its commercial business in North America into the residential market. 
Assa, the world's biggest lockmaker, expects operating earnings benefits from the deal to reach around $100 million in 2025, it said in a statement.
The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, would immediately add about 14% to Assa's consolidated sales, which were 88 billion crowns ($10.2 billion) in 2020.
""In summary, a great addition to Assa Abloy Group; really the missing piece for us in the Americas and in North America, the U.S. in particular,"" CEO Nico Delvaux told analysts and reporters.
Investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said the deal multiples were sensible.
""We see strong strategic rationale behind the deal, as it enables Assa to strengthen its position in the North America residential market,"" it said.
Shares in Spectrum had risen 18% on Wednesday after the company said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt and make complementary acquisitions.
The deal will also allow Spectrum to sharpen its focus on its pet care, home and garden and personal care businesses, with Chief Executive David Maura saying the downsized company would have higher growth rates and strong margins.
Spectrum's California-based hardware and home improvement division houses brands such as Kwikset, Baldwin and Weiser.
Demand for home improvement products has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as people largely worked from home during the health crisis.

Net sales at Spectrum's hardware and home improvement unit increased 48.8% from a year earlier to $419 million in the third quarter ended July 4, boosted by new products.

BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) is in advanced discussions to end its joint venture to build vans with China's state-backed Brilliance, a source close to the matter said, as the French firm overhauls its struggling Chinese operations. 
The tie-up dates back to 2017, when Renault and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd set up manufacturing operations in Shenyang, the provincial capital of Liaoning, and set out to make a push into electric commercial vans in particular. 
The Chinese market has proved difficult for some foreign producers, however, with sales faltering right before the COVID-19 pandemic, which walloped the industry.
Renault last year ditched its main passenger car business in China following poor sales at its loss-making venture with Dongfeng Motor Group. But it is making a fresh attempt to crack the market with Geely Holding Group, announcing in August a hybrid vehicle joint venture.
Renault said in a statement its joint venture with Brilliance was still beset by challenges despite a transformation plan set out in June 2020, but declined to comment on its possible end.
""We do not comment on market speculation,"" it said. ""The two shareholders have brought a lot of support (to the venture) and are in regular contact about the development of the group.""
Brilliance had no immediate comment. 
Brilliance's parent Huachen Group has defaulted on billions of yuan in debt obligations. Chinese regulators have launched an investigation into possible violations of disclosure laws by the company.

France's Les Echos newspaper, which reported the possible end of the tie-up, said the matter would be discussed at a board meeting of the joint venture this month.
Brilliance had not promised future investments in the joint venture for new models, the source close to the matter said, adding to Renault's doubts about the operation.

Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the U.S. Gulf Coast, hit Louisiana more than a week ago before moving northeast and causing intense flooding that killed dozens.
Risk modelling agencies' estimates for the hurricane's total insured losses range from $17 billion to $35 billion..
""Typically, if you looked at Lloyd's' exposure to those kinds of events, it would be about 10% of that number,"" Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters.
""Because of our market share in the U.S., we have a bigger exposure than we would, for instance, to continental flooding.""
North America is Lloyd's' biggest market.
Lloyd's, which reports the combined results of its 100-odd syndicate members, recorded a pre-tax profit of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.93 billion) in the six months to end-June, versus a loss of 400 million pounds for the same period a year earlier. 
Insurers suffered in 2020 due to hefty COVID-19 claims such as on event cancellation and trade credit cover. But after writing exclusions into contracts for the pandemic and raising premiums, they have performed strongly this year.
Premium rates rose 9.9%, Lloyd's said in a statement.
Lloyd's has also made a push in recent years for its members to exit loss-making insurance lines.
It launched its first sustainability strategy last year and is trying to put more of its business online and improve its record on diversity.
""Lloyd’s has successfully repositioned the market for sustainable, profitable growth,"" Chief Executive John Neal said in the statement.
""We are making great strides on all our strategic priorities which focus on improving the culture in the market, the Future at Lloyd’s digital transformation, and sustainability, climate and inclusion.""
Lloyd's had a combined ratio of 92.2%, compared with 110.4% a year earlier. A level below 100% indicates an underwriting profit.

Investors are increasingly uneasy at signs central bankers in Europe and elsewhere are mulling a retreat from the easy-money policies that have provided much of the ammunition for stock market gains. So ahead of an ECB meeting where a stimulus slowdown is likely to be debated, stocks are sliding.
September has already seen many major indexes, from the S&P 500 to STOXX 600, ease after multi-month winning streaks. Both European and U.S. equity futures point to more falls ahead on Thursday, while Treasury and Bund yields are off the mid-July highs hit earlier this week. 
But there's much more than an ECB meeting to fret about -- Beijing's regulatory crackdown shows no sign of a letup. 
Chinese gaming and media stocks - including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) - have suffered further sharp falls after regulators summoned gaming firms to ensure they implemented new rules for the sector. 
The impact of the widening crackdown is being felt as far as Tencent shareholder Prosus (OTC:PROSF) in Amsterdam which is set to open 3.5% weaker.
Shares and bonds in the embattled Evergrande Group too slumped further after media reports the property developer would suspend interest payments due on some loans and all payments on its wealth management products.
And then there is the U.S. debt ceiling quagmire, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning again that cash and extraordinary measures might run out in October. 
On the data front, China factory gate inflation jumping 9.5% to a 13-year-high in August shows no let up in price pressures. In Britain, a lack of new homes for sale boosted house prices again. 
Corporate news a-plenty too. EasyJet will raise more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) through a share sale. Similar news elsewhere in the travel sector too, with Japan Airlines announcing $2.7 billion in borrowing to weather the prolonged COVID-19 impact.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
ECB holds monetary policy meeting and presser
-Lloyd's of London swung to H1 pre-tax profit of 1.4 billion pounds, helped by rising premium rates
-Fed speakers: San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly 1205 GMT; Chicago President Charles Evans 1505 GMT
-Emerging markets: Malaysia, Peru, Serbia, Ukraine central bank meetings

The dressing down comes as tension between China and Western countries has fuelled patriotism and driven some shoppers to turn to home-grown labels.
""Basket of lies and wave of falsehoods,"" the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China's ruling party, said on its WeChat social media account, referring to the punishment for Canada Goose.
The state-owned China Economic Daily also singled out the down jacket manufacturer in a Wednesday editorial, highlighting how the administration for market regulation in Shanghai city fined its local unit 450,000 yuan ($70,000) for false advertising in June.
The market regulator said that instead of goose down, the jackets mainly use duck down and claims that a type of down known as Hutterite down was the warmest Canadian down misled consumers.
The China Economic Daily praised the market regulator for ""catching the lying Canada goose across the Pacific"".
Canada Goose and its China unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But it is not only Canada Goose that has come in for criticism, the newspaper said, adding that Chinese consumers were increasingly questioning their assumption that foreign goods were better.
""International brands have been caught doing wrong very often lately making internet users wonder if the foreign moon is still rounder than it is in China,"" the Youth League said in an article.
The China Economic Daily echoed that, saying: ""Consumers have come to understand that foreign brands do not necessarily represent high quality ... Chinese brands are on the rise.""
The newspaper also criticised Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s Magnum ice cream, saying it was made with cheaper ingredients in China compared with those used in Western countries.
Telephone calls to Unilever's office in China were not answered and the company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The Communist Youth League criticised the Japanese milk brand Yakult over false advertising.
In August, the administration for market regulation in Shanghai fined a Yakult unit 450,000 yuan for claiming in a promotion that probiotics had an ""important role"" in the prevention of COVID-19, according to a filing that the Youth League posted.

Yakult's China office did not immediately respond to telephone calls or an emailed request for comment.

The closure comes after Cathay put the London base under review in July and shut bases in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Germany this year in a bid to focus operations in Hong Kong, where pilots have taken permanent pay cuts to retain jobs. 
The London-based pilots, many of whom had not been flying since April 2020, will be offered a redundancy or the opportunity to move to Hong Kong, Cathay said in a statement.
""The decision is not one we have taken lightly and does not reflect on the professionalism of the pilots based in London,"" the airline said.
Cathay added that it would review its U.S. bases later in the year.
It declined to say how many jobs were affected. 

In June, Cathay resumed recruiting pilots with Hong Kong residency rights as part of its medium- to long-term planning, even though much of its fleet has been parked because of the pandemic.
In July, it reported a fall of 98.4% in passenger numbers from the corresponding 2019 month, before the pandemic hit, attributing the drop to tight border controls. But its air cargo business has performed better than before the pandemic.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two of Australia's largest lenders, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) and Westpac, on Thursday rejected criticism that they are stymieing competition by refusing to do business with cryptocurrency providers.
Many of Australia's top financial institutions have not engaged with the sector, despite its huge growth in the past year, due to its high risks. 
The stock exchange ASX Ltd, similarly has not allowed cryptocurrency-related listings, forcing some firms to seek public listings overseas, including on the Nasdaq.
""It's one of the emerging issues that we are looking at - what should our relationship be, if at all, with cryptocurrency,"" NAB Chief Executive Ross McEwan told a regular parliamentary hearing. 
The bank did not have a policy excluding crypto-related customers, but did not service any of them and would only do so if it was profitable and the bank could tolerate the risks, McEwan said. 
""We have to look at where does cryptocurrency go, along with ... the reserve bank and regulators. And what's the risk inside the bank of dealing with cryptocurrency providers as well.""
Peter King, the chief executive of Westpac, the country's second-largest lender, said the anonymity of cryptocurrency made it ""very hard"" to meet the bank's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing requirements.
Local digital currency exchanges Bitcoin Babe Pty Ltd and Aus Merchant Pty Ltd on Wednesday told a parliamentary committee exploring how to regulate the sector that none of the Big Four banks would do business with them. 

Singapore-based payments and remittances firm Nium on Wednesday also said that Australia had been the only country where it had been ""de-banked"", out of 40 where it operates.
""Today, fintechs are always one decision away by the banks from closing their businesses,"" Nium APAC head of consumer Michael Minassian said. ""It's time to cast an appropriate light on this anti-competitive practice.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Thursday, with investors cautious ahead of a key meeting of the European Central Bank against a backdrop of rising inflation and slowing global growth.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.9%.
Equity markets globally are struggling to post further gains amid concerns that the recent delta-variant Covid-19 outbreaks will slow the economic recovery just as central banks gradually begin to withdraw monetary policy support to bring inflation back down.
With this in mind, the European Central Bank’s meeting is the main focus Thursday, with the central bank’s policy makers having to decide whether the region’s recovery is strong enough to warrant an imminent slowdown in monetary stimulus. 
""The Covid-19 pandemic is clearly not over. Against this background, the ECB is unlikely to be ready to call an end to the PEPP [pandemic emergency purchase program] at its meeting,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Asian stock markets sold off earlier Thursday, hit by renewed concerns about China’s regulatory tightening after the country’s authorities summoned gaming companies, including Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES). to discuss new rules for the sector.
Additionally, China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August, with the producer price index rising 9.5% from a year earlier in August, driven by sharply rising raw materials prices.
In corporate news, quarterly earnings from WM Morrison (LON:MRW) will be studied carefully given the U.K. supermarket chain is currently in the middle of a takeover battle.
Numbers are also expected from Lloyd’s of London, and this follows reinsurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) saying it expected non-life insurance premiums to rise 10% above pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, driven in part by a growing need for protection against the impact of climate change.
Crude prices stabilized Thursday as the impact of Hurricane Ida on the output of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico region starts to fade.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Wednesday, showed that crude drawdown for the week ended Sept. 3 was smaller than expected at just under 3 million barrels, but U.S. gasoline stocks fell by a hefty 6.4 million barrels.
Official crude supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are due later in the day.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $69.39 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $72.75. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,788.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1814.

The company's research arm said it expected non-life insurance would hit $6.9 trillion worldwide this year, and pass the $7 trillion barrier in 2022 for the first time. Natural catastrophes like wildfires and floods combined with increased urbanisation were creating greater risks, it said.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",London's financial workers flock back to office in hot commuter crush,"By Lawrence White, Iain Withers and Rachel Armstrong
LONDON (Reuters) - There's no free lunch in finance - except when banks are wooing workers back to the office.
London's financial sector, keen to return to a semblance of normality after the worst of the pandemic, is leading the charge to encourage employees back to their old lives, with some companies even offering free food and social events.
It seems to be working; London's transport operator said this week it recorded its busiest day since the pandemic hit in March 2020, as workers filled once-deserted trains into the capital's twin financial districts of the City and Canary Wharf.
Canary Wharf Group, which runs that district, also said it was busier than at any time since last March. Crowds of office staff thronged its plazas, while City workers bustled on London Bridge and lounged by Tower Bridge in the resurgent September sun.
""It feels like London offices post the summer-holiday period should be starting to get back to normal in September and October,"" said Ian Williams, who works at investment bank Peel Hunt and was travelling back into his office in the City of London this week for the first time. 
Indeed Standard Chartered said that about 33% of staff were in the office this week, up from 20% last week and from a few dozen during lockdowns this year and last. 
The bank is among those getting creative in rewarding staff who make it into the office, in its case by providing free food.
Meanwhile Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), whose CEO has called home working an ""aberration"", is offering sweet temptation with a free gelato ice cream bar. 
The investment bank said around 3,000 workers came in to its Plumtree Court offices in London's City this week. That was roughly 50% capacity, and up six times from the peak of lockdowns when the bank operated with just 400-500 staff in per day, it added. 
Daily occupancy at HSBC's headquarters in Canary Wharf rose to 1,800 people out of a possible 3,500 this week, from a recent average of 1,000-1,500, the bank told Reuters, and more are expected to join the crowd in the next few weeks.
There's no such thing as a free lunch there, though. 
The bank has not prioritised offering incentives like free food, its UK CEO Ian Stuart told Reuters, in recognition of the fact that some 10,000 branch staff have come in to work every day through the pandemic without such lures.
""We are trying to communicate very effectively that the offices are safe, the first hurdle is getting people to come in and try it and more and more are doing that,"" he said. 
'BACK GETTING CRUSHED ON TRAIN'
A similar office influx is happening in the United States, albeit cautiously amid fears about the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) expects staff to come back to offices in New York and other big cities two days a week from Sept. 13, but only if they have been vaccinated.
Senior executives face a tricky task in encouraging staff back to work at a time when cases of COVID-19 are still on the rise in Britain and commuter trains above and below ground are baking under near-record temperatures for September.
""It's a bit crazy, suddenly we're back to getting crushed on the train and not everyone is wearing a mask,"" Rob, who works for a financial firm, told a Reuters reporter on Tuesday on a train into London's City district.
""I'd had enough of sitting at home, to be honest.""
Investment bank executives have been among the most vocal on the need for staff to return to the office. 
They hope that the novelty of office working after a year and half at home, plus the lure of mingling with senior executives who might open the door to promotion, will outweigh health concerns among young City staff.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has seen about 35% of its staff in its Canary Wharf office this week, the highest proportion since the first UK lockdown began and a number it expects to rise. 
Other companies are poised to follow suit, including retail bank NatWest, which is planning a phased return from next week starting with 50% occupancy in its offices in England and Scotland. 

Insurer Phoenix Group has adopted another novel strategy for helping staff readjust to returning to its offices, including in the City.
It has run ""safely social events"" this week, where employees were offered free food and soft drinks as well as coloured lanyards to show how comfortable they were with levels of interaction - ranging from ""I'm keeping my distance"" to ""I'm OK with high-fives"".

Investment is not a virtual game and investors buying Chinese stocks hoping to profit from Metaverse will likely end up in tears, China's official Securities Times warned in a commentary on Thursday.
If people ""blindly invest in such grand and illusionary concept as Metaverse, they will be burnt in the end,"" it said. 
The commentary came a day after the Shenzhen Stock Exchange sent a letter to Zhejiang Jinke Culture Industry Co, urging the mobile Internet firm to substantiate its claim that it has the customer base to develop Metaverse products. 
The bourse also asked if the company - whose share prices surged roughly 35% this week - played a part in boosting its own stocks with the hot concept. 
Most Metaverse-related stocks tumbled on Thursday morning.
Wondershare Technology and Wahlap Technology both slumped over 10%, while Goertek lost over 8%. AVIT Ltd tumbled 13%, while Perfect World shed 5%. 
China's top securities regulator, Yi Huiman, told a conference on Monday that exchanges should have a better understanding of investor behaviours in the Internet age.
Yi's comment comes amid heightened concerns over Chinese regulators, as Beijing launched a flurry of crackdowns this year on sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring.
Shenzhen Zhongqingbao Interaction Network, whose shares surged over 60% this week after the company publicly posted an article about Metaverse, said in an exchange filing on Wednesday that it is still in initial stages to explore the business, and cautioned investors against risks. 

The Securities Times commentary also flagged risks to investors on Thursday.
""It's important for investors to tell the difference between genuine trends, and beautiful 'bubbles'.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) said on Thursday it planned to raise around 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of subordinated loans and hybrid financing to help it weather the prolonged impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Details of the funding plan will be announced on Friday, the company said in a statement after news organisations including Reuters earlier reported on the plan, citing sources.
""We are considering various ways to secure financing, in order to prepare for the long-term effects of the spread of coronavirus infections, and in order to achieve the growth targets laid out in JAL's medium term business plan,"" the airline said.
JAL last month posted a first-quarter operating loss of 82.65 billion yen, an improvement from a year earlier, as pandemic-related cost cuts took effect and travel demand rose from a very low base.
JAL, like other carriers, has been burning through cash reserves to keep jets and workers it will need when travel demand rebounds. It raised $1.8 billion in a share sale last November.
The airline last month said it expected its cash burn rate to fall to around 5 billion yen a month in the second quarter ending Sept. 30 from 10 to 15 billion yen a month in the first quarter. 
Rival ANA Holdings Inc last year raised $3.8 billion in subordinated loans and $3.2 billion of equity to help it weather the pandemic and fund the purchase of new planes.

JAL shares were down 0.8% in afternoon trade, in line with the decline in the broader market.

Japanese car companies have already had to cut production this month because of difficulties finding semiconductors and other components as the pandemic disrupts manufacturing around the world and drives up demand for chips from consumer electronic device makers.

The possibility that central banks will gradually begin to withdraw monetary policy support is also of concern, ahead of the European Central Bank handing down its policy decision later in the day.
Fed Bank of New York president John Williams said “it could be appropriate” for the Fed to begin asset tapering before the end of 2021 in the latest comments on a timeline.
However, other factors are also contributing to shares’ slowdown, according to some investors.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Abu Dhabi locked in $3 billion on Wednesday with its second bond sale of the year for which it received more than $9.75 billion in orders for two tranches, a bank document showed.
The emirate sold $1.75 billion in 10-year bonds at 63 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries (UST) and $1.25 billion in 30-year paper at 3%, settling at the lower end of final price guidance, the document from one of the banks on the deal showed.
It had given an initial price guidance of about 90 bps over UST for the 10-year tranche and around 130 bps over UST for the 30-year notes.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), First Abu Dhabi Bank, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) arranged the deal.
Gulf governments are seeking to lock in funding while rates remain at historic lows, despite a rebound in oil that reversed their fortunes after their economies were battered by last year's historic price crash, along with the impact of the pandemic.
Two sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters Abu Dhabi would likely raise around $3 billion. The emirate sold $2 billion in seven-year bonds in May, after hauling in $15 billion from bond issues last year.
Abu Dhabi is expected to post a deficit of $11.7 billion in 2021, although the budget was drafted on an oil price assumption of $46 a barrel. Brent crude was trading at around $72 on Wednesday.

As of end-June 2021, Abu Dhabi had $39.5 billion in outstanding bonds and $3.7 billion in loans from local banks, while it had $2.4 billion in explicitly guaranteed obligations, an investor presentation reviewed by Reuters showed.
Entities owned by the government had borrowed approximately $59.2 billion as of the end of June last year, the presentation showed, although the emirate does not guarantee the debt issued by its wholly-owned entities.

(Reuters) -Bill Gates' Cascade Investment LLC is taking control of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts by buying about half of Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's stake for $2.21 billion, the hotel operator said on Wednesday.
Cascade will acquire half of the billionaire prince's stake in Four Seasons, raising its ownership to 71.3% and valuing the hotel chain at $10 billion on an enterprise basis.
Prince Alwaleed, through investment vehicle Kingdom Holding Co, will continue to own the remaining stake, Four Seasons said in a statement. 
While the prince owns stakes in many companies such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and ride-hailing firm  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), his investment firm has been selling its stakes in hotels over the last 10 years.
Prince Alwaleed was freed in early 2018 after being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel with scores of royals, senior officials and businessmen as part of Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption drive.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft warned some of its Azure cloud computing customers that a flaw discovered by security researchers could have allowed hackers access to their data.
In a blog post from its security response team, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it had fixed the flaw reported by Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and it had no evidence malicious hackers had abused the technique.
It said it had notified some customers they should change their login credentials as a precaution.
The blog post https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/09/08/coordinated-disclosure-of-vulnerability-in-azure-container-instances-service followed questions from Reuters about the technique described by Palo Alto. Microsoft did not answer any of the questions, including whether it was confident no data had been accessed.
In an earlier interview, Palo Alto researcher Ariel Zelivansky told Reuters his team had been able to break out of Azure's widely used system for so-called containers that store programs for users.
The Azure containers used code that had not been updated to patch a known vulnerability, he said.
As a result the Palo Alto team was able to eventually get full control of a cluster that included containers from other users.
""This is the first attack on a cloud provider to use container escape to control other accounts,"" said longtime container security expert Ian Coldwater, who reviewed Palo Alto's work at Reuters' request.
Palo Alto reported the issue to Microsoft in July. Zelivansky said the effort had taken his team several months and he agreed that malicious hackers probably had not used a similar method in real attacks.
Still, the report is the second major flaw revealed in Microsoft's core Azure system in as many weeks. In late August, security experts at Wiz described a database flaw that also would have allowed one customer to alter another's data https://www.reuters.com/technology/researchers-cybersecurity-agency-urge-action-by-microsoft-cloud-database-users-2021-08-28.
In both cases, Microsoft's acknowledgment focused on those customers who might have been somehow affected by the researchers themselves, rather than everyone put at risk by its own code.
""Out of an abundance of caution, notifications were sent to customers potentially affected by the researcher activities,"" Microsoft wrote on Wednesday.
Coldwater said the problem reflected a failure to apply patches in a timely fashion, something Microsoft has often blamed its customers for.
""Keeping code updated is really important,"" Coldwater said. ""A lot of the things that made this attack possible would no longer be possible with modern software.""
Coldwater said that some security software used by cloud customers would have detected malicious attacks like the one envisioned by the security company, and that logs would also show signs of any such activity.
The research underscored the shared responsibility between cloud providers and customers for security.

Zelivansky said cloud architectures are generally safe, while Microsoft and other cloud providers can make fixes themselves, rather than rely on customers to apply updates.
But he noted that cloud attacks by well-funded adversaries, including national governments, are ""a valid concern.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Major U.S. airlines plan to announce on Thursday that they will back a voluntary industry target of 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in 2030 as the White House looks to reduce aviation sector emissions, sources told Reuters.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, in March had set a 2030 goal of producing and deploying 2 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF, made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat, at present accounts for only a miniscule amount of overall jet fuel use.
The group declined to comment Wednesday. A White House virtual event on sustainable aviation is set for Thursday, industry and government officials said.
The target for sustainable aviation fuel will be detailed at that event, sources briefed on the matter said. 
The airline group, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and others, will pledge to work with the U.S. government and others to help rapidly expand production and deployment of ""commercially viable"" SAF, sources said.
Asked for comment on the meeting, White House aide Ali Zaidi said in a statement ""we need to move quickly to support the technology innovation and infrastructure needed to shift to more sustainable fuels now – and make real progress by the end of this decade.""
The White House meeting will discuss the administration’s ""whole-of-government strategy to achieve a net zero carbon aviation sector by 2050"" and will include airlines, fuel providers, airports, unions, and aircraft manufacturers.
The industry participants ""will share commitments to reduce emissions in the aviation sector through improvements in aircraft technology, fuels, and operational improvements,"" according to an invitation seen by Reuters.
Airlines and the Biden administration back new tax credits for SAF that are expected to be included in a massive spending bill in Congress that are crucial to making the fuel economically viable.
A White House official told Reuters the administration had pushed airlines ""on sustainability and the potential of reducing their emissions by 2030.""

The push to increase production of sustainable aviation fuel is also seen by the Biden administration as a way to help provide new businesses for the nation's refining industry and the thousands of union jobs who rely on their success.
On Tuesday,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) said it plans to produce a test batch of SAF and sell it to Delta at the Los Angeles International Airport. Delta has pledged to replace 10% of its jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday, spooked by worries that the Delta coronavirus variant could blunt the economy's recovery and on uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may pull back its accommodative policies.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell about 1% after helping push the Nasdaq to record highs in the previous session. The dips in those two Silicon Valley giants contributed more than any other companies to the S&P 500's decline for the session. 
Investors have become more cautious following Friday's weak August payrolls data, while pressures from rising costs, despite the economy slowing, have increased concerns that the Fed could move sooner than expected to scale back massive monetary measures enacted last year to shield the economy from the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August as concerns grew over how the renewed surge of coronavirus cases would affect the economic recovery, the Fed said on Wednesday in its latest Beige Book compendium of anecdotal reports about the economy.
The S&P 500 has dipped less than 1% from its record closing high last Thursday, and it remains up 20% year to date, buoyed by the Fed's accommodative monetary policy.
""Investors are pulling petals from a daisy, saying, 'The economy will grow, the economy won't grow,'"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""They can’t make up their minds, so they have not commitment to long-term positions."" 
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard told the Financial Times that the Fed should move forward with a plan to trim its pandemic stimulus program despite a slowdown in job growth. 
Six of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with materials and energy the deepest decliners, down over 1% each.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to end at 35,031.07 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.13% to 4,514.07.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.57% to 15,286.64.
Perrigo Company (NYSE:PRGO) Plc jumped 9% after the drugmaker said it plans to buy HRA Pharma from investment firms Astorg and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in a deal valued at 1.8 billion euros ($2.13 billion).
Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc fell 3.2% after the U.S. securities regulator threatened to sue the firm if it goes ahead with plans to launch a crypto lending scheme.
U.S. payments giant  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) declined 2.7% after it said it would acquire Japanese buy now, pay later firm Paidy in a $2.7 billion largely cash deal.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.5 billion shares, compared with the 9.1 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 41 new lows.

(Reuters) -Lululemon Athletica Inc forecast annual revenue and profit above estimates on Wednesday, as demand for its comfortable leggings and sports bras remained strong despite the easing of coronavirus restrictions. 
Shares rose 13% to $430.62 after the company also posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors traded more than $500 million worth of shares after the bell, according to Refinitiv data.
Sportswear makers saw strong demand over the past year as people worked out at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, spurring sales of Lululemon and other athletic wear makers, including  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA).
However, apparel makers are now facing supply chain hiccups due to the new coronavirus-led lockdowns in Vietnam, as they rely heavily on the southeast Asian country for manufacturing.
""Another wave of COVID-19 and related factory closures in Vietnam, ongoing issues at the ports and reduced air freight capacity are contributing to some disruptions within the supply chain as well as increased costs,"" Calvin McDonald, Lululemon's chief executive officer, said in a post-earnings call.
The company, however, added it was working on shifting production out of Vietnam wherever possible, increasing the use of air freight and prioritizing production for key fall holiday styles to mitigate its supply chain woes. 
The owner of Mirror home-fitness platform said it now expects annual net revenue to be in the range of $6.19 billion to $6.26 billion, above estimates of $5.94 billion.
Lululemon forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.38 and $7.48, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.91.

Net revenue rose by 61% to $1.45 billion in the second quarter, beating estimates of $1.34 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
On an adjusted basis, Lululemon earned $1.65 per share, compared with estimates of $1.19 per share.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 06:48PM ET</span>","Money, mimicry and mind control: Big Tech slams ethics brakes on AI","By Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In September last year, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s cloud unit looked into using artificial intelligence to help a financial firm decide whom to lend money to. 
It turned down the client's idea after weeks of internal discussions, deeming the project too ethically dicey because the AI technology could perpetuate biases like those around race and gender. 
Since early last year, Google has also blocked new AI features analyzing emotions, fearing cultural insensitivity, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) restricted software mimicking voices and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) rejected a client request for an advanced facial-recognition system. 
All these technologies were curbed by panels of executives or other leaders, according to interviews with AI ethics chiefs at the three U.S. technology giants.
Reported here for the first time, their vetoes and the deliberations that led to them reflect a nascent industry-wide drive to balance the pursuit of lucrative AI systems with a greater consideration of social responsibility.
""There are opportunities and harms, and our job is to maximize opportunities and minimize harms,"" said Tracy Pizzo Frey, who sits on two ethics committees at Google Cloud as its managing director for Responsible AI.
Judgments can be difficult. 
Microsoft, for instance, had to balance the benefit of using its voice mimicry tech to restore impaired people's speech against risks such as enabling political deepfakes, said Natasha Crampton, the company's chief responsible AI officer.
Rights activists say decisions with potentially broad consequences for society should not be made internally alone. They argue ethics committees cannot be truly independent and their public transparency is limited by competitive pressures. 
Jascha Galaski, advocacy officer at Civil Liberties Union for Europe, views external oversight as the way forward, and U.S. and European authorities are indeed drawing rules for the fledgling area.
If companies' AI ethics committees ""really become transparent and independent – and this is all very utopist – then this could be even better than any other solution, but I don't think it's realistic,"" Galaski said.
The companies said they would welcome clear regulation on the use of AI, and that this was essential both for customer and public confidence, akin to car safety rules. They said it was also in their financial interests to act responsibly.
They are keen, though, for any rules to be flexible enough to keep up with innovation and the new dilemmas it creates. 
Among complex considerations to come, IBM told Reuters its AI Ethics Board has begun discussing how to police an emerging frontier: implants and wearables that wire computers to brains. 
Such neurotechnologies could help impaired people control movement but raise concerns such as the prospect of hackers manipulating thoughts, said IBM Chief Privacy Officer Christina Montgomery.
AI CAN SEE YOUR SORROW
Tech companies acknowledge that just five years ago they were launching AI services such as chatbots and photo-tagging with few ethical safeguards, and tackling misuse or biased results with subsequent updates. 
But as political and public scrutiny of AI failings grew, Microsoft in 2017 and Google and IBM in 2018 established ethics committees to review new services from the start.
Google said it was presented with its money-lending quandary last September when a financial services company figured AI could assess people's creditworthiness better than other methods. 
The project appeared well-suited for Google Cloud, whose expertise in developing AI tools that help in areas such as detecting abnormal transactions has attracted clients like  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC and BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK).
Google's unit anticipated AI-based credit scoring could become a market worth billions of dollars a year and wanted a foothold.
However, its ethics committee of about 20 managers, social scientists and engineers who review potential deals unanimously voted against the project at an October meeting, Pizzo Frey said.
The AI system would need to learn from past data and patterns, the committee concluded, and thus risked repeating discriminatory practices from around the world against people of color and other marginalized groups. 
What's more the committee, internally known as ""Lemonaid,"" enacted a policy to skip all financial services deals related to creditworthiness until such concerns could be resolved. 
Lemonaid had rejected three similar proposals over the prior year, including from a credit card company and a business lender, and Pizzo Frey and her counterpart in sales had been eager for a broader ruling on the issue.
Google also said its second Cloud ethics committee, known as Iced Tea, this year placed under review a service released in 2015 for categorizing photos of people by four expressions: joy, sorrow, anger and surprise.
The move followed a ruling last year by Google's company-wide ethics panel, the Advanced Technology Review Council (ATRC), holding back new services related to reading emotion.
The ATRC - over a dozen top executives and engineers - determined that inferring emotions could be insensitive because facial cues are associated differently with feelings across cultures, among other reasons, said Jen Gennai, founder and lead of Google's Responsible Innovation team.
Iced Tea has blocked 13 planned emotions for the Cloud tool, including embarrassment and contentment, and could soon drop the service altogether in favor of a new system that would describe movements such as frowning and smiling, without seeking to interpret them, Gennai and Pizzo Frey said.
VOICES AND FACES
Microsoft, meanwhile, developed software that could reproduce someone's voice from a short sample, but the company's Sensitive Uses panel then spent more than two years debating the ethics around its use and consulted company President Brad Smith, senior AI officer Crampton told Reuters.
She said the panel - specialists in fields such as human rights, data science and engineering - eventually gave the green light for Custom Neural Voice to be fully released in February this year. But it placed restrictions on its use, including that subjects' consent is verified and a team with ""Responsible AI Champs"" trained on corporate policy approve purchases.
IBM's AI board, comprising about 20 department leaders, wrestled with its own dilemma when early in the COVID-19 pandemic it examined a client request to customize facial-recognition technology to spot fevers and face coverings. 
Montgomery said the board, which she co-chairs, declined the invitation, concluding that manual checks would suffice with less intrusion on privacy because photos would not be retained for any AI database. 
Six months later, IBM announced it was discontinuing its face-recognition service.
UNMET AMBITIONS
In an attempt to protect privacy and other freedoms, lawmakers in the European Union and United States are pursuing far-reaching controls on AI systems. 
The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act, on track to be passed next year, would bar real-time face recognition in public spaces and require tech companies to vet high-risk applications, such as those used in hiring, credit scoring and law enforcement.
U.S. Congressman Bill Foster, who has held hearings on how algorithms carry forward discrimination in financial services and housing, said new laws to govern AI would ensure an even field for vendors.
""When you ask a company to take a hit in profits to accomplish societal goals, they say, 'What about our shareholders and our competitors?' That's why you need sophisticated regulation,"" the Democrat from Illinois said.
""There may be areas which are so sensitive that you will see tech firms staying out deliberately until there are clear rules of road.""
Indeed some AI advances may simply be on hold until companies can counter ethical risks without dedicating enormous engineering resources.
After Google Cloud turned down the request for custom financial AI last October, the Lemonaid committee told the sales team that the unit aims to start developing credit-related applications someday.

First, research into combating unfair biases must catch up with Google Cloud's ambitions to increase financial inclusion through the ""highly sensitive"" technology, it said in the policy circulated to staff.
""Until that time, we are not in a position to deploy solutions.""

(Reuters) -U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday he is waiting for a legal opinion before deciding whether to approve Minnesota's Twin Metals copper mining project, which labor unions support but environmentalists strongly oppose. 
""We continue to wait for the Department of the Interior. They have to issue a legal opinion before we know what direction we need to take"" at the Agriculture Department, Vilsack told a White House news conference.
The U.S. Forest Service, part of the Agriculture Department, controls the surface land at the site. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, part of the Interior Department, controls the underground copper deposit and must approve plans to extract minerals. 
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland declined to discuss the project https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-interior-leasing-idCNL2N2O51QZ when asked at a congressional hearing this year by U.S. Representative Pete Stauber, a Minnesota Republican whose district includes the mine site.
The proposed underground mine would, if built, be a major U.S. copper supplier as President Joe Biden aims to build more electric vehicles, which use twice as much of the red metal as those with internal combustion engines. Opponents fear the project would permanently mar the Boundary Waters (NYSE:WAT) Canoe Area Wilderness on the U.S.-Canada border. 
Twin Metals has said the project can be constructed safely and in a way that boosts the region's economy.
Vilsack had blocked the Twin Metals project when he served as agriculture secretary under President Barack Obama, only to see that decision reversed by President Donald Trump's administration. 
Vilsack in June said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-antofagasta-idCAKBN2CM1WS that as part of his deliberations he was trying to balance environmental concerns and economic potential.

Twin Metals, controlled by Chile's  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc, said in a statement it ""looks forward to continuing to constructively engage the administration and advance the environmental review of the project."" 
Vilsack has the power to block mining in the region for 20 years, though a bill introduced in the U.S. Congress this year could permanently ban it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines employees who receive religious exemptions from the company for COVID-19 vaccinations will be placed on temporary, unpaid personal leave from Oct. 2, the U.S. airline said in a Wednesday memo to staff.
The company said the employees will be allowed to return to their work location once new testing and safety procedures are in place. 
The U.S. carrier is taking a tough line on employees who decline to get vaccinated and became the first U.S. carrier in early August to announce it would mandate vaccines for employees.
United said in the memo ""more than half of our employees who were unvaccinated on the day (Aug. 6) we announced the requirement are now vaccinated.""
""Given the dire statistics listed above, we can no longer allow unvaccinated people back into the workplace until we better understand how they might interact with our customers and their vaccinated coworkers,"" the airline said the memo. 
For pilots and flight attendants and other customer-facing employees winning religious exemptions they will remain off work indefinitely.
""Once the pandemic meaningfully recedes, you will be welcomed back to the team on active status,"" United said.
For some employees in non-customer facing roles, United will more quickly allow return to work but require unvaccinated employees to ""undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, wear a mask at all times.""
United said for some employees an ""official return to work date might be significantly later"" than mid-October.
Employees whose requests for religious exemptions are denied must be vaccinated within five weeks or they will be fired, United said.
United said the restriction and requirements are similar for employees seeking medical exemptions but employees winning exemptions will be placed on temporary medical leave.
On Friday, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it would not provide special leave starting next month to unvaccinated employees who have to quarantine due to COVID-19.

Last month, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not be vaccinated against COVID-19.
On Wednesday, WestJet Group in Canada said effective Oct. 30 employees will be required to be fully vaccinated.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday charged a former employee of Swedish telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) with scheming to bribe Djibouti government officials in order to win business with a state-owned telecommunications company.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Afework Bereket, 53, a former employee of Ericsson Egypt, helped arrange $2.1 million in bribes to at least three Djibouti officials so Ericsson could win a 20.3 million euro (US$24 million) contract.
Prosecutors said the scheme ran from 2010 to January 2014, and included bribes disguised as payments to a company with which Ericsson's branch office in Ethiopia had entered a sham consulting agreement.
Bereket's indictment included an email where prosecutors said he urged that one payment be made ""ASAP"" because "" (e)verybody in the management of [the telecommunications company] & in the ministry are waiting their part of the cake.""
In December 2019, Ericsson agreed to pay about $1.06 billion, including a $521 million criminal fine, and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to settle U.S. corruption charges over its activities in Djibouti and four other countries.
Ericsson Egypt pleaded guilty at the time to a related bribery conspiracy charge.
Bereket was charged with conspiring to violate the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and conspiring to commit money laundering, and faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.

He is at large, and a lawyer for him could not be located. Ericsson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street sank and European stocks suffered their worst one-day rout in three weeks on Wednesday on uncertainty over the pace of economic recovery, as the dollar pared gains following dovish remarks from a Federal Reserve official.
Accommodative central bank policies and optimism about reopening economies have pushed equities to record levels but concerns are growing about the impact of rising coronavirus infections due to the Delta variant.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to end at 35,029.19 points. The S&P 500 lost 0.13% to 4,514, with materials, energy and technology sectors leading the declines.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.57% to 15,286.68.
Markets are also still assessing data from last week which showed the U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in seven months in August, and wondering how the U.S. central bank will respond.
The New York Fed Bank President on Wednesday said the central bank's decision on tapering is not indicative of timing for lifting rates. Those dovish remarks followed comments from St. Louis Fed Bank President that the tapering plan should move forward despite the slowdown in job growth.
""Everything is tapering, tapering, tapering. We are looking at every single central bank - when is the next one?"" said Eddie Cheng, head of international multi-asset portfolio management at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, though he added: ""The Delta variant impact is still running like a wild card"".

MSCI's world equity index fell 0.42% after seven consecutive days of gains and European stocks dropped to their lowest in nearly three weeks. Britain's FTSE 100 struck two-week lows.
""September is the month investors confront reality,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, pointing to uncertainty over the Fed's tapering plans and inflation fears as a reason investors are taking profits or reallocating funds.
The coronavirus Delta variant and concerns over the economic recovery were also weighing.
A Fed report on Wednesday showed the U.S. economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August as concerns grew over how the renewed surge of coronavirus cases would affect the economic recovery.
""What is likely ahead of us is a continued but temporary deceleration of economic activity of one to three months which likely started in August,"" Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said earlier in the session.

The dollar paired some gains after jumping to a one-week high against a basket of other major currencies. It also hit a one-week peak against the the single currency and was trading at $1.1826.
The dollar's strength offset investors' risk aversion to pressure bullion to a two-week low. Spot prices fell 0.1% and gold futures settled down 0.3% at $1,793.50. [GOL/]

Germany's 10-year Bund yield also hit eight-week highs before edging lower to -0.32%. 
""Fears that central banks might start to taper their asset purchases seems to have knocked away a little confidence, particularly given tomorrow’s ECB decision where many expect we’ll begin to see the start of that process, not least with inflation there running at its highest levels in almost a decade,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.71%, stemming an eight-session string of gains. 
Bitcoin extended the previous day's rout, down 1.6%.

Shares of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc dropped over 3% after the firm revealed it has received a legal notice from the top U.S. markets regulator.
Brent settled up 1.3% at $72.60 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 1.4% at$69.30 a barrel, with prices supported by a slow restart to production in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida hit the region. [O/R]

However, as demand has started to decline lately, homebuilder stocks  Lennar  (LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH), Meritage Homes (NYSE:MTH), and  LGI Homes  (NASDAQ:LGIH) might witness a correction in the near term.The proliferation of remote work, low mortgage rates, and diminished supply caused an increase in the U.S. new home sales in July 2021 by 1% following a significant decline for three straight months. Demand for homes is slowing in response to higher prices.
The national inventory of active listings decreased 25.8% year-over-year in August. The median national home price for active listings declined from $385,000 in July to $380,000 in August.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 04:22PM ET</span>",Analysis-Bolsonaro rallies base but turns off allies and markets,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro filled wide avenues in Brazil's biggest cities with his supporters on Tuesday, but the depth of their fervor did little to help his narrowing appeal.
While his attacks on the Supreme Court and election integrity may keep his core base activated - roughly one in four Brazilians - they could hurt his attempts to advance his agenda in Congress or build another winning coalition in next year's election.
""The establishment is convinced now that pacifying Brazil is not possible with Bolsonaro at the helm. This is leading to his political isolation,"" said political analyst Leonardo Barreto of Vector Consultancy in Brasilia.
""The political and economic classes feel he can no longer be trusted... and economic reforms are not possible anymore with Bolsonaro and the chronic instability he has brought,"" he said. 
Brazilian financial markets reeled on re-opening after the Tuesday national holiday. The currency weakened more than 2% against the dollar, as the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell nearly 3%, with traders citing concerns about Bolsonaro's hardening rhetoric.
Bolsonaro has vowed to ignore decisions by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, claiming they are unconstitutional.
That could undermine delicate negotiations with the top court over the government's payment of legally mandated debts, which threaten to blow a hole in next year's budget.
The president's approval ratings have already tumbled on the growing impression that he is more concerned with institutional battles than taming inflation or addressing the world's second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak. 
Opinion polls show him losing the 2022 campaign to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva if a vote were held today. Bolsonaro supporters at rallies https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolsonaro-supporters-breach-police-cordon-ahead-tuesdays-marches-2021-09-07 on Tuesday said that he could only lose the election if there was fraud.
MODERATES TURNED OFF 
Several associations of industry, finance and even agribusiness leaders have called in recent weeks for the president to respect the constitution and reduce tensions with Congress and the courts. 
There are signs Bolsonaro's vocal disregard for constitutional checks and balances may also be forcing moderates in Brasilia off the fence and squarely into the opposition.
Centrist parties such as the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which was a Bolsonaro ally until recently, said on Tuesday they will start discussing their support for impeaching the president.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao said the government had enough votes in Congress to block any attempt to impeach Bolsonaro.
""I don't see there being a climate for the president's impeachment, either in the population or within Congress itself,"" Mourao told reporters on Wednesday.
Arthur Lira, speaker of the lower house of Congress, has been reluctant to open proceedings on the more than 100 impeachment requests, calling it a source of unneeded instability.
However, even Lira, a Bolsonaro ally, has appeared fed up with the president's ongoing attacks against Brazil's electronic voting system, saying https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-speaker-appeals-political-calm-says-paper-ballot-debate-closed-2021-09-08 on Wednesday he would not allow further discussion of a paper-based voting proposal rejected by Congress last month.
""It's time to say enough of this infinite negative looping,"" Lira said in his first public remarks after Tuesday's demonstrations.
Citing Bolsonaro's attacks on senators and Supreme Court justices, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco canceled this week's sessions scheduled to debate new laws. A proposed income tax overhaul cleared the lower house but is now stuck in the Senate.
Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the diminished prospects for legislation change.
Former Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who was fired last year over disagreements with the president over handling the pandemic, said Bolsonaro successfully mobilized his base on Tuesday: mainly older white voters. But he lacked the poorer masses and moderate Brazilians that he needs for re-election. 
""The moderate Brazilian, the centrist, has left Bolsonaro and won't come back. They have no reason to do so,"" he said.

Mandetta said removing Bolsonaro by impeachment is not possible, and the president does not have power to stage a coup.
""We will have to tolerate this until the election. And it will be a sordid, tough election,"" Mandetta said.

Sanofi said it has offered $9.50 per share in cash for Kadmon, representing a total equity value of approximately $1.9 billion on a fully diluted basis, and that both companies' boards unanimously approved the transaction.
Sanofi's price tag represents a 79% premium on Kadmon's $5.30 closing price on Tuesday. 
""The acquisition supports Sanofi's strategy to continue to grow its general medicines core assets and will immediately add Rezurock (belumosudil) to its transplant portfolio,"" the two companies said in a joint statement.
Rezurock, a treatment for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), was approved in July by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
""Kadmon's pipeline includes drug candidates for immune and fibrotic diseases as well as immuno-oncology therapies"", the companies said.
Sanofi is under pressure to revive its drug pipeline and is also eager to overcome setbacks in the COVID-19 vaccine race.

The Kadmon transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to Sanofi's EPS in 2022.
At Tuesday's closing price of 86,95 euros, Sanofi's share price is up 10.5% since the start of the year, underperforming a Stoxx 600 Europe health care index that has risen 18% during that time.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>","Leon Black says accuser, eyeing payday, made up Jeffrey Epstein claims","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman suing former Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc Chief Executive Leon Black for sexual abuse and defamation made up ""demonstrably false"" new accusations linking him to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Black's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The claim in a New York state court filing was in response to Guzel Ganieva's amended civil lawsuit, where she said the private equity billionaire flew her to Florida https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/russian-model-suing-leon-black-alleges-billionaires-ties-jeffrey-epstein-2021-08-10 in 2008 for a possible sexual encounter with his ""best friend,"" Epstein.
""Black's billions and his powerful connections will not prevent the truth from coming out,"" Ganieva's lawyer, Jeanne Christensen, said in a statement. ""We are confident that a jury of Ms. Ganieva's peers will hold Black accountable.""
Ganieva, a former Russian model in her late 30s, is seeking unspecified damages from Black, accusing https://www.reuters.com/business/womans-lawsuit-accuses-leon-black-defamation-violent-behavior-2021-06-01 the 70-year-old of rape and other sexual abuse, forcing her to sign a 2015 nondisclosure agreement, and defaming her by claiming she tried to extort him.
Black, who is married, has denied https://www.reuters.com/world/us/leon-black-rejects-russian-womans-claims-violent-behavior-files-countersuit-2021-07-19 the abuse claims. He has also said he paid Ganieva $100,000 a month for several years not to discuss their consensual 6-1/2-year relationship, after she demanded $100 million.
The payments stopped after Ganieva tweeted about Black in March.
In Wednesday's filing, Black's lawyers challenged Ganieva's ""miraculous sudden recall"" for her Aug. 9 amended complaint of ""shocking acts of sexual torture and threats to traffic her"" that were omitted from her original June 1 complaint.
The lawyers said these included ""gratuitous"" claims involving Epstein that flight records and other evidence would show were untrue.
""Ganieva has a history of inventing tales of bullying, harassment, disrespect -- and worse -- in the hopes of winning a payday for herself,"" the filing said.
Black stepped down https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-apollo-global-ceo/leon-black-step-downs-as-apollo-ceo-after-review-of-epstein-ties-idUKKBN29U2LK from Apollo this year after an outside independent review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning.
The review also said Black was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities.
Black has publicly said he regretted his involvement with Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Wednesday's filing also said Black was no longer pursuing his earlier defamation counterclaims against Ganieva, a move his lawyers have said would let him focus on defending himself.
Ganieva's lawyers have said court rules forbade withdrawing the counterclaims because their client had responded to them, and that Black countersued to win positive media attention.

1658,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>","Dave & Busters, Initial Jobless Claims, Continuing Claims: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks cooled on Wednesday and were down heading into the last half-hour of trading as investors fretted about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, which has the potential to blunt the economic recovery.
Those concerns are being fanned further by uncertainty about when and how much the Federal Reserve will begin buying fewer bonds each month as it takes its foot off the pedal of economic stimulus. 
Everyone expects the Fed will act eventually, but people are still arguing about whether that time will be this year or next. In its periodic Beige Book -- a compilation of reports on the economy from its district banks -- the Fed said the economy ""downshifted slightly"" in August.
A surge of the coronavirus hit dining, travel and tourism, the Fed said Wednesday. Overall, the economy reflects the comeback from the pandemic, and with it rising prices and labor shortages.  
In individual stocks,  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) fell after the Securities and Exchange Commission threatened to sue the crypto exchange if it goes ahead with plans to launch a crypto lending product.  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) fell, too, after saying it would acquire Japan’s Paidy, a “buy now, pay later” firm.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Has fun returned? 
Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY), which is part restaurant, part bar, and part arcade for adults and kids, is expected to report an adjusted profit per share of 56 cents on revenue of $356.6 million, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The company could be seen as a proxy for how the entertainment industry is coming back from the pandemic, and investors will be listening for any comments on the outlook for the rest of the year.
2. Initial jobless claims
Last week, we got a tepid report on August jobs from the government. On Thursday, the government releases data on the number of new jobless claims made in the previous week. The number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time in the U.S. is predicted to come in around 335,000 for the week ending June 5 from 340,000 for the week before. The report comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
3. Continuing jobless claims
Even more interesting, perhaps, are the number of people who continued to file for unemployment, especially now that the extra pandemic assistance has expired. Continuing jobless claims in the U.S., a measure of people receiving unemployment benefits for a while, are expected to fall to 2.744 million in the week ending September 4, from 2.748 million the week before. That report also comes out at 8:30 AM ET.

Let’s discuss.Lingering concerns about the spike in COVID-19 cases globally due to the fast-spreading Delta variant and its impact on the economic recovery, coupled with the fading fiscal stimulus, have made investors anxious about the tenor of the economic recovery. In addition, with wages rising even with weak hiring, worries about inflation have resulted in a bumpy September for the stock market.
However, despite these concerns, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that current, heightened, inflation is transitory and should eventually fall to target levels. Furthermore, notable job gains last month and a slight decline in the unemployment rate should buoy the stock market in the coming months. This bullish outlook and the continuing low-interest-rate environment bode well for small-cap stocks.
Therefore, we think fundamentally sound small-cap stocks  AdvanSix Inc . (ASIX), Vera Bradley, Inc. (VRA), ARC Document Solutions, Inc. (ARC), which look undervalued at their current price levels, could be solid bets now.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - More than three-quarters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's offshore oil and natural gas output remained shut on Wednesday as the fallout from Hurricane Ida continued to hamper production.
Some 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production and over 1.72 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output were shut-in. More than 70 platforms of the 288 evacuated ahead of the August storm remain unoccupied, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) disclosed that 7 of its 10 offshore production platforms remain offline since Ida. Restarts have been delayed by damages to offshore oil and gas transfer facilities and onshore processing operations, it said.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) this week said a production hub that brings oil and gas from three offshore oilfields was damaged by the storm. It has been unable to determine the full extent of the damage or provide a schedule for restarting.
POWER REMAINS OUT 
There were about 325,000 homes and in Louisiana without power on Wednesday, down from more than 1 million last week. Areas struggling to regain power and water include regions essential to bringing crews and equipment offshore. 
Refineries away from the coast have been regaining power and beginning to restart.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) plans to complete restarting its 520,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge refinery this week, sources familiar with operations said on Wednesday.
Exxon requested 1.5 million barrels of crude from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve for Baton Rouge. 
Analysts expect other refineries to also request crude if Gulf's oil producers cannot restore output after assessing damages caused by the storm and performing repairs.

Refiners struggling to get processing online contributed to a shortage of fuel in Louisiana, which is slowing helicopter companies' ability to re-deploy staff to offshore platforms.
Ida's impact over U.S. offshore energy output makes it one of the most costly since back-to-back storms in 2005 cut output for months, according to the latest data and historical records.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 02:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Activist ENKRAFT takes stake in RWE, calls for separation of lignite ops","By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Activist fund ENKRAFT has taken a stake in RWE and is calling for a separation of the company's brown coal activities to remove the burden of a legacy business that has weighed on the value of shares in Germany's largest power producer.
ENKRAFT, which has a track record in investing in the renewable energy sector, now holds more than 500,000 shares in RWE -- worth 16.4 million euros ($19 million) at current prices -- it said in a letter to management seen by Reuters.
This gives it the right to request items be put on the agenda of annual general meetings under German stock market regulation.
Activist investor Engine No. 1 has shown that small stakes can be effective when it won three board seats at oil major  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) earlier this year through what sources said was a mere $12.5 million investment.
RWE has undergone a major shift in recent years and is now one of Europe's largest renewable players with an installed capacity of 9.4 gigawatts (GW), a result of the break-up of former division Innogy in a deal with E.ON.
The company plans to boost its renewables portfolio to more than 13 GW by the end of 2022 via net investments of 5 billion euros.
At the same time, it still operates legacy nuclear and coal assets, both marked for gradual shutdowns as part of Germany's efforts to raise its share of renewables and cut carbon dioxide emissions to be in line with the Paris climate agreement.
RWE is ""no longer investible"" for many under stricter sustainability criteria, ENKRAFT said in the letter addressed to RWE Chief Executive Markus Krebber, who took the helm in May.
RWE's EV/EBITDA multiple - a valuation metric that measures the ratio between enterprise value and core earnings - is 7.8, according to Refinitiv data, a steep discount to renewable energy pure plays including Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Portugal's EDPR, which trade at 17.8 and 14.7, respectively.
POTENTIAL TO RAISE VALUE
Separating RWE's brown coal, or lignite, operations would be a way to close that gap and create value, ENKRAFT said in the letter. 
""We are convinced that a focus on the promising renewable energy business and a fast and possibly gradual separation of the lignite activities brings with it an enormous potential to raise value,"" ENKRAFT managing director Benedikt Kormaier said.
A spokesperson for RWE confirmed ENKRAFT's approach: ""As is the case with every investor we have offered them to have a conversation about our business strategy.""
At the end of 2020, RWE had 8.55 GW of lignite assets, accounting for more than a fifth of its total installed generation capacity and also making it one of Europe's largest emitters of CO2.
RWE's continued exposure to coal has caused concern among some investors, with Norway's sovereign wealth fund selling its stake last year and top-10 investor Amundi criticising the speed of its planned phase-out of the fuel.
Shareholders Deka Investment and Union Investment have also called for an acceleration of the group's brown coal exit, which under current agreements with the German government will happen by 2038 at the latest.
ENKRAFT also said an accelerated phase-out could possibly realise hidden reserves of up to 13 billion euros which it estimates are tied to RWE's purchase of carbon emission permits.
Krebber last month said there were no plans to change RWE's structure -- which spans offshore, onshore, solar as well as coal and nuclear -- adding that all technologies were needed to address the energy transition.

ENKRAFT also owns shares in renewable project developers PNE AG and Energiekontor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) told U.S. regulators on Wednesday that Elon Musk does not believe government regulations apply to the billionaire who heads Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and SpaceX as the companies spar over rival satellite-based internet plans.
In a harshly worded filing with the Federal Communications Commission, Amazon accused Musk of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules, including several Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements.
""Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks,"" Amazon wrote. ""If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would be keeping the commission very busy.""
Both SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. The FCC and FAA declined to comment.
Amazon's Project Kuiper, a planned $10 billion network of over 3,000 satellites that will provide high-speed internet from space, faces stiff competition from SpaceX's Starlink network.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin has challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX.
Amazon on Aug. 25 asked the FCC to reject a proposed SpaceX revision to its satellite configuration plans, saying it was at odds with FCC rules and left ""nearly every major detail unsettled.""
Last week, SpaceX accused Amazon in its own filing with the FCC of seeking to delay SpaceX's plan, saying it was ""only the latest in its continuing efforts to slow down competition.""
SpaceX added: ""While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation."" 

SpaceX suggested Amazon ""as it falls behind competitors ... is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind.""
Amazon's filing said ""SpaceX has just one name for any private company that dares point out its flouting of laws and regulations: 'anticompetitive.'""

Investing.com – Coupa Software stock (NASDAQ:COUP) fell by more than 3% in Wednesday’s trading as the company’s higher forecast for annual revenue still implies a slowing down of its growth after a pandemic-induced surge in demand for its cost-control solutions.
The company’s annual revenue forecast of $707 million at midpoint translates into a year-on-year growth of around 31%, a slowdown from 39% growth in the previous financial year.  
Traders chose to overlook the higher guidance that was revised from the June forecast of $682.5 million in revenue at midpoint. The company had forecasted a net loss on an annual basis then but now sees an adjusted profit of 28 cents per share at midpoint in the current financial year.
On a year-on-year basis, the company’s third-quarter revenue forecast of $177.5 million at midpoint is 33% higher.
Coupa is a technology platform providing solutions that help businesses improve cost controls, compliance and anything related to spending management. Companies spent more on digitizing and optimizing back-office operations during the pandemic.
Second-quarter total revenue rose 42% on-year to $179.2 million. Adjusted profit per share was 26 cents. Both revenue and EPS beat estimates."

The agency began holding open meetings after Chair Lina Khan was sworn in June. Next week, the five commissioners will also consider whether to scrap guidelines put in place during the Trump administration regarding deals that combine a company with one of its suppliers.
The staff report will include Big Tech acquisitions from 2010 to 2019, some of which were not reported to antitrust enforcers because of their small size.
The Big Tech firms, which also include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), have been under antitrust scrutiny for more than two years. The FTC has sued Facebook while the Justice Department sued Google. Others remain under investigation.

The agency had sent demands for information to five big tech firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in February 2020, saying that it wanted to probe whether any of the smaller deals resulted in harm to competition.

ADM agreed to buy a 75% stake in P4 Companies, maker of pet treats and supplements PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, the Pound Bakery and NutraDine, in a deal that values the four enterprises at about $600 million, the company said Wednesday in a statement. The move adds to ADM’s other investments in animal nutrition of Crosswind pet treats in 2017 and pet-food maker Neovia in 2019. 
Chicago-based ADM and other companies that make money buying and storing crops have been moving to sell more value-added products to balance returns in the volatile bulk commodities sector. Meanwhile, pet ownership and adoption rates have climbed as the coronavirus pandemic kept people at home. Grains trader Scoular Co. opened its first freeze-dried pet-food ingredient factory in Nebraska last year.
Vince Macciocchi, president of ADM’s nutrition business, said annual global sales of pet good could reach $140 billion by 2026, up from $110 billion in 2021. “We’ve grown to meet that demand,” he said.

(Reuters) - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests.
In a blog post, Twitter said certain users can create Communities and more will be added in the coming months. The company did not disclose the number of users who can create Communities in the test, but any user can participate in a group if invited. 
Communities are publicly visible, though at this stage people need to be invited to join by a moderator or another member.
The social media company has in recent months rolled out a bevy of new features including subscription-based ""super follows"" and live audio chat rooms, aiming to turn around years of business stagnation.
Larger social media rival Facebook has pushed its Groups, which can be private or public, as a strategic priority since 2017. But Facebook Groups have also been used to spread political and health misinformation and organize extremist activity, causing the company to announce changes to the types of Groups it recommends to users.
Twitter said it would adapt its rules and enforcement actions to keep people safe in Communities, including developing ways to proactively identify groups that could be problematic. 
""Some of the initial Communities we're testing surround popular conversations on Twitter,"" said David Regan, staff product manager at Twitter, in the blog post. He said these included ""dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare, and astrology, with many more to come.""

Users will act as Community moderators, setting and enforcing standards for their groups. During the test, the company is approving the moderators and will work closely with them.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -Nvidia on Wednesday sought EU antitrust approval of its $54 billion takeover of British chip designer Arm, according to a European Commission filing, with regulators likely to echo worries similar to those voiced by the UK watchdog last month.
The world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips announced the deal last year, triggering concerns in the semiconductor industry over whether Arm could remain a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers and rivals.
Worried customers include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Arm customers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) are backing the deal.
""We are working through the regulatory process and we look forward to engaging with the European Commission to address any concerns they may have. This transaction will be beneficial to Arm, its licensees, competition, and the industry,"" Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) said in a statement.
It has previously said it would maintain Arm as a neutral technology supplier. 
The EU competition enforcer can clear the $54 billion deal with or without concessions after its preliminary review or it can follow up with a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.

Britain's competition watchdog has warned that the deal could damage competition and weaken rivals, and required a further lengthy investigation.
Arm, owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, is a major player in global semiconductors, key to technologies from artificial intelligence and quantum computing to 5G telecoms networks. Its designs power nearly every smartphone and millions of other devices.

(Reuters) - U.S. payments giant  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) said it would acquire Japanese buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm Paidy in a $2.7 billion largely cash deal, taking another step to claim the top spot in an industry experiencing a pandemic-led boom.
The deal tracks rival  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ)'s agreement last month to buy Australian BNPL success story Afterpay Ltd for $29 billion, which experts said was likely the beginning of a consolidation in the sector.
Buying Paidy will help PayPal expand in a country where online shopping volume has more than tripled over the last 10 years to some $200 billion, but more than two-thirds of all purchases are still paid in cash, PayPal said in an investor presentation.
""I wouldn't view this (deal) as impacting the U.S. BNPL market but more as PayPal's route into the Japanese market,"" Kunaal Malde, analyst at Atlantic Equities, said.
Shares of the payments company were up 1% in heavy volumes in premarket trading, while those of rival Square were marginally lower. 
Paidy, with more than 6 million registered users, offers payment services that allow Japanese shoppers to make purchases online, and then pay for them each month at a convenience store or via bank transfer.
Japanese consumers have traditionally favoured cash but that has changed in recent years, mostly in the cities, said Eiji Taniguchi a senior economist at think-tank Japan Research Institute Ltd.
""One of the notable things about Japan's BNPL market compared to the United States or Europe is that most users clear their outstanding balance by the end of the month in one payment. In Japan accumulating debt is more frowned on.""
Fuelled by federal stimulus checks, the BNPL business model has been hugely successful during the pandemic, especially in western countries. 
These firms make money by charging merchants a fee to offer small point-of-sale loans which shoppers repay in interest-free instalments, bypassing credit checks.
Atlantic Equities analyst Malde said the Square-Afterpay deal increased the urgency of establishing BNPL positions and could have accelerated PayPal's deal for Paidy. He expects more such deals in the sector.
Paypal, which is considered a leader in the BNPL market, entered Australia last year, raising the stakes for smaller companies such as Sezzle Inc. 
The U.S. payments firm is among the big winners of the pandemic as more people used its services to shop online and pay bills to avoid stepping out. 
Businesses, forced to move their stores online, also flocked to PayPal, boosting its customer base of active accounts to more than 400 million worldwide.
Paidy, whose backers include Soros Capital Management,  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Japanese trading house Itochu Corp, will continue to operate its existing business and maintain its brand after the acquisition. 
Founder and Chairman Russell Cummer and Chief Executive Riku Sugie will continue to hold their roles.
The Financial Times had reported last month that Paidy was considering an initial public offering.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and will be minimally dilutive to PayPal's adjusted earnings per share in 2022.
BofA advised PayPal on the deal and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised Paidy. White & Case was lead legal adviser for PayPal and Cooley LLP and Mori Hamada & Matsumoto for Paidy.

Because the DJIA could regain its upward momentum in the coming weeks, we think some of its component companies, namely UnitedHealth Group (UNH), McDonald’s (MCD), Honeywell International (HON), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), could be great additions to one’s portfolio. Let’s discuss.After the Labor Department's hiring report stated that U.S. employers added only 235,000 jobs in August, barely one-third of the consensus forecast of 730,000 jobs added, global stock markets and Wall Street futures climbed on Monday, supported by expectations that the Federal Reserve may postpone the withdrawal of economic stimulus. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined yesterday on concerns surrounding the Delta Variant’s impact on the economic recovery, some investors and analysts remain optimistic.
Officials indicated that the Fed might decide this month on when to initiate tapering of its bond purchases. Because employment is a crucial factor, the Fed wants to ensure that an economic recovery is enroute for sure. This position has fostered positive investor sentiment. The Fed’s postponement in reducing bond purchases will ensure capital continues to flow in the financial system to aid economic recovery.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound Dow Jones stocks UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA).

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) fell 1.1% Wednesday as a Delaware judge said the company’s board must face a lawsuit by shareholders over two fatal crashes of its 737 Max aircraft that led to the death of 346 people.
According to Judge Vice-Chancellor Morgan Zurn of Delaware’s Court of Chancery, the defendants had pursued the agenda of rapid production and profit maximization while ignoring their oversight authority.
Boeing said it was “disappointed in the court’s decision to allow the plaintiffs’ case to proceed past this preliminary stage. The company has previously said the lawsuits presented a misleading picture of its position on the accidents.
Zurn said the company had ignored the ""red flags"" about the safety of the aircraft and its anti-stall system, following the crash of Lion Air flight 610 in October 2018.
In that incident, all 189 people on board were killed when the plane crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. A November 2018 report by The Wall Street Journal had found that a new flight-control system known as MCAS was suspected of playing a significant role in the crash.
Less than five months later, all 157 on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight died when it crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa. The second incident led to an almost two-year global grounding of the 737 Max fleet. The manufacturer secured the U.S. regulators’ nod to fly the plane again in November last year.
In January, Boeing settled criminal charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department in connection with the two crashes. The settlement included $2.2 billion in compensation to the families of the deceased and a $243 million fine.
Tuesday, the company appointed Matt Welch as vice president of investor relations. He succeeds Maurita Sutedja who moved on following more than a decade of leadership within several finance roles at Boeing.

The Europe-focused STOXX 600 index fell 1.1%, with automobile stocks leading losses with a 2.2% drop.
Finnish tyre maker Nokian Tyres was the worst performer in the sector, down 4.4% amid investor disappointment with the firm's new margin targets.

The central bank is expected to announce a reduction in bond buying on Thursday, with analysts polled by Reuters forecasting purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) falling possibly as low as 60 billion euros ($70.91 billion) a month from the current 80 billion euros.
Austria's central bank chief Robert Holzmann, considered a hawkish member of the ECB, also said the central bank could tighten policy sooner than many expect as inflationary pressures could prove to be persistent.
After hitting a record high in mid-August, the STOXX 600 has hovered below those levels as worries over central bank policies and signs of slowing global growth kept investors on edge.

It also said it would crack down on illegal behaviour in the ride-hailing industry.

Revenue was 160% higher at 370 million ringgit, boosted by cargo revenues. Under its digital arm, revenue from its logistics business tripled while the fintech unit revenue was 56% higher.
Net loss for April-June was 41.6% lower at 580 million ringgit ($139.66 million), compared with a loss of 992 million ringgit a year ago when the airline hibernated its fleet at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

AirAsia said it continued with cost containment measures, including cutting headcount and salaries while managing its capacity to match demand.
The group is in negotiations with lessors to restructure lease terms, it said.
""By the end of the third quarter of 2021, we will have completed two batches of lease restructuring and expect to complete the full exercise by the end of 2021,"" Group CEO Tony Fernandes said in a separate statement.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Ryanair ready to wait years for Boeing to cut prices, says O'Leary","By Gavin Jones and Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) -Ryanair is willing to wait years for Boeing (NYSE:BA) to drop its prices before placing a big new plane order with the U.S. company, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters, while he also downplayed the chance of a deal with rival Airbus. 
The Irish budget airline, one of Boeing's biggest customers, said on Monday it had ended talks over a new order of 737 MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars because the prices on offer were too high.
""We're not wasting any time on those MAX 10 discussions nor will we for a period of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 years until we get to the next crisis,"" O'Leary said in an interview. 
""We at Ryanair have always had the discipline to wait out the cycle.""
Boeing shares opened up around 0.2% after O'Leary's comments, which amplified his recent pressure on Boeing but did not rule out further negotiations. Ryanair shares rose 1.2%.
Europe's largest budget carrier is already the region's biggest MAX customer with 210 of the 197-seat MAX 8-200 on order. It has dangled a fresh order potentially worth $33 billion at list prices for up to 250 of the 230-seat MAX 10.
But O'Leary said there had been a ""fundamental breakdown"" in talks due to the fact that Boeing believed the COVID-19 crisis was effectively over while Ryanair believed the U.S. giant still badly needed an order. 
""Boeing are looking for a price increase while many of their customers are moving to Airbus,"" O'Leary said. 
""We take the view we are still in a period of great crisis. Boeing take the view that now the world is fine and it's all recovered and its latest pricing offer reflects that,"" he said. 
Speaking in Madrid, however, the head of the group's largest airline, Ryanair DAC, struck a mixed tone on the recovery.
""Most European markets are recuperating ... the exception is the UK (where) there's this continued confusion (over COVID-19 restrictions),"" Eddie Wilson told Reuters.
Boeing was not immediately available for comment. On Monday it said it valued Ryanair's business but had to exercise discipline and make decisions that made sense. 
The U.S. giant appears to believe the market is finally moving in its direction after winning a series of orders, including 150 MAX 10 from United Airlines and outselling Airbus on narrow-body jets this year, market experts say.
It has also virtually cleared a stockpile of 200 surplus jets left without homes after the MAX crisis.
Between January and July, Boeing sold 524 of its 737 MAX compared with Airbus's January-August tally of 234 A320-family jets.
TALKS 'CAN BE RESTARTED' AT RIGHT PRICE
Ryanair's rare decision to go public over big-ticket plane negotiations comes after months of wrangling that had already delayed a deal for the largest version of the 737 MAX. 
A large new Ryanair order would provide a boost to the U.S. planemaker as it rebuilds confidence in the MAX, an aircraft grounded for 20 months until November after two fatal crashes. 
It would also speed a tentative industry recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The talks can always be restarted, but only when Boeing realise they need to price competitively,"" O'Leary said. 
Asked if Ryanair might consider Airbus in the medium term, O'Leary said it might, but that Boeing's European rival did not currently have a competitively priced short-haul aircraft either. 
""There is always a prospect that Airbus become a significant supplier. But there is a chance that the Chinese - COMAC - could become a significant supplier to Ryanair in the medium term,"" he said. 
Playing Boeing against Airbus to secure lower prices is doomed to failure as a strategy, he said. 

""Basically its a duopoly,"" he said. ""You don't get leverage by holding discussions with one or the other.""
O'Leary said he was not concerned that the breakdown in talks would leave him with too few planes when his current order is completed in 2025 as Ryanair already had more aircraft on order than any of its competitors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. bank profits fell 8.3% to $70.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 as firms slowed their reductions in credit loss provisions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported on Wednesday.
While profits were still significantly higher than they were a year ago -- up 281% from the second quarter of 2020 -- banks slowed the rate at which they shrank the large cushions they built up at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the second quarter, banks upped their credit loss provisions by $3.7 billion, but those provisions are still down significantly from a year ago, declining $73 billion, or 117.3%. Just 14% of banks reported actually increasing their loss provisions in the last quarter.
Over the last year, the share of profitable banks rose slightly to 95.8%.

The regulator also reported that average net interest margin for banks hit a new record low of 2.5%. 
Loan balances actually grew slightly for the first time since the second quarter of 2020 on the back of stronger borrowing for cars and credit cards. Noncurrent loans were down 10.8% from the first quarter, led by a decline in noncurrent residential loans, which dropped 10.9%.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",$10 billion U.S. battle for Britain's Morrisons heads for auction,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -The $10 billion takeover battle for British supermarket group Morrisons between two U.S. private equity groups looks set to be decided by a rarely used auction process.
Morrisons said on Wednesday it was in talks with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), Fortress Investment Group and Britain's takeover regulator about an auction to settle its future.
Last month, Morrisons agreed a 7 billion pound ($9.6 billion) offer from CD&R, which has former Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser. However, the rival consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress could still trump that bid.
The fight for Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, is the most high-profile looming takeover amid a raft of bids and counter bids, reflecting private equity's appetite for UK Plc.
Morrisons said that as neither bidder had declared its offer final, it was talking to both of them and the Takeover Panel, which governs M&A deals in the UK, about ""an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation"" - which would typically be an auction.
Morrisons said shareholder meetings to vote on the CD&R offer would be convened for around the week starting Oct. 18.
It said any auction would take place prior to these shareholder meetings, on a date announced by the Takeover Panel.
Following completion of an auction, Morrisons shareholders would vote on either a Fortress or a CD&R offer, depending on which offer Morrisons' board recommended.
Morrisons said it expected a scheme document on CD&R's offer to be posted to shareholders around Sept. 25.
CD&R's latest offer is worth 285 pence per Morrisons share - a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid-June.
Fortress, whose last offer was pitched at 272 pence a share, said on Wednesday it ""continues to consider its options.""
Morrisons shares were trading at 291.3 pence at 1044 GMT, indicating investors are hoping for a higher bid.
CD&R had no further comment.
AUCTION PROCESS
The Takeover Panel's standard auction structure is bidding over a five-day period. However, if all parties are in agreement a different structure can be used - for example bidding over just one day.
Last month, the Takeover Panel set up an auction of British inhaler company Vectura for suitors Philip Morris International (N:PM) and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle. However, in the event Carlyle decided not to raise its offer.
Morrisons, which trades from 497 stores and has a staff of over 110,000, reiterated on Wednesday that in addition to the financial terms of any offer it places ""very significant emphasis on the wider responsibilities of ownership"", including the importance of employees, customers, pension trustees and suppliers.
Last month, the trustees of Morrisons' pension schemes warned a takeover by either CD&R or Fortress could ""materially weaken"" the security of the schemes if no additional protection was agreed.

Morrisons is due to publish first half results on Thursday.

1696,By StockNews,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for the Ongoing Global Chip Shortage,"Due to their utility in a plethora of electronic appliances and gadgets, semiconductors are now practically indispensable in the electronics and other industries. To support this digital transformation, governments worldwide have been formulating policies to address a current chip shortage. Thus, we think fundamentally sound semiconductor stocks Texas Instruments (TXN), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and KLA Corporation (KLAC) could be solid bets now. Read on.Semiconductors have a wide range of applications, from vehicles to appliances to smartphones. With an increasing demand for tech-oriented products and the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), semiconductors witnessed unprecedented demand over the past year, triggering a supply shortage as production facilities remained closed for a significant period during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan tech and manufacturing bill in June to address the production bottlenecks and boost domestic manufacturing capacity. The bill allocates $52 billion toward semiconductor production, helping the industry to strengthen its supply chain. In addition, governments of many other countries are similarly investing in the industry to address the shortage. Due to its wide-ranging applications and favorable government policies, global semiconductor sales are expected to increase 19.7% in 2021 and 8.8% in 2022.
Given this backdrop, we expect popular semiconductor companies Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), and KLA Corporation (KLAC) to rally in price substantially in the coming months.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>",AIG names CEO Zaffino as chairman,"(Reuters) -American International Group said on Wednesday Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino would take on the additional role of board chairman from next year, replacing Brian Duperreault.
Zaffino became AIG (NYSE:AIG)'s seventh CEO since 2005 in October last year when the insurer, among the top 10 U.S. carriers by market value, approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company.
Zaffino joined AIG as the global chief operating officer in 2017 and was the point man to execute goals set by Duperreault as part of a turnaround plan launched by him when he took charge of AIG in the same year. 
Duperreault will retire from the board at the end of 2021.
""Peter's transition into the CEO role in March 2021 was seamless and the company is performing exceptionally well,"" said Doug Steenland, lead independent director.

The change at the top comes as AIG plans to use an initial public offering to sell part of its life and retirement business, in which Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) has agreed to buy a sizeable stake.
The insurer beat second-quarter profit estimates last month, with global insurers seeing a fall in coronavirus-related claims due to vaccinations.
